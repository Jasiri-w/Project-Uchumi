https://nation.africa/kenya/counties/kakamega/kakamega-tale-dead-body-deadly-clash-dead-brother-4677512,"A disagreement between two widows in Kakamega over where to bury the remains of their husband has further fuelled tensions between their families, resulting in deaths, injuries and destruction of property.
The burial of the late Joseph Otipa Osundwa, who died in April 2024
was scheduled for June 30 after Mumias Senior Resident Magistrate Marcella Onyango issued an order on June 24.
The body was to be collected from the mortuary at St Mary's Mission Hospital in Mumias on Friday, June 29 and taken to the first wife's home for burial on Saturday, as per the court order.
The family of the first wife, Selpha Maende, then buried Mr Otipa's body at her home in accordance with Luhya custom.
The court had also ordered that the burial costs be borne by the deceased's two wives, children and relatives, while the mortuary bills would be shared equally between the widows.
“This being a family dispute, I direct that each party bears its own costs of the mortuary expenses which should be shared equally,” directed Ms Onyango.
However, the family of the second wife, Margaret Otipa, were furious at the court's decision to grant burial rights to the first family.
They claimed that the deceased had died in their home, where he spent most of his time during his life.
""Our father has been living with our mother for years, so it was unfair for the court to give his body to our stepmother to bury, citing Luhya customs and traditions,"" said one of the sons.
On the day of the burial, all hell broke loose when the first family went to the burial site to bury the remains of the deceased.
Margaret and her children interrupted the procession, sparking a violent confrontation.
The coffin containing Mr Otipa's remains was suddenly thrown to the ground as the pallbearers ran for safety.
The ensuing clash resulted in the death of 87-year-old Mohammed Anyanga, a brother of the deceased.
Mr Anyanga was attacked by one of his nephews while trying to separate the warring parties.
He was rushed to Kakamega County General Hospital where a CT scan revealed that he had suffered a fractured skull and a blood clot in his brain. He later died while undergoing treatment.
Speaking after his father's death, his son, Patrick Anyanga, said life would never be the same between the two families.
""My father was the brother of the deceased. He had every right to intervene and bring peace between the warring families. It was very wrong for a young man who knew his uncle to raise a panga and hack him to death,"" he lamented.
Mumias East sub-county police commander Doris Chemosi confirmed the incident and said investigations had begun.
""Detectives are already questioning and recording statements from those who attended the burial ceremony and witnessed the deadly clash. We expect to make some arrests and charge some people for the killing of the old man as soon as we complete our investigations,"" Ms Chemosi said.
The body of the deceased was taken to St Mary's Mission Hospital mortuary where it is expected to remain until his warring wives agree on a burial site.",2024-07-03
https://nation.africa/kenya/counties/meru/why-meru-county-has-yet-to-pass-a-budget-4677466,"Meru County government is yet to pass its 2024/2025 budget as a standoff between the county assembly and the executive has stalled the budget process for two months.
The county assembly is expected to pass the budget estimates this week and the appropriation bill in two weeks after a protracted battle with the executive over a Sh12.3 billion County Fiscal Strategy Paper (CFSP) 2024.
This is well past the June 30 deadline stipulated in the Public Finance Management (PFM) Act.
The PFM Act, 2012 requires the executive to submit the CFSP to the county assembly by February 28 for approval within 14 days. This is followed by the submission of the county budget estimates to the assembly for approval by April 30.
In Meru, the standoff began when the county assembly passed the 2024 CFSP with several amendments, allocating Sh45 million per ward (Sh1.8 billion) from the development budget.
This clashed with the executive's budget estimates, which allocated Sh15 million to each of the 46 wards.
Section 129 2(b) of the PFM Act states that the executive member for finance ""shall ensure that the budget estimates submitted are in accordance with the resolutions of the county assembly on the county fiscal strategy paper"".
In protest, Finance Executive Ibrahim Mutwiri sought advice from the Controller of Budget (COB), arguing that the MCAs had ""overhauled and changed the basic structure of the PFSP"".
“The assembly ignored the requirement that it has to seek the finance executive views on recommended amendments. The County Assembly introduced its version of the CFSP through changing the provided ceilings…The CFSP was also passed outside the legal timeline,” Mr Mutwiri stated.
Consequently, the Controller of Budget Dr Margaret Nyakang’o hosted a mediation meeting where she directed the feuding parties to enter negotiations and avert a budgetary stalemate.
Speaking to Nation on Monday, July 1, Budget and Appropriations Committee chairperson Jacob Mwirigi said the negotiations occasioned the delay in the budget-making process.
“After negotiations, we agreed on Sh33 million per ward. The executive was to present a memo explaining the discrepancies between the approved county fiscal strategy paper 2024 and the budget estimates proposal. We are late because we received the memorandum last week,” Mr Mwirigi explained.
Read: Did they have to die? Kin of those killed in anti-Finance Bill demos ask
According to the memorandum by Mr Mutwiri, it was resolved that each ward be allocated Sh33 million for development.
“The ward-based projects for the 2024/2025 financial year will be as follows: Sh18 as equitable allocation, Sh7 million from the Fuel Levy fund and Sh8 million for flagship projects. This will ensure an allocation of approximately Sh1.5 billion on development,” Finance Executive Ibrahim Mutwiri stated.
Mr Mwirigi said the Assembly now needs at least a week to conduct public participation on the budget estimates.
""The Assembly will conduct public participation on Wednesday and hopefully pass the estimates in a special sitting this week. We hope to pass the Appropriation Bill next week,"" he said.
Majority Whip Jim Muchui said the Controller of Budget had been informed of the delays in the budget process.
""Each ward will also receive Sh3 million for education bursaries, making a total of Sh36 million in the new financial year,"" Mr Muchui said.
The move by the MCAs to allocate most of the development funds to the wards comes amid allegations that Governor Kawira Mwangaza is discriminating against wards whose MCAs oppose her.

https://nation.africa/kenya/counties/nakuru/kevin-madanga-kagoni-the-pain-of-a-mother-4677382,"What you need to know:
- At least 23 youths were shot during Tuesday's protest in Nakuru County.
- Three succumbed to their injuries, the rest are receiving treatment in hospital.
Violet Gwazima clings to one of the few photographs she has of her teenage son, Kevin Madanga Kagoni.
His life was cut short by three bullets during last Tuesday's deadly protests against the 2024 Finance Bill, which left more than 20 people dead.
Kevin, 24, a first-year student at Migori Teachers Training College, was among thousands of protesters who stormed various parts of the country, calling on lawmakers to vote against the 2024 Finance Bill, which seeks to increase taxes.
Police opened fire and several people were killed.
Gwazima is in pain and has yet to come to terms with her son's death.
When the Nation caught up with her at Nakuru Level Five Hospital, during the post-mortem on her son's body, she said her light had been extinguished and her hope shattered.
""This is so painful. Did they have to kill my son? The police could have arrested him instead of shooting him and yet he was a peaceful demonstrator,"" she told the Nation.
""As a family, we are asking for justice for my son. We want the relevant bodies to speed up investigations and arrest the police officer who shot him and have him prosecuted in court.""
Kevin’s sister, Mercy Khavete, said Kevin had been sent home from college because of school fee arrears and was helping their mother at their hotel in Ngata area of Nakuru to raise the required school fees.
She said Kevin left home on Tuesday morning and informed his older brother that he was joining his fellow youths on the streets to protest against the tax proposals in the Finance Bill. Kevin went missing that Tuesday.
For three days, the family searched for him at hospitals and police stations, but there were no records of him there.
“The three days he was missing we lived in agony as a family. We heard that two youth had been shot but we brushed it off. We didn't know that he was among those shot during the protests. He was taken to the hospital as an unknown person,"" his sister recalls.
His family later found his lifeless body at Nakuru Level Five Hospital mortuary.
""He always helped a lot at home. Whenever he was at home, he used to wake up at 3am and help our mother to prepare food for our hotel. He died at a young age fighting for his rights and those of other Kenyans,"" Khavete added.
His brother, Allan Kagoni, said he tried to call him on Tuesday evening but his phone was switched off and he thought Kevin had decided to spend the night with a friend.
During the three days they searched for him, his family hoped he was staying with friends.
When Allan visited the mortuary at Nakuru Level Five Hospital last Friday, he found his brother's body.
""At the mortuary, even the attendant was surprised to see me there very early on Friday morning.
""After I told him about my brother, he asked me to call my other relatives first. But he warned me not to say anything about the body.
""Later, we went to see his body. He had been shot three times. He had two bullet wounds in his chest and one in his neck,"" he recalled.
""We learnt that Kevin was brought to the facility on Tuesday evening by good Samaritans. He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and succumbed to injuries on Thursday at 8pm.""
Zachariah Ngugi, a friend, said the last time they were together was last Tuesday when Kevin and another friend visited him.
He said the two friends found him watching the protest live on television and Kevin jokingly said he was going to join his fellow youths in fighting for the rights of Kenyans.
Ngugi said he pleaded with Kevin not to join the protests, but it was all in vain.
“I called him at around 4pm on Tuesday to inquire about his whereabouts but the call went unanswered. I called him again at around 9pm and the phone was switched off,"" he said.
Ngugi described Kevin as a hardworking and brave man who always stood up for his rights.
At least 23 youths were shot during Tuesday's protest in Nakuru County.
Three succumbed to their injuries, while the rest are receiving treatment at various health facilities, including Nakuru Level Five Hospital.",2024-07-03
https://nation.africa/kenya/counties/turkana/a-balancing-act-kenya-walks-tight-rope-to-please-refugees-and-locals-4677318,"What you need to know:
- Residents feel authorities are playing favourites to refugees at the expense of hosts.
- There are 283,969 refugees and asylum seekers at Kakuma Refugee Camp and Kalobeyei Integrated Settlement.
Kakuma Refugee Camp in Kenya’s Turkana County is the only home Rose Chelia has known for the past 22 years.
She fled the Second Sudanese Civil War (which eventually led to the secession of South Sudan in 2011) and found refuge this camp in the north-western part of Kenya.
She was a child then and has never left Kenya. For her, being asked to leave presents a dilemma: the camp is congested with limited basic supplies. But it is a home she has known since she was a child. Yet she is not a Kenyan per se.
This dilemma may, from November this year, be solved after the Kenyan government agreed to provide the estimated 700,000 refugees in Kenya with a special type of identification to enable them move around to do business or seek some type of work, or even go to school like locals.
Known as Shirika Plan, it could cost up to $1 billion to run and upgrade the Kakuma, and Dadaab Refugee camp (in Garissa County), both of which will be turned into formal municipalities.
Ms Chelia may breathe a sigh of relief because the government had in March 2021 issued an ultimatum on closure of refugee camps, which it had cited as a source of insecurity.
“Up to now I don't know our the direction to my home because I have never gone back after fleeing war. I have spent my childhood ages at the camp, and through interaction with other more than 20 nationalists, I believe that my lifestyle is totally different from the people living in South Sudan,” Ms Chelia said in an interview on last week.
Her story is not different from that of Mr Salum Ramadhan, from Democratic Republic of Congo. He arrived here in 1992. Kakuma then was 17km2 of land that would later be divided into four sections, now all full of camps, homes for refugees for decades.
""I fled civil war in my country in 2011 and despite the challenges I am happy Kenya gave me a second and peaceful home to restart my life,"" Mr Ramadhan said.
When the population at Kakuma refugee camp hit 188,000 people, congestion that led to rise in insecurity and deplorable living conditions, Kenya agreed to establish the Kalobeyei Integrated Settlement located 20 kilometres, a 15km2 piece of land, in 2015.
It came after a year of negotiations between the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the National Government in Nairobi, the County Government of Turkana and the host community elders.
With time, however, the government ran out of hospitality to keep offering more space. Insecurity issues also fueled suspicion that some criminals were hiding in the camps. UNHCR often refuted this claims at Kakuma, and Dadaab.
Legally, Kenya as a signatory to various international treaties at the UN, and the African Union pm the protection of refugees cannot force them out.
It can also not shut down the camp unless they agree to. Turning the camps into municipals has become a middle ground, if it actually happens.
But residents feel authorities are playing favourites to refugees at the expense of hosts.
Residents of Turkana West Sub County, where these camps are located, have said, they have continued suffering the brunt of hosting refugees ranging from environmental degradation, shrinking grazing fields and competition in accessing basic services such as water and healthcare.
Officially, there are 283,969 refugees and asylum seekers at Kakuma Refugee Camp and Kalobeyei Integrated Settlement, as at the end of February this year.
The Kalobeyei settlement was established through a Kalobeyei Integrated Socio-Economic Development Program (KISEDP), a Turkana-based initiative that sought to facilitate collaboration and coordination between the Kenyan government, UN agencies, development partners, NGOs, private Sector and civil society to build sustainable services and economic activities at the new settlement.
The county government which is the custodian of the community land and with goodwill of the host community first provided the required land after it together with national government and development partners committed to cultivate integration between refugees and host community.
Former Turkana Governor Josphat Nanok, now Kenya’s Deputy State House Comptroller, argued then that the settlement was to exploit the socio-economic impact of the presence of refugees on Turkana, who often attracted humanitarian support. He hoped those services will reach communities outside of the camps.
Authorities now say integration, rather than encampment, will help both sides of the fence. Integration was backed by 2017 study by the International Finance Corporation.
Titled Kakuma as a Marketplace, it established that Kakuma, consisting of more than 180,000 refugees and 60, 000 locals had an economy of $56 million (KSh7.2 billion) per year, based on household consumption.
The current Shirika Plan, a multi-year initiative aims to promote the socioeconomic inclusion of refugees in Kenya by transforming camps into integrated settlements for both refugees and asylum seekers. It favours people like Ms Chelia and Mr Ramadhan who don't have plans to go back home soon.
Governor Jeremiah Lomorukai says he supports the Plan, but as long as it does not exclude locals.
“Counties hosting refugees grapple with high poverty levels and their plight needs attention as well,” he told The EastAfrican.
“For a successful transition and integration, Shirika plan should involve these host communities in resource sharing, employment, among other benefits."" Mr Lomorukai said.
The governor was on June 20 (the World Refugee Day), part of a key stakeholders’ appraisal forum in Nairobi to formally adopt the plan as part of World Refugees Day commemoration that was also attended UNHCR Country Representative Caroline Van Buren, UN-Resident Coordinator Dr Stephen Jackson, Principal Secretary for State Department of Foreign Affairs Dr Korir Sing’oei and his Immigration and Citizenship counterpart Prof Julius Bitok.
They all pledged to support the Plan that will see current refugee camps in both Kakuma and Dadaab restructured into modern urban centers with requisite infrastructure to serve both the locals and the integrated refugees in phases between 2024-2031.
Giving an experience of Kalobeyei settlement camp, they said that the current state does not reflect the true essence of integration in terms of sharing resources, information and socio-economic opportunities.
There are other fears beyond economic issues, such as erosion of Turkana culture as refugees inject new ways of life into the County.
At the moment, shortage of rations has World Food Programme to stop a universal service to ‘needs-based’ support.
WFP’s Country Director in Kenya Lauren Landis said in June that in this approach, WFP will provide food assistance based on the food security and socio-economic status of each family.
""Currently, 650,000 refugees supported by WFP receive the same level of food assistance. Providing assistance according to levels of need ensures that the most vulnerable are prioritised based on available resources, while weaning the least vulnerable off humanitarian assistance and supporting them to become self-reliant instead,” WFP’s Country Director said.",2024-07-03

- Dish out money and goodies at the drop of a dime.
- Surround yourself with folks who love plundering and pillaging.
1. Be Mr. Moneybags or Lady Largesse. FYI; this step is for those who are making a debut into elective politics. If you're already loaded, skip this step.
Here’s the thing. You can’t jump into a crocodile-infested river without tons of meat. Not unless you want to be turned into minced meat. This means you must amass extraordinary amounts of wealth, by any means necessary. If folks come against you, refer to step 7(b).
2. Be philanthropic personified. Dish out money and goodies at the drop of a dime. Once you’re referred to as Mhesh or Kiongozi, you must make it rain. In this game, stinginess is akin to fumbling the bag.
If anyone tries to challenge your tactics, refer to step 8.
3. Be devious. Lie worse than the devil. Lie so brazenly you will make Satan - who is the father of lies - to complain to God that you're robbing him blind of his cheating cred. Lie about anything and everything. For instance, if you were born with a silver spoon in your mouth; swear that you've eaten with dirty hands since the day you dropped from the womb onto the dirt floor of your shack.
If anyone calls your bluff, refer to step 6.
4. Be business-minded. Elective politics is a big business. It's all about the bottom line. Which is why you must surround yourself with folks who love plundering and pillaging. Promise them they will get paid if they help you ascend to power.
Cut deals. And, while you're at it, be cutthroat and, literally, if need be, cut throats. If you're put to task about your tactics, refer to step 3.
5. Be creative. This means decoding the masses’ psyche and finding out what's ticking. Come up with catchy slogans and rallying calls, even if they're nonsensical. You’re good to go as long as the slogans resonate with your target audience.
If anyone puts you in a tight corner, refer to step 2.
6. Be an “open book”. Duh. This is a facade to fool gullible folks. You must give the impression that you're easily accessible. Dish your phone number to the public. Eat with peasants in their dingy joints.
Being an open book also means wearing your heart on your sleeves. Again, of course, this isn't your real ticker. You're an unfeeling moron. But, for the sake of optics and the prize, hide your fangs and show your teeth.
If anyone questions your moves, refer to step 3.
7. (a) Be a super-duper schemer. (b) Have a solid and sold out tribal base. Use the old divide-and-rule trick. Never fails to work. Divide people along class lines, or tribes or whatever is convenient.
If anyone puts you to task, refer to step 9.
8. Be the high priest of hypocrites. It’s all about false pretences. Put church folks in your back pocket. Ditto other religious segments of society whom you feel hold the swing vote.
If you're cornered and asked to declare your stand, refer to step 3.
9. Be a chameleon. Any time you feel the need to advance your cause, be steps ahead of rivals or you sense waves and winds are shifting, change accordingly.
If you’re put in a tight spot, refer to step 7(a).
10. Be tenacious. If you’re unsuccessful, start back at one. Or, if you've done step 1, skip it and start wherever.
This is a politically-proven process. Trust it. Wherever you restart from, the chips will, eventually, all fall into place. That is, if it's not hacked.
Here's the hack. Hold 1 to account. Conscientiously decline 2. Denounce 3. Oppose 4. Deconstruct 5. Don't fall for 6. Stand, in totality, against 7. Call out 8. Unfollow 9. Fail 10 at the ballot. 10 out of 10 times.",2024-07-02
https://nation.africa/kenya/life-and-style/dn2/dear-kitoto-how-do-i-forgive-my-abusive-stepdad--4676670,"Hi Pastor,
My step dad married my biological mum when I was seven years old. He came from a marriage that lasted a decade before the wife left him. He was left with two daughters from that marriage.
A year ago, my step dad started being violent. He started insulting my mum and beating her. This abuse was also meted out to us.
Although I am older now, I am still hurt from watching my mum being abused. Recently my step dad was jailed for reasons unknown and my mum goes to visit him.
I wouldn’t say I like that she is choosing to stay in touch with her abusive husband. My heart is filled with pain and bitterness.
Hi,
While you were young, there was nothing you could have done to stop the violence against your mother. Your step dad is a man who has made bad choices in life.
Sadly, his behaviour has landed him in jail-even though we may not know under what circumstances.
Hate and anger will only breed fear and resentment that is equally deadly. At times a carrier of hate and anger like yourself can end up with a messy future in comparison to the abuser.
If not healed, a person carrying anger can easily release aggression on other innocent people.
Now that you are in a different environment, you must make the right choices. You or your siblings do not need to rush into judging your mother for visiting without properly understanding why she is doing so.
Today, you can make a choice that would redefine your worldview on life and family. This will help you chart a new path to healthy relations. You don’t have to make the same mistakes as your abusive step-dad did.
To move forward, you must deal with this past decisively. Your step-dad made choices that he will always be responsible for. There is a need for a recognition that you’re his abuse has no place in your future. Therefore, you have to disconnect yourself from it.
Embrace forgiveness
You are grown up now and able to decide what to do with the abuse you experienced as you map out the kind of future you want to have.
Ahead of you is the choice to allow hate to fester inside of you or to look for ways of getting rid of it. If not, the negative feelings that you have now can most likely lead you on a self-destructive path.
Embracing forgiveness is the best choice to help you let go of the wrong and the pain without expecting anything in return. This will help you offload the weight on your heart and mind.
Don’t let hate lead you to worse actions in the future. What you carry is evidence of a strong emotion resulting from the past and that can only be dealt by letting go and exercising forgiveness.
If not, this will act like a slow poison in your mind and body that has the ability to pollute your heart, soul and finally destroy you.
Unresolved hate could easily inflict pain in others unintentionally. If you can’t do it, talking about your feeling with responsible people who are professionals will help relieve the inner pressure that you feel.
Second, the way you deal with the hate and anger that you have is essential. To deal with this past may need to go beyond an act of saying “I forgive you.” Forgiveness must be voluntary from your side.
Positive thoughts
However, you should not assume that forgiveness will automatically be dual way. On you part, forgiveness will help you start on the process of offloading the past.
On the other hand, your future will be build more on rebuilding your life by establishing new thought patterns and behaviour.
So, start by forgiving self against any inner accusations. Move on then to forgive those who hurt you and your family. Learn then, how to develop positive thoughts that will be essential for lasting healing.
The truth is, you have the ability to control the feeling of anger and hate that you have instead of choosing blame. No one can forgive our aggressors on our behalf.
Trust will happen as you seek to build positive thoughts towards your life and step-dad.
Mother Theresa notes that, “People are often unreasonable, irrational, and self-centred. Forgive them anyway. If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish, ulterior motives. Be kind anyway.
What you spend years creating, others could destroy overnight. Create it anyway. The good you do today, will often be forgotten. Do good anyway. In the final analysis it is between you and God. It was never between you and them anyway.”",2024-07-02
https://nation.africa/kenya/life-and-style/dn2/gen-zs-intolerance-of-status-quo-is-admirable-4676672,"What you need to know:
- Gen Zs' gamophobia — a fear of commitment or fear of marriage – is rooted in their experiences.
- Gen Z are peacemakers who want issues laid out on the table and not swept under the carpet.
If you are a parent of a Gen Z, you must have felt the same shock, fear, and wonder in the last weeks when the mostly forlorn, gadget-invested child-adult in your house suddenly turned vocal and revolutionary.
Usually, they sleep in and only wake up because you shouted and threatened that you would not pay for the Wi-Fi in the next three months. They think we are dinosaurs walking around in our ignorant bliss.
Guess what? They are right. Finding mine already awake at dawn, dressed in boots, hut, bandana, and water in hand caught me by surprise.
“Are you off for a walk?”
She knew I would say no, which I did when she responded with, “I am going to town.”
What!
“CBD? There are demos today.”
She took a deep breath.
“Yeah, I know. That is why I am going there.”
Culture of Mubaba
My pleading, threatening, reasoning fell on deaf ears. I spent the day stressing and when she showed up in the evening, hoarse-voiced, I realised how proud I was of her, though she would have to read this to know this.
She won’t.
Gen Z has taught us many lessons and made us realise that we failed them, but we raised them right in other ways. They were clear that they only fear marriage.
Why? I posed this question to a group of them.
“It is a punitive, exploitative relationship. A life sentence.” This is the generation that has found the culture of Mpango, Mubaba, and Mumama entrenched in our moral decadence. Immorality and adultery have become normalised.
They do not want to be part of that charade. If the relationship is not honest, or open, no societal pressure will pin them down into a marriage.
Gen Z looks at us with disdain and is disgusted by our double standards and the facades we put up to the world. They question religiosity but are deeply sold into spirituality.
Fear of marriage
They read, learn, and engage with so much content in their virtual world of gadgets that on the occasional moment when they talk, we mostly ask, “Wow! How did you know that?”
“That’s how the universe works.” They say in response.
Gen Z’s gamophobia — a fear of commitment or fear of marriage – is rooted in their experiences. They have watched and experienced our bad-mannered treatment of each other, as spouses. They are not peacekeepers, these Gen Z. They will not take abuse in silence.
They will not walk on eggshells, like we do, for the sake of peace. They ruffle the feathers, heck, they pluck them off. Gen Z are peacemakers who want issues laid out on the table and not swept under the carpet. Difficult conversations fire them up.
One told me how their parents are quick to apologise, to evade discussing a painful or serious issue.
“But apologising is a healthy thing to do,” I said, perplexed. “Not unless one is sorry. When they say, I am sorry, I did this and that, and I know it hurt you.”
They have taught us that sincerity when apologising means you own up, take accountability and acknowledge the damage we cause by our behaviour.
Tribal and gender biases
When their fear of marriage is addressed, they will make better spouses than any other past generation. They know stuff about mental wellness that would shock psychiatrists.
They are not averse to therapy and healing, like many of their parents who walk around wounding others with untreated traumas. Gen Z is not fraught with the tribal and gender biases and prejudices that so deeply hamper us.
They will cause a revolution. They will not tolerate cultural norms that harm one gender over the other. The dowry die-hards? Your time is limited unless you can give a compelling case for exchanging a Gen Z girl with a cow.
They will - as we have witnessed - make it extremely difficult and shameful to squander public resources. Gen Z is not in the least impressed by exhibitionists, more so if one has not invented a world-changing innovation to explain a sudden source of wealth.
They do not want handouts. They make no sycophants. They want to work and earn their keep. We raised them right, by not driving fear into them, as happened with us.
They did not meet corporal punishments that raised us to be people easily intimated and cowed. They are intolerant of the status quo. Gen Z will teach us some more, and we need to listen to them. We will be better partners, better citizens, better leaders.",2024-07-03
https://nation.africa/kenya/life-and-style/dn2/octane-ratings-from-the-beach-to-the-mountaintop-4676710,"What you need to know:
- Irrespective of octane ratings, engines do also lose power at higher altitudes.
- Kenya’s fuel supply target is an octane rating of 93, in most places most of the time.
Does altitude have any effect on the grade of fuel your car likes or needs? - Clementina.
Short answer: Yes. Your engine will prefer (and might need) a slightly higher octane rating at the coast than in Nairobi or Timau. But most cars will work well enough with the same fuel at both low and high altitude.
Irrespective of octane ratings, engines do also lose power at higher altitudes.
Longer answer: The octane rating your car needs is determined first of all by its engine’s compression ratio. You can look that up in your particular car’s handbook. It is likely to be somewhere between 8.5 and 10.0 in most petrol engines.
As a crude rule of thumb, at sea level (say, 0 to 1,000 metres) the optimal octane rating should be the same number… without the decimal point. Compression 9.5. Octane rating 95.
Kenya’s fuel supply target is an octane rating of 93, in most places most of the time. This can vary slightly at source, or during transit and storage, but is estimated to always be somewhere between 91 and 95. Engines have quite a lot of tolerance for such variations, and any difference is unlikely to be noticeable on most cars.
The global target is a minimum of 91. Most cars can run adequately (though not optimally) on that. Many countries offer a range of options in petrol stations, with the lowest price at 91 and the most expensive at 97 or 99. Avgas (an aviation petrol for light aircraft) is about 101 and is also warranted by a few very high performance sports cars.
Compression ratios
So if your compression ratio is less than 9.3, relax. If the octane rating is higher than the compression ratio, it will do no harm and not affect performance (up or down). It will simply be more expensive than strictly necessary for your engine to perform properly.
If the octane rating is substantially lower than the compression, performance could be affected…in both vroom-vroom and fuel economy. In extreme cases the engine might start to “knock” and acceleration will be muted or erratic (splutter or lurching). If there is no sign of that, keep on keeping on with peace of mind.
For a lot of complex atmospheric and techno-chemical reasons, at altitudes well above sea level your engine can run well on a slightly lower octane rating, because the air is “thinner” – less dense – which, though the actual compression “ratio” remains unchanged, has the same effect as a slightly lower compression ratio.
It will also lose some power, no matter what fuel you use. The rule-of-thumb is about 10% for every 1,000 metres of climb. Nairobi is about 1,700 metres above Mombasa.
The hilltops on either side of the Rift Valley are between 2,000 and 3,000 metres. At above 4,000 metres, your engine power will be seriously reduced and even a gentle slope will be a struggle.
At 5,000 metres it might still run, but with only just enough power to peel a banana. That’s why light aircraft start with very high compression ratios and octane ratings…and have limited operational “ceilings”. That’s the layman’s version, anyway.
Progressive loss of power
Remember, too, that not all of an engine’s power output reaches the wheels. Up to 20 per cent is absorbed by the power train between the engine and the wheels, , and charging the battery (running all the electricals), and other things. Air conditioners impose a major draw.
Bottom line, if you drive from Mombasa to Eldoret a progressive loss of power is inevitable, not a fuel quality problem. Carry on. If you drive the other way, power will progressively increase, but again the same fuel will do the job.
On single trips between the coast and the highlands, most engines will have plenty of built-in tolerance to cope with these changes.
But if you are moving from long-term residence in the highlands to long-term residence at the coast (or vice versa) it is worth having your ignition timing adjusted.
This doesn’t remove the effect of altitude change, but helps compensate for it. “Timing” is a precise but not an absolute setting. It can be “advanced” or “retarded” (fractionally) to optimise performance for different conditions and usage patterns.
Too advanced can cause overheating, and too retarded disrupts combustion and wastes unburnt fuel. In advanced engine management systems, some have computerised sensors and control units that can make the adjustments automatically.",2024-07-02

- Self-care is wholesome involving physical, mental, spiritual and emotional health.
- It involves eating right, getting enough rest, and reading the right kind of books and content.
Do you practice self-care? No, we are not referring to your younger self who indulged in spa treatments or rocked well-toned abs earned through sweat and tears — literally — at the peak of your 20s.
We are talking about self-care at your present age. As a bills-paying, child(ren) raising, parent.
The Oxford Dictionary defines self-care as, “the practice of activities that are necessary to sustain life and health, normally initiated and carried out by the individual for him- or herself.”
Self-care is wholesome involving physical, mental, spiritual and emotional health. It doesn’t stop at looking and smelling good, although this is important too.
It involves eating right, getting enough rest, and reading the right kind of books and content (with positive vibrations).
Spiritually, a person can practice their faith through prayers, attending church services or reading spiritual texts as well as spending time in nature to connect with the environment and reflect.
Additionally, for emotional self-care, one can practice meditation, and journal their thoughts and feelings to process their emotions or could seek therapy and counselling to help address their emotional issues.
One can also practice social self-care where they spend time with family and friends or engage in activities that bring joy and relaxation such as traveling, painting, cooking or gardening.
In Kenya, self-care continues to be a growing trend. In a 2023 Kenya National Bureau of Statistics report, it was found that men spent more time and money on self-care than women.
It was found that men spent 710 minutes daily on self-care while women only spent 704.6 minutes. Men were found to spend more time on culture, leisure, mass media and sports activities compared to women.
But then, self-care costs money.
In January 2023, the beauty products and services industry in Kenya was valued at over Sh20 billion while in December of the same year, Statista Market Insights projected that the mental health market in Kenya would reach (Sh4,356,667,700) in 2024 as people treated mental health issues.
A 2024 Economic Impact Research finding released by the World Travel and Tourism Council estimated that the sector’s contribution could go as high as Sh1.45 trillion this year.
This means Kenyans have been spending millions of shillings on various forms of self-care.
But with the current harsh economic climate- recently greatly impacted by the raft of government-introduced taxes and steeper policies looming, self-care practices have been significantly impacted, forcing many to either make sacrifices or seek cost-effective alternatives due to tighter budgets occasioned by the high cost of living.
“I often indulged in getting massages when I went in for my weekly hair shave. I work online so spending hours hunched over a computer often gets me tired and with body aches- especially my back. I used to pay Sh1,500 for the back massage only and once a month, I did a full body massage for Sh1,700 which was inclusive of the hair shave. But with the current times, I have had to cut down on the frequency of massages. I get a hair shave plus a facial once every three weeks. That is Sh200 for the shave and Sh150 for the facial,” said Abdikarim Hussein, a resident of Komarock in Nairobi.
He revealed his wife now massages him at home because it has become too expensive to pay for the service at a commercial store.
“The money I now save is used to pay for bills such as transport and hospital visits for my family. I also pay more for stable internet because I work online and I provide for my family's basic needs- which are no longer basic but critical in these harsh economic times. Today, self-care is not as paramount for me as it used to be.""
Ms Lydia Mandela, a mum of two, a seven-year-old girl and a two-year-old boy reminisces about when she would spend money dining out, getting beauty treatments and going for vacations without a flinch.
“I used to spend about Sh10000 monthly on self-care and the largest portion of my budget went to beauty services. However, due to the current strained economic times, I have had to find more affordable ways to access self-care. When eating out, I am now keen on restaurant prices. I still go on vacation but less frequently and the budget for this has decreased.”
She noted that her visits to beauty salons have reduced significantly.
“I have found myself cutting back on the budget for my self-care routines to cater for more important home bills such as electricity, drinking water, and food. I now focus more on home-cooked meals and snacks for my family. I don't buy toys for my children as often as I used to or take them out on fun days. The frequency of my self-care routine has reduced but the quality I go for remains the same.”
For Nyambura Sam, a mum of a four-year-old boy, hacking self-care on a budget has been a balancing act that has tested her restraint and self-discipline. Thankfully, her beauty and social standards continue to thrive despite harsh economic times.
“Once or twice a month I go for pedicures and manicures, twice a weekend, I go out. At the nail salon, I spend about Sh1,800 for both services and hair. Because I have dreadlocks, I spend Sh1,200 for retouching and an extra Sh500 for dye. When going out, my budget wouldn't be over Sh5,000- I make sure not to carry my cards and I have money in my mobile transaction applications inclusive of transport.”
Nyambura says her dreadlocks are a big financial save for her, especially since she has been going to the same salon for more than six years thus securing ‘customer’ rates.
For Collins Juma, the harsh economic climate has limited his social circles to maintain certain minimums like going out and having fun. According to him, it is cheaper to maintain old friends than meet new ones which is often occasioned by the nature of his job in the entertainment industry.
“I enjoy networking with friends at least twice a week. During these meet-ups, we cost share on buying lunch and drinks. I would spend up to Sh3,000 a week. Again, when I feel bored, I would participate in sports activities such as playing football, cycling, and swimming. Except for playing football, all the other activities cost me Sh1500 for swimming thrice a week and Sh1,200 to rent a bike for three hours a day, four times a week,” began Juma.
To save on costs, Juma decided to limit the number of meet-ups and activities. However, this compromise comes at a cost…
“One time, someone commented about how big I have become ‘because I am eating well’ when all along, it is because I can’t maintain the sporty activities that kept me lean. They’ve become too expensive. That comment did not go down well with me. My budget is not great right now but I do some gym exercises in the house.”
Sam Luhazo the owner of a nail beauty parlour in Nairobi’s Donholm area has noted with concern that his clients- majorly women- cut back on manicures, pedicures and facial services over the past few months.
“Before things changed, you would find a client coming in thrice a month and parting with almost Sh4,000 per visit for a session that would last up to two hours. Today, things have changed and some come in once a month or even skip; and they no longer pay for the services they used to.
""You'd find they are now opting for a manicure only because their toes would not be visible in their shoes. It’s not because they don't want to, it's because they are financially strained and choose to do one service at a time.
""In a month I used to earn a profit of Sh60,000 and now, we are ranging between Sh25,000 and Sh30,000- making rent payment a bit of a hassle because the profits are lower.”
He went on to note that non-pedicured toes are now being hidden in closed shoes and many women are no longer getting fancy acrylic nails, overlays and gum gel but opting for simple gel applications and stick-on nails. They also no longer do full hot bath foot spa pedicures but go for half pedicures.
Lillian Mutanu, a city-based nutritionist and dietician, charges her clients between Sh3,000 and Sh10,000 for customised diet plans. With the rising cost of living, Mutanu’s revolving door is a thing of the past.
Since the year began, the number of clients has dwindled. Her services have now become a luxury, especially since most insurance companies do not cover her services and products.
She observes that it’s not just her business that is failing but more importantly, the health of people is being affected by the harsh economic times.
“Currently, the most affordable food we have is carbohydrates. Eggs, meats, fish, some fruits and cereals are not cheap and not every family can afford them. This can lead to under-consumption of certain nutrients and cause deficiencies.”
Due to the altered dietary habits occasioned by limited budgets, people, in Ms Mutanu’s experience, are prone to have their self-image and confidence impacted in one way or another.
“Of course with overconsumption of certain macronutrients and under-consumption of others, there is going to be a lot of nutritional imbalances when it comes to intake utilisation, uptake and output. So these people will have altered metabolic functions, energy release and production, hormonal function and this will affect things like fertility and other complications that come with malnutrition.
""You are going to have individuals suffering from side effects such as blood sugar regulation that causes a lot of weight gain in the past they used to say gaining weight is a problem for the rich but unfortunately we have a good number of people financially struggling with being overweight.
""Other side effects will be hormonal acne, dry skin, brittle nails and hair, hair loss and dry lips which will affect someone’s confidence because it is related to one’s self-image.
""Many women rely on their outer appearance to feel the best and confident so you can imagine if they are bombarded with malnutrition symptoms that affect their self-image negatively. They will have it very hard.”
Audrey Oluyole, a counselling psychologist notes that people’s ability to afford self-care products and services can significantly impact self-image and confidence in several ways.
“When one cannot maintain their usual beauty regiments, fitness routines, or grooming habits due to financial constraints, they may feel less attractive or presentable, leading to decreased self-esteem.
""People may compare themselves unfavourably to others who can afford to maintain their self-care routines, further lowering their self-worth. Regular self-care practices often contribute to a sense of routine and normalcy.
""The inability to engage in these practices can lead to feelings of inadequacy and a diminished sense of identity. Financial stress can have a profound impact on mental health, self-esteem, and self-image. The constant worry about financial stability can lead to increased anxiety and depression, which in turn affects how individuals view themselves.”
She went on,” Financial struggles can lead to feelings of failure and helplessness, damaging self-esteem and self-image, as people may equate financial success with personal worth.
""Social media and societal expectations, additionally, play a significant role in shaping self-care practices and possessions of self-worth. It often showcases idealised lifestyles and self-care routines that can set unrealistic standards.
""During economic downturns, individuals may feel pressure to keep up with these standards despite financial limitations because seeing peers who appear unaffected by financial hardships can exacerbate feelings of inadequacy and failure among those struggling financially.”
But there is hope for those who cannot maintain their preferred self-care routines. According to Ms Oluyole, such individuals can turn to home-based self-care alternatives.
“Some of the coping mechanisms and alternative self-care strategies for maintaining mental health and self-esteem during economic difficulties include home-based self-care, which encourages practices such as home workouts, DIY beauty treatments and mindful exercises that do not require significant financial investment.
""Secondly, utilising low-cost community resources like public parks for exercises, local support groups and mental health services offered by non-profits can also help. The third one is skill development. Engaging in hobbies or learning new skills such as cooking, baking and content creation can be fulfilling and improve self-esteem without high costs.
""Relying on family and friends for emotional support and shared activities that foster a sense of belonging and reduce feelings of isolation can also be one of the coping mechanisms an individual can use. This is because prolonged financial stress and significant alterations of self-care routines can have several long-term psychological effects.
""One is chronic stress, which is brought by ongoing financial pressure that can lead to one feeling inadequate, which impacts overall mental and physical health.”
Bottom line? Do not forsake self-care dear parent. Put it right there with your list of bills to pay because in the end, your body—and family eventually-- will thank you for it. Cut back, make compromises and do all it takes to take good care of yourself.",2024-07-02
https://nation.africa/kenya/news/africa/-why-somalia-won-t-offer-dialogue-to-militants--4677436,"Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud came to power two years ago with the intent to create a country at “peace with itself and the world.” One of the goals was to beat down the militant group al-Shabaab.
So when word went around last week that authorities were offering an olive branch to the al-Qaeda-linked group, it caused both hope and fear. Hope because it may be cheaper to upend the insecurity in Somalia without spilling more blood.
But fear because all that could change the collaboration Mohamud’s government has built between national security forces and volunteer vigilante groups eager to target a common enemy.
Dr Adam Aw Hirsi from the Mogadishu-based think-tank Foresight for Practical Solutions argued any dialogue offer to Shabaabs could place the government’s stance against militants into question.
“First and foremost, the mere suggestion of engaging in discussions with a group responsible for numerous bloody atrocities and heinous violence, with which some Somali clans swore to fight to the last man, raises significant moral and ethical questions,” Dr Aw Hirsi told The EastAfrican.
As part of the campaign against al-Shabaab, Mohamud even labelled al-Shabaab as outcasts, choosing to describe their brand of Islam as deviant. Many people bought the strategy to depict the group as not representative of Somali youth.
“The Somali communities who have borne the brunt of al-Shabaab’s terror may feel betrayed and confused by the prospect of Somali government conducting secretive and unilateral dialogue with their sworn enemies,” Aw Hirsi argued on Monday, July 1.
Except now the government says no such talks will take place, as long as the militants keep carrying arms and launching ambush attacks.
At the ceremony to commemorate Independence Day on July 1, President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud dismissed “misleading information” on the war on al-Shabaab.
“There is no single issue that we can discuss with Al-Shabaab. This is contrary to what has recently been circulating in the social media,” he told an audience in Mogadishu.
But he didn’t entirely shut the door on dialogue. According to him, the government may hold discussions with the group on two conditions:
• If foreign fighters get out of Somalia
• If local fighters surrender and show a willingness to rejoin their communities
“Let me say that many had deserted the extremist group, abandoned the idea and are now serving their nation in various capacities, security and civil service, some reaching high ranks.
“We can only negotiate with Al-Shabaab if there are commonalities and we only differ on how to do things, ‘I prefer this and I prefer that’, kind of thing.”
Although Somalia has developed a full-blown war on al-Shabaab, it has also pursued a behaviour-change mindset; asking banks and financial institutions in general to freeze funding channels, asking the diaspora to stop sending money to fighters and asking villagers to out sympathisers of al-Shabaab. Those who change their ways have been rewarded.
Somali Prime Minister Hamza Barre, for instance, named Mukhtar Rubow, a former Shabaab spokesman as Minister for Religious Affairs. However, Rubow had quit the militant group six years ago in search of a formal political career.
The rumour about talks with al-Shabaab didn’t start today but no one had ever verified claims, although the grapevine suggested some countries friendly to Somalia had suggested this route because military means won’t defeat an ideology.
In late June, President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud travelled to Norway, where he spoke at the Oslo Forum, a yearly gathering of leaders, conflict mediators, and other actors.
The theme was “Mediation Against All Odds.”
“The President touched on the government’s commitment to pursuing peaceful means to reduce extremist violence, including initiating political engagements and providing amnesty to members who denounce extremist ideology. He further noted that “the terrorists’ global agenda complicates these efforts,” said a dispatch from Villa Somalia, his official residence in Mogadishu.
During Mohamud’s tour in the Nordic country, he spoke at various venues including one in which Qatar’s state minister for foreign affairs Mohamed Bin Abdul Aziz Al Khulaifi was a panel member.
Al Khulaifi responded to an enquiry about possible mediation “(being) a Somalia’s internal security matters and this is where international stakeholders can add value by helping, assessing and enhancing those aspects together.
“I strongly believe more international cooperation in dealing, specifically in the case of Somalia, will assist and bring more peace and stability in this area.”
Al Khulaifi’s remarks prompted inquiries about the Gulf State’s ability to lure the Federal Government of Somalia and Al-Shabaab to peace talks.
Mohamud’s trip to Norway was met with multiple criticisms as many saw participation in a forum focusing on dialogue being a signal of his readiness to talk with the enemy.
Abdurahman Abdishakur, a local legislator and a former presidential candidate in 2022, suggested such dialogue should be a careful step.
“The talks that are said to be held with the Al-Shabaab terrorist group should not be an arbitrary decision. It should be approached through an inclusive national consultation, and the public should be informed transparently,” Abdishakur said.
Somali government officials have since rejected the grapevine. National Security Adviser Hussein Sheikh-Ali said that President Mohamud has put in place unblemished conditions for any potential negotiations.
“They must cut any links with global terror groups and accept Somalia’s territorial integrity. They must be prepared to peacefully pursue their political agenda,” Sheikh-Ali stated.
On Saturday, speaking at the inauguration of Somaliland’s new museum built in Hargeisa, President Muse Bihi of the breakaway region of Somaliland, claimed Mogadishu is negotiating with Al-Shabaab to create an alliance that will target his region.
It is not the first time Somaliland authority has suggested facing an alliance that includes al-Shabaab.
A clan militia forced Somaliland troops from Las Anod town, Sool region, about 1200 northeast of Mogadishu, in August 2023. They then established SSC-Khatumo administration which has since been endorsed by Mogadishu as a region directly administered by the Federal Government of Somalia. Somaliland which protested the move claims the militia were aided by Shabaabs, which the clans rejected.
Many experts reckon that with Al-Shabaab now plagued by internal rifts, more radical elements within the group oppose any such negotiations.
Prime Minister Hamza Barre had earlier declared his government’s inclination to initiate peace talks with Al-Shabaab in February this year.
“I express our willingness to negotiate if the group renounces violence,” Barre had stated.
Known formally as Harakat Al-Shabaab Al-Mujahideen (Youth Jihadist Movement), the militants have been fighting for nearly two decades to destroy the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) and rid the country of foreign forces that are assisting the FGS and rule the country by strict Islamic rule.
Now Somalia must stabilise its security forces as the African Union Transition Mission (ATMIS) in Somalia prepare to leave Somalia later this year. Somalia and neighbouring countries had agreed on a post-ATMIS force but finer details including mandate are yet to be ironed out.

https://nation.africa/kenya/news/africa/the-imf-is-failing-countries-like-kenya-4677556,"The recent Kenyan protests are a warning that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is failing. The public does not think it is helping its member countries manage their economic and financial problems, which are being exacerbated by a rapidly changing global political economy.
To be sure, the IMF is not the only cause of Kenya’s problems with raising the funds to meet its substantial debt obligations and deal with its budget deficit. Other causes include the failure of the governing class to deal with corruption, to spend public finances responsibly and to manage an economy that produces jobs and improves the living standards of Kenya’s young population.
The country has also been hammered by drought, floods and locust infestations in recent years. In addition, its creditors are demanding that it continue servicing its large external debts despite its domestic challenges and a difficult international financial and economic environment.
The IMF has provided financial support to Kenya. But the financing is subject to tough conditions which suggest that debt obligations matter more than the needs of long-suffering citizens. This is despite the IMF claiming that its mandate now includes helping states deal with issues like climate, digitalisation, gender, governance and inequality.
Unfortunately, Kenya is not an isolated case. Twenty-one African countries are receiving IMF support.
In Africa, debt service, on average, exceeds the combined amounts governments are spending on health, education, climate and social services.
The tough conditions attached to IMF financing have led the citizens of Kenya and other African countries to conclude that a too-powerful IMF is the cause of their problems. However, my research into the law, politics and history of the international financial institutions suggests the opposite: the real problem is the IMF’s decline in authority and efficacy.
Some history will help explain this and indicate a partial solution.
The history
When the treaty establishing the IMF was negotiated 80 years ago, it was expected to have resources equal to roughly 3% of global GDP. This was to help deal with the monetary and balance of payments problems of 44 countries. Today, the IMF is expected to help its 191 member countries deal with fiscal, monetary, financial and foreign exchange problems and with “new” issues like climate, gender and inequality.
To fulfil these responsibilities, its member states have provided the IMF with resources equal to only about 1% of global GDP.
The decline in its resources relative to the size of the global economy and of its membership has at least two pernicious effects.
The first is that it is providing its member states with less financial support than they require if they are to meet the needs of their citizens and comply with their legal commitments to creditors and citizens. The result is that the IMF remains a purveyor of austerity policies. It requires a country to make deeper spending cuts than would be needed if the IMF had adequate resources.
The second effect of declining resources is that it weakens the IMF’s bargaining position in managing sovereign debt crises. This is important because the IMF plays a critical role in such crises. It helps determine when a country needs debt relief or forgiveness, how big the gap between the country’s financial obligations and available resources is, how much the IMF will contribute to filling this gap and how much its other creditors must contribute.
When Mexico announced that it could not meet its debt obligations in 1982, the IMF stated that it would provide about a third of the money that Mexico needed to meet its obligations, provided its commercial creditors contributed the remaining funds. It was able to push the creditors to reach an agreement with Mexico within months. It had sufficient resources to repeat the exercise in other developing countries in Latin America and Eastern Europe.
The conditions that the IMF imposed on Mexico and the other debtor countries in return for this financial support created serious problems for these countries. Still, the IMF was an effective actor in the 1980s debt crisis.
Today, the IMF is unable to play such a decisive role. For example, it has provided Zambia with less than 10% of its financing needs. It has been four years since Zambia defaulted on its debt and, even with IMF support, it has not yet concluded restructuring agreements with all its creditors.
What is to be done?
The solution to this problem requires the rich countries to provide sufficient finances for the IMF to carry out its mandate. They must also surrender some control and make the organisation more democratic and accountable.
In the short term, the IMF can take two actions.
First, it must set out detailed policies and procedures that explain to its own staff, to its member states and to the inhabitants of these states what it can and will do. These policies should clarify the criteria that the IMF will use to determine when and how to incorporate climate, gender, inequality and other social issues into IMF operations.
They should also describe with whom it will consult, how external actors can engage with the IMF and the process it will follow in designing and implementing its operations. In fact, there are international norms and standards that the IMF can use to develop policies and procedures that are principled and transparent.
Second, the IMF must acknowledge that the issues raised by its expanded mandate are complex and that the risk of mistakes is high.
Consequently, the IMF needs a mechanism that can help it identify its mistakes, address their adverse impacts in a timely manner and avoid repeating them.
In short, the IMF must create an independent accountability mechanism such as an external ombudsman who can receive complaints.
Currently, the IMF is the only multilateral financial institution without such a mechanism. It therefore lacks the means for identifying unanticipated problems in its operations when they can still be corrected and for learning about the impact of its operations on the communities and people it is supposed to be helping.",2024-07-03
https://nation.africa/kenya/news/africa/women-children-trapped-at-church-in-sudan-s-capital-endure-hunger-bombardment-4677582,"Trapped in a Catholic mission sheltering dozens of women and children from the war raging on the streets of Khartoum, Father Jacob Thelekkadan punched new holes in his belt as the supplies of food dwindled and he grew thinner.
Around 80 people are taking refuge inside the Dar Mariam mission, a Catholic church and school compound in Khartoum's al-Shajara district, caught in the crossfire between Sudan's army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), according to accounts by the priest and seven other people at the mission.
The roof of the main building has been damaged by shells, and parts of the nuns' quarters have been set ablaze. Holes caused by stray bullets mark the mission's walls.
As food has grown scarce, the nuns have boiled tree leaves for the children to eat and many of the adults have skipped meals.
A Red Cross effort to rescue them in December ended with two dead and seven others wounded, including three of the charity's staff, after gunmen opened fire on the convoy, forcing it to turn back before it could reach the mission. The warring sides traded blame for the attack.
Thelekkadan said he and the nuns had refused offers from the army to ferry them out across the river permanently, leaving the families behind.
""When the road is safe, we will be the first to leave, but with the people,"" said Thelekkadan, a 69-year-old Indian national.
Many of the inhabitants of Sudan's capital fled after the conflict erupted in April last year, enveloping Khartoum and its sister cities of Bahri and Omdurman along the Nile, and quickly spreading to other parts of the country.
At the start of the war, the RSF occupied strategic sites and residential neighbourhoods in Khartoum, positioning snipers on high-rise buildings. The army, lacking effective ground forces, responded with heavy artillery and air strikes.
The Dar Mariam mission became a safe haven for those lacking the money to flee or without anywhere to go.
Photos shared with Reuters by Thelekkadan show parts of the mission's buildings littered with debris, walls heavily damaged by bullets or shelling, and rooms and corridors blackened by smoke.
""Our food situation became very bad,"" said Thelekkadan. ""We're all very weak.""
Extreme hunger has spread across Sudan in areas worst affected by the conflict, prompting famine warnings for areas including in Khartoum.
10 million displaced
Some families took shelter at the mission in June last year, hoping for protection from its concrete roof. But the area soon became cut off as the RSF pressed to capture the strategic Armoured Corps camp about 2 km away, one of several military bases it was targeting, Thelekkadan said.
Al-Shajara district has come under heavy attack by the RSF. Those living nearby with the money to do so have registered with the military to be taken across the Nile; some have been waiting for months.
But a nighttime evacuation by boat across the White Nile is considered too risky for the children at the mission, Thelekkadan said.
Sudan's war has created the world's biggest internal displacement crisis and has driven nearly 10 million people to seek shelter inside or outside the country, according to the International Organization for Migration.
Reuters has documented how the fighting has triggered ethnically-charged killings in the western region of Darfur and led to the spread of deadly hunger.
The war has also caused unprecedented destruction in the capital, which was sheltered from modern Sudan's previous conflicts. Both warring factions have impeded the delivery of humanitarian relief, aid workers say, leaving civilians dependent on charity provided by groups of neighbourhood volunteers, among others.
An RSF media official said the paramilitary had tried to allow for the evacuation of the families by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), but the army had thwarted the effort and was using them as human shields.
An army spokesman said the families had been trapped by the war, and that troops from the Armoured Corps had done their duty by protecting and helping them, in line with army practice in other conflict-hit areas.
Numbers have fluctuated, but since March about 30 women along with 50 children aged 2-15 have stayed at the mission, according to Thelekkadan. His account was confirmed by two of the nuns, an administrator and four women sheltering at the mission, two other priests who have kept in touch with Dar Mariam, and an army intelligence officer responsible for churches in Khartoum.
Those staying at the mission are mostly Christian refugees from South Sudan and Ethiopia, who set up tents made from plastic sheeting around the compound's buildings, which include a church, a school and a residence.
When fighting starts nearby, they take cover inside the residence. Some poor Sudanese Muslim families have also sought temporary shelter at the mission.
Waiting for evacuation
The bombardments in November shredded an image of the Virgin Mary at the compound's entrance, ripped through the second floor of the main building, and set the roof on fire. Several people were lightly injured.
RSF snipers had the entrance to Dar Mariam in their sights. A boy from the neighbourhood was killed when mortar shrapnel sliced into his head after he had helped carve out an exit at the back of the compound to avoid sniper fire, Thelekkadan said.
The mission's residents had been trying to survive ""a lot of shooting and bombing,"" sister Miriam, one of the nuns, told Reuters in a video call.
""We got used to it and we are not afraid. God is protecting us, but we are waiting for evacuation,"" she said.
Thelekkadan and the nuns turned their most secure room into a shelter to try to protect the children from the crossfire. They attempted to distract the children from the violence raging around them, creating a space to use bicycles in the yard and encouraging them to play video games.
""We tried to not make them feel like they are in a prison,"" Thelekkadan said.
In early January, the mission was caught in the crossfire again and rooms in the nuns' residence were set ablaze.
Food has been a challenge. By September, cash was running low, and collecting supplies from local markets became nearly impossible due to clashes.
The children have often received meagre servings of porridge, lentils and beans. But stocks dwindled.
Since February, troops stationed at the Armoured Corps camp have delivered some airdropped provisions to Dar Mariam, including sugar and fuel for generators used to draw water from wells, Thelekkadan said.
The army also provided a Starlink connection, allowing those at the mission to use their phones again. They flew the priest and an administrator twice to Port Sudan, a Red Sea city to which army and government offices have relocated, to meet church officials and collect some cash and supplies.
Sister Celestine, another of the nuns, said she is still gripped by fear each time bombardments shake the area.

- In Nairobi on Tuesday, traders armed themselves with wooden clubs and metal bars.
- In Eldoret, Uasin Gishu County real estate investors have hired additional private guards.
Business owners have stepped up security to protect their property in the wake of the anti-governmental protests that have rocked parts of the country.
Traders are counting losses that run into millions of shillings after their businesses were looted and others set ablaze in various towns.
In downtown Nairobi on Tuesday, traders armed themselves with wooden clubs and metal bars to protect their businesses from looters after the chaotic scenes of last week.
In Eldoret, Uasin Gishu County real estate investors have hired additional private guards to beef up security.
Initially, the anti-tax demos organised by Gen Zs were largely peaceful until they turned deadly; over 20 people have been shot dead, widespread damage of property and looting.
“There is increased demand for private guards who want to protect their property should there be chaos like last Tuesday,” said Joshua Too, a private security firm operator in Eldoret.
A spot check by Nation.Africa established that traders are not restocking their stores for fear of losing their goods to looters.
“I do not want a repeat of what occurred last week when I lost property worth millions of shillings to rowdy protesters,” said Amos Kamau, a trader in Eldoret.
The Kenya National Private Security Workers Union said private security guards complement the National Police Service by helping to enforce law and order during protests.
The union’s secretary-general and founder Isaac Andabwa said private guards should be trained on modern security techniques and be equipped with appropriate equipment to effectively deal with criminals.
“In as much as private guards are in demand, a lot of reforms need to be done. They need proper security skills and equipment to effectively protect lives and property,” said Mr Andabwa.
The police, military and other security personnel have been deployed to quell violence by protesters in major towns.
The protests escalated when members of the National Assembly voted in the favour of the controversial Finance Bill, 2024.
There was public outcry after lawmakers passed the Bill which sought to impose more taxes on Kenyans who are already suffering due to the high cost of living.
But President William Ruto declined to assent to the Bill and withdrew it.
Eldoret town has been the epicentre of the demonstrations in the North Rift region where four people were killed while scores of others sustained injuries during last week’s demonstrations.
Fifteen suspects appeared in an Eldoret court where they were charged with looting and destruction of property.
Two high-end nightclubs, restaurants, a municipal court, vehicles, the Kenya National Library and Geminia Insurance Company Ltd building were burnt after the protests turned chaotic in Eldoret.
The proprietor of HL Chemist and mobile phones store, Morgan Kipkoech, said he lost goods worth Sh10 million when rowdy protesters broke into his business premises and looted property.
Rugendo Bata store owner, David Wakaimba, 89, said he lost stock worth Sh100 million, while the owner of Baniyas Square Club and Restaurant lost over Sh40 million when thieves stole several TV sets, a public address system and assorted alcoholic drinks among other properties.
Security teams were on Tuesday deployed to strategic positions while anti-riot police patrolled in major towns to help prevent lawlessness by protesters.
In Eldoret, security was beefed up around the Uasin Gishu County headquarters after demonstrators stormed the grounds last week and set ablaze the municipal court and pelted offices with stones.",2024-07-03

- Learning resumed on Monday after the mid-term break last week.
- Pupils failed to turned up at Moi Avenue Primary School in Nairobi.
Many schools across the country remained closed on Tuesday as parents kept their children at home amid fears anti-government protests could turn violent.
While some schools sent messages to parents on Monday that they would remain closed, some opted not to take the children to school.
Many roads had less traffic than usual. Learning resumed on Monday after the mid-term break last week.
“Due to the planned demonstrations tomorrow Tuesday July 2, 2024, there will be no school as a precautionary measure. We shall resume classes on Wednesday July 3, 2024. The children have been sent home with extra work they can do under supervision,” reads one such message sent to parents.
“We are planning to have physical classes on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, then use the online platform on Tuesday and Thursday to cover more subjects. We would not want the children on harm's way,” another message from a school in Rongai read.
While pupils failed to turned up at Moi Avenue Primary School in downtown Nairobi, their teachers reported for duty.
The teachers later left as tension gripped the capital amid running street battles between police and the demonstrators.
“We weren’t asked not to take children to school but I couldn’t have allowed my children to come to school under such circumstances. Last week, the police officers were throwing the teargas canisters even inside the school compound,” Mr Chris Were, a parent at the school, told the Nation.
Jamhuri High School, which is in the Ngara neighbourhood and a walking distance from the city centre, had not reopened after students broke for half-term last Wednesday. Learning is expected to resume on Wednesday.
Only 10 out of 250 students showed up in the morning at St Brigid’s Public Primary School on General Waruingi Road in Pumwani. They were released to go home at 10am. The teachers were also allowed to leave.
“We didn’t tell the learners not to come. It’s the parents’ decision, which is good because we don’t have power to protect them in case their safety is compromised. We can’t punish learners for absenteeism under such circumstances,” a teacher at St Brigid’s told the Nation.
There were no learners at the adjacent Dr Aggrey Primary School and Muslim Primary School.
At 11:45am, the Nation found some parents at Muthaiga Primary School who had gone to take their children home. They said they feared that riots in Mathare could spill over to the school.
However, learning was going on in City Primary School in Ngara and Ainsworth Primary School on Muratina Street in Eastleigh.
In Homa Bay town, many learners did not report to school. A few who did carried packed lunch.
At Shauri Yako Primary School, the headteacher, Mr John Oguttu, said all teachers reported for duty and only a few learners did not show up.
The situation was the same at Lake Primary School. Schools that were to reopen today after the half-term break advised parents not to release their children due to safety concerns.
Parents with children at Ogande Girls were told via text message that the school will reopen on Wednesday.
“Please note that, due to planned nationwide demonstrations on Tuesday, our resumption date from half-term changes to Wednesday July 3, 2024,” the WhatsApp message said.
In Kisii town, the reopening date for learners at Kisii High School was pushed to Wednesday.
""The opening day from half-term has been moved to Wednesday July 3, 2024. Release the boys early enough,"" read a message from the school to parents.
Some parents failed to take their children to school fearing that the protests may intensity during the day.
Some learners were caught up in the protests after Hospital Road was blocked by protesters.
""Good morning team, you all know that our Form One and Four are reporting back tomorrow, the challenge is with Form Two and Three. Given the prevailing circumstances, I urge those who will manage to allow their girls to report tomorrow; we have no objection,"" read a message from Sironga Girls High School.
Some parents in Siaya town also did not release their children for fear of the nationwide protests. Most of town’s streets remained deserted while businesses were closed.
“Last week, one person was shot dead and that means the safety of my children is not guaranteed,” Mr John Ouma, a father of three, said.
Schools located in the rural areas went on with their lessons as usual; Wang Chieng Primary School in West Alego, Upanda Primary School and Palpal Primary School all had their programmes uninterrupted.

- Despite the normalisation of menstrual cycles, the pain associated with them often goes unacknowledged and unsupported in the workplace.
- Countries like Zambia in Africa and recently Spain have recognised the fundamental right of women to take paid time off during their menstrual cycle.
As I reflect on my journey through adolescence and into adulthood, one particular aspect stands out vividly—my struggle with menstrual pain.
Like many women, I've experienced excruciating discomfort during my menstrual cycle, pain so intense that it has affected my ability to work, to study, and even to simply function normally. This is a reality shared by countless women across Kenya and the world, yet it remains a topic shrouded in silence and stigma.
From my earliest memories of menstruation in school, where the pain was so severe that I had to miss days of classes, to my professional life where I've struggled to meet expectations during crucial projects, the impact of menstrual pain on my life has been profound.
Despite the normalisation of menstrual cycles, the pain associated with them often goes unacknowledged and unsupported in the workplace.
Imagine a workplace where women are empowered to take paid leave when they experience debilitating menstrual symptoms. This isn't just a dream; it's a reality in several progressive countries around the world.
Countries like Zambia in Africa and recently Spain have recognised the fundamental right of women to take paid time off during their menstrual cycle. Additionally, companies like Nike Japan and Go-Jek in Indonesia have implemented menstrual leave policies, recognising the need to accommodate their female employees' health needs.
In Taiwan and South Korea, some workplaces have similar provisions, acknowledging the importance of supporting women during their menstrual cycle.
Countries like Italy and Spain have gone further by enacting legislation that mandates paid menstrual leave. In Spain, women can take up to three days off per month for severe menstrual pain, a significant step towards recognising menstrual health as a legitimate concern in the workplace.
This isn't merely about granting a few days off; it's about acknowledging the unique health needs of women and ensuring their dignity and productivity are preserved.
Employers play a pivotal role in fostering an inclusive workplace environment that prioritises and supports the health and holistic well-being of their female workforce.
By implementing policies that include paid menstrual leave, companies not only support their employees' physical health but also contribute to a more equitable work environment.
Contrary to misconceptions, these policies do not undermine productivity; they enhance it by ensuring that women can manage their health effectively and return to work refreshed and focused.
Read: Spain: Female workers to get monthly menstrual leave
The benefits of menstrual leave extend beyond individual health. They contribute to a more open dialogue about menstruation, challenging age-old taboos and promoting a healthier work environment for all.
Studies from countries with menstrual leave policies show increased comfort and productivity among female employees, and a reduction in absenteeism due to menstrual-related issues.
Our policymakers, along with a significant section of society, often disregard menstrual-related disorders. Menstruation has historically been considered a private matter, shrouded in taboos and stereotypes, rather than being recognised as a critical health and social issue deserving public attention and policy intervention.
The Kenyan Public Service Commission, HR departments, and private employers should not ignore the humane gesture of implementing a menstrual leave policy. This allows women to bleed with dignity and peace without it affecting their work.
Every woman is different, and an option should be provided without judgment for women who need a few days off due to severe menstrual pains. We should learn from the story of Njambi Koikai, a radio presenter-turned-politician who bravely shared her two-decade struggle with endometriosis and adenomyosis.
Njambi's battle with these diseases saw her lose friends, relationships, jobs, and even some of her organs.
Her story sheds light on the reality of menstrual pain for many women across Kenya, a topic that remains taboo and often silenced due to fear of job loss, judgment, and ridicule.
For me, menstrual leave isn't just about addressing physical pain; it's about equity and respect. It's about ensuring that no woman feels ashamed or disadvantaged because of a natural biological process.
My personal journey has been marked by moments of isolation and misunderstanding, but it has also fueled my passion to advocate for change.
Kenya has the opportunity to lead in Africa by enacting legislation that mandates paid menstrual leave for all female employees. This isn't just a policy change; it's a statement of values that prioritises the well-being of half of its population.
Let's learn from the successes of other nations and embrace menstrual leave as a crucial step towards gender equality and workplace fairness.
As we strive for a more inclusive society, let's not overlook the simple yet powerful act of recognising and supporting women during their menstrual cycle.
It's time to make period leave a reality in Kenya, not just for me or for you, but for every woman who deserves to work with dignity and without pain.
Together, let's champion menstrual health and workplace equity in Kenya.

https://nation.africa/kenya/news/gender/my-first-trip-to-uganda-and-the-drama-at-an-african-airport-4676620,"What you need to know:
- I had my first ever trip to Uganda last week.
- There is always something exciting and grown up about crisscrossing airport halls.
- We spent 55 minutes to fly from Nairobi to Entebbe, then spent about an hour going through the airport clearance.
I travelled to Uganda for the first time last week. I had two training sessions with reporters based at Nation Media Group, Uganda. One training was on impact measurement and the other on mobile journalism. As always, I was upbeat ahead of the trip. There is always something exciting and grown up about crisscrossing airport halls. There is also a sense of renewal that comes with being in a different country – especially for the first time. Also exciting was the fact that we would land at the Entebbe International Airport, and take a road trip to Kampala!
My trip started too early. I was traveling on a day the anti-Finance Bill protests were happening across the country. On such days, one is never sure of what the roads will look like and so, I worked with a lot of lead time. I arrived at JKIA four whole hours before my check in time. On hand, I had an old copy of The Notebook, a novel by Nicholas Sparks, which kept me busy.
Young adults
By the time I started making my way through the security checks, I was close to halfway through the page-turner story of Allie and Noah, who fell in love as teenagers and were now reconnecting as young adults, under very riveting circumstances.
The flight was smooth and took a cool 55 minutes. I remember taking a deep breath at touch down because I wanted to remember how it felt to see and inhale Uganda for the first time.
Going through immigration on arrival is usually a quick process from my previous travel experiences, and I knew that in no time, I would be out of the concrete and into space, taking pictures and videos of Entebbe as I settled for the 40-minute drive to Kampala.

It was after I collected my bag and was back to my ‘Time-to-see-Uganda’ mood that I started paying attention to the environment around me. There was a crowd of people. Everyone who had collected their bags seemed to be lingering around. Huge trollies with sometimes up to five large suitcases, children impatiently saying things to their parents, in languages I could not immediately decipher, replete travellers standing in various forms of impatience… I was hungry and feeling claustrophobic.
Untrained eye
The Entebbe airport is not large. We also seemed to have arrived at the same time as a long-haul large plane carrying hundreds of passengers. This explains why the lobby was teeming with many people who, for the untrained eye, looked like they were assembled for a political rally.
The scorching afternoon sun was making everything hot and unbearable. I spotted one of my colleagues, a regular traveller on that route and asked him why we were not moving at all.
“Shouldn’t we be heading out of the airport?” I asked. Then my heart was broken by his response. “We are on a queue; our luggage has to be checked again on the way out.”
And that is the story of how we spent 55 minutes to fly from Nairobi to Entebbe, and then end up spending about an hour going through the airport clearance.
As you would expect, tempers started rising. At some point, there was an altercation between a traveller and one of the airport staff. The exchange was a welcome distraction from all the drab. A traveller whipped out their phone and recorded part of the squabble.
Being exposed
An airport official who saw him insisted that he deletes the video. The crowds protested against what was seen as gagging by the airport official. In this day and age, when people walk around with secret cameras and can even record without your knowledge, my advice would be put your house in order if you are not comfortable with being exposed.
We moved slightly and I could see the scanning machine. Just one machine! The other machine had broken down. Several questions were going through my head – if they were going to insist on these seemingly pointless checks, why did they at least install enough scanners? Did they ever do an impact assessment of what this exercise achieves, apart from irritating and exhausting travellers?
My colleague, Bernard, who was ahead of us on the queue seemed to have read my mind.
“This thing is like a conveyor belt. I have been standing and watching this process. No single bag has been intercepted. In fact, no one is even monitoring the bags as they go through the scanning machines. The bags are simply put through on one side to come out on the other side.”

https://nation.africa/kenya/news/gender/unexpected-heroes-meet-the-boda-boda-riders-leading-war-on-digital-child-sex-abuse-4676846,"What you need to know:
- Boda boda riders, once accused of sexual harassment, are now at the forefront of combating online child sexual exploitation and abuse.
- Through various initiatives, these riders are being trained to identify at-risk children, educate communities, and report potential cases of abuse.
In the bustling streets of Nairobi and Mombasa, an unlikely group of champions has emerged in the fight against (OCSEA).
Boda boda riders, once accused of perpetuating sexual harassment, are now at the forefront of protecting vulnerable youth from digital predators.
Early this year, Elly Kegode, a boda boda rider in Nairobi's Kawangware estate, received a distressing call from a young relative. The 19-year-old girl had been lured to Mombasa by a man she met on Facebook, only to find herself trapped in a nightmare of sexual abuse.
""She told me the man who had invited her to Mombasa was sexually abusing her. Two of the man's friends who lived with him were also sexually abusing her, in turns,"" Kegode recounts.
He guided her to escape, and upon her return to Nairobi, ensured she received medical attention and counselling.
This harrowing tale is not an isolated incident.
Eliud Wekesa, another boda boda rider from Kibra in Nairobi, shares a similar story about his 16-year-old daughter. After buying her a smartphone for studies, he was shocked to discover she was communicating with two different men on Facebook and TikTok, planning to meet them in Mombasa.
""When I took her phone, I was very shocked and lost for words when I followed the entire conversations that they were having in the two social media platforms and realised that the men had actually sent her Sh5,000 for her transport to Mombasa,"" Wekesa reveals.
These accounts mirror the experiences of countless unsuspecting girls across Kenya who have fallen victim to online predators.
The internet, while a powerful tool for education and connection, has also provided a sinister avenue for online child sexual exploitation and abuse (OCSEA).
A recent study conducted by Unicef, End Violence Against Children, and Interpol titled ""Disrupting Harm in Kenya"" sheds light on the alarming prevalence of OCSEA.
Of the 1,014 internet-using children interviewed, two-thirds admitted to never having been taught about online safety. Fourteen per cent of children aged 12-17 had met someone face-to-face after first encountering them online in the past year, with six per cent sharing nude images or videos of themselves.
Most disturbingly, nine girls reported being subjected to sexual abuse and exploitation after meeting an offender in person following online contact.
Recognising the urgency of the situation, organisations like Child Fund have launched initiatives to combat OCSEA.
The Safe Community Linkages for Internet Child Safety (SAFE CLICs) Project, implemented in collaboration with Childline Kenya and LifeSkills Promoters, has engaged 1,800 boda boda riders across Nairobi, Kiambu, Kilifi, and Mombasa counties.
Disturbed by his relative's ordeal at the hands of online sex predators, Kegode decided to join the campaign that raises awareness against OCSEA. He was fortunate to receive training from Child Fund, an organisation championing child rights in Kenya and beyond.
We are keen to find out what the campaign entails and so, on a cloudy morning, we arrive at Bahati Secondary School hall in Soweto, Nairobi County. The air is thick with anticipation as we enter a packed room filled with boda boda riders from the area. At the front stands Kegode, his voice carrying authority and concern as he addresses the crowd.
He is leading a crucial education session on OCSEA. The riders listen intently as he outlines the various forms this insidious threat can take, from online grooming to sexual extortion and live streaming of abuse.
""As boda boda operators, we have a unique responsibility,"" Kegode emphasises. ""We must be vigilant protectors of the children we transport daily, especially young girls who are particularly vulnerable to these online predators.""
The session goes beyond mere awareness. Kegode delves into the legal ramifications of OCSEA offenses, ensuring the riders understand the severity of these crimes in the eyes of the law.
He also provides valuable information on the remedies and support available to victims, empowering the riders to become not just transporters, but potential lifelines for children at risk. The attentiveness of the audience speaks volumes about the impact of this initiative.
These riders, once viewed with suspicion, are now being transformed into frontline defenders in the fight against online child exploitation.
Francis Maina, chairperson of the Soweto Boda Boda Association, notes that the initiative's impact has been significant, as evidenced by the many riders now involved. He explains that beyond targeting riders, they are also educating parents and children about OCSEA, its nature, and the dangers it poses.
Beatrice Muema, SAFE CLICs’ project coordinator, explains, ""The group is very paramount in taming cases of online sexual abuse. They have in the past been accused to contribute to sexual harassment and abuse, teenage pregnancies and insecurity but we are now changing the narrative. The operators are now our surveillance team on online sexual exploitation of girls.""
In addition to engaging riders, the project works with 60 schools in Nairobi and Mombasa, training 120 peer educators to spread awareness among their classmates.
Child Fund Kenya Director Alice Anukur emphasises the importance of this multi-stakeholder approach: ""We are working with different stakeholders to create awareness on the issue. The more the awareness the more our girls and children in general are safe.""
The initiative has already shown promising results, with an increase in reported cases of online abuse and coordinated responses in areas where the project operates.
About 500km away in Bombolulu, Mombasa County, a similar initiative is unfolding among the boda boda riders.
On this sweltering morning, we visit the East African Pentecostal Church hall in Nyali. Despite the oppressive heat, the riders are fully engaged, their attention fixed on Joseph Akoth, an OCSEA champion and fellow boda boda rider. Occasional notes are jotted down in notebooks as the riders, undeterred by the scorching sun, demonstrate their commitment to learning about this emerging threat to their daughters' well-being.
Samuel Ogutu, the Mombasa County Boda Boda Operators chairperson, proudly states, ""We hold two meetings every month to sensitise our members about OCSEA. We also use the various WhatsApp groups and other social media forums to amplify our campaign against this vice.""
The involvement of boda boda riders in this campaign has surprised many, given their previous reputation. However, their unique position in the community has proven invaluable in the fight against OCSEA.
John Ngugi, Childline Mombasa County Coordinator, notes, ""The riders are involved in transportation of the girls when going to meet the perpetrators. Using them has helped us to nab many of these culprits.""
Miriam Kimemia, a child rights activist in Mombasa, echoes this sentiment: ""Boda boda operators are doing a commendable job and are our greatest asset as gender and human rights activists. They act as our informers and allies in this work.""
Thanks to the riders' intervention, numerous arrests have been made, and several cases of defilement are currently in court. Miriam says about 20 cases have resulted in convictions, with sentences ranging from 15 years to life imprisonment.
However, challenges remain, Miriam says. Poor evidence collection often leads to acquittals, and there's a need for more specialised personnel to handle OCSEA cases. The Anti-Human Trafficking and Child Protection Unit (AHTCPU), a specialised police unit, currently has only five OCSEA-focused officers.
In Nairobi, the project is currently being implemented in seven sub-counties namely, Starehe, Langata, Kibra, Embakasi West, Embakasi South, Embakasi Central and Embakasi South, and Kikuyu Sub-county in Kiambu County.
In Mombasa, it is being undertaken in Likoni, Mvita, Changamwe, Kisauni, Nyali and Jomvu, and also in Kikambala which is in Kilifi County.
Kenya has taken steps to address OCSEA through national policies, including the National Plan of Action against Sexual Exploitation of Children in Kenya (2018-2022) and the National Information, Communications and Technology Policy (2019). However, these policies have yet to be widely disseminated or fully implemented.
For those seeking help or wishing to report cases of OCSEA, several channels are available. The Childline helpline 116 is a 24/7 toll-free phone service, offering online chat and SMS options for children to report abuse. Childline Kenya operates in partnership with the Department of Children's Services and works closely with the Directorate of Criminal Investigations and the AHTCPU.

As the digital landscape continues to evolve, so too must the efforts to protect Kenya's youth from online predators. By empowering unlikely heroes like boda boda riders and fostering open dialogue about online safety, the country is taking crucial steps to safeguard its children in the digital age.
“So far, we have about 50 cases of defilement in court, many of which have been a result of girls being lured online. A good number of these cases are as a result of intervention by the riders,” Ms Kimemia tells the Voice.",2024-07-03
https://nation.africa/kenya/news/kenya-s-meandering-history-of-dialogue-4677368,"President William Ruto's establishment of a National Multi-Sectoral Forum (NMSF) to engage with stakeholders and address youth concerns has created a new platform for dialogue, reflecting Kenya's meandering efforts to resolve its key problems.
For nearly three decades, successive regimes have resorted to the formation of various dialogue teams to address specific concerns.
While some teams have borne fruit, others have only gobbled up taxpayers' money and ended up with recommendations that were either not implemented or their efforts halted by court rulings.
President Ruto is already facing opposition from the youth following his call last Saturday for the formation of the NMSF to address the concerns of young Kenyans (Generation Z) who have been staging successive anti-government protests.
During a media interview with editors at State House Nairobi on Sunday evening, President Ruto agreed to engage Kenya's youth on whatever platform they prefer, not necessarily through the multi-sectoral forum.
Some have called on the Head of State to address their issues on the X space.
“If the young people do not want a multi-sectoral forum and prefer an engagement on X space, I am ready,” the president said.
The President has continued to feel the heat over his pursuit of the NMSF, with the Raila Odinga-led Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya Coalition calling on him to implement the report of the National Dialogue Committee (NADCO) before any further talks.
National Assembly Minority Leader Opiyo Wandayi argues that while dialogue is good for the country, ""it is good to demonstrate commitment and good faith whenever there are talks about matters of national conversation"".
""Let us see a commitment by the government to have the implementation of NADCO report fast-tracked as a demonstration of good faith and commitment before we can have another dialogue,"" the Ugunja MP said.
Githunguri MP Gathoni Wamuchomba also said the NADCO report had yet to be debated or adopted in parliament and was ""gathering dust on the shelves"".
“No wonder we are yet to constitute IEBC. Then came Gen Zs in the struggle; they aroused a national economic concern amidst protests. They (government) again conceded and are planning to form a new multi-sectoral committee. Allow me to call it NADCO 2. I can attest to this: any committee reports that require action by the Kenyan parliament are as dead as a dodo,” the legislator said.
She argues that President Ruto’s multi-sectoral committee will be another stunt “to buy time and scatter the already compounding voice of the disappointed youth of Kenya.”
President Ruto's multi-sectoral forum comes hot on the heels of NADCO, which was formed last year following a truce between President Ruto and Odinga that ended months of violent anti-government protests.
The ceasefire was brokered in Mombasa by Nigerian former President Olusegun Obasanjo.
Before the formation of NADCO, Kenya had gone through months of rigorous campaigning for the implementation of the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI), a product of former President Uhuru Kenyatta's team and that of Odinga ahead of the 2022 general elections.
However, the duo's quest suffered a major setback when the Supreme Court finally put the brakes on the ex-president's bid to make sweeping constitutional changes through the initiative.
President Ruto, Kenyatta's deputy at the time and a fierce opponent of the BBI, said the changes would have led to an all-powerful presidency, while Kenyatta argued that the proposal would promote power-sharing between competing ethnic groups.
The BBI contained clauses that advanced the one-man-one-vote-one shilling revenue-sharing formula that Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua is now vouching for after leading his Mt Kenya region to join Ruto in opposing the BBI initiative in 2021/2022.
The current dialogue teams also mirror the Inter-Parties Parliamentary Group (IPPG) formed in the run-up to the 1997 general election.
At the time, many people were demonstrating in the streets to push for minimal legal reforms.
The IPPG was a coalition of political parties and parliamentarians formed to facilitate political reform and ensure free and fair elections.
The IPPG played a significant role in advocating for constitutional and electoral changes, which led to the amendment of various laws to promote a more democratic and transparent political environment in Kenya.
The group was instrumental in pushing for reforms that paved the way for more competitive and fair elections in the country.
Other past dialogue teams in the country include the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission (TJRC), the Commission of Inquiry on Post-Election Violence (CIPEV), the Constitution of Kenya Review Commission (CKRC) and the National Dialogue and Reconciliation Process (Agenda 4).
The TJRC, for example, was established to investigate human rights violations and other historical injustices that occurred between independence in 1963 and 2008, following the 2007-08 post-election violence that claimed more than 1,300 lives and displaced over 600,000 people.
The Commission's mandate included investigating gross human rights violations, economic crimes, illegal acquisition of public land and other forms of historical injustice.
The TJRC aimed to promote justice, national unity and reconciliation by establishing the truth about past abuses and recommending measures to prevent their recurrence.
The Commission concluded its work by submitting a final report with recommendations for reparations, policy changes and other measures to address the injustices identified.
The Commission of Inquiry on Post-Election Violence (CIPEV), also known as the Waki Commission, was also established in Kenya to investigate the causes and effects of the violence that erupted after the disputed 2007 presidential election.
The Commission was chaired by Justice Philip Waki and was mandated to investigate the facts and circumstances surrounding the violence, identify the roles played by state security agencies and other actors, and recommend measures to prevent future occurrences of such violence.
The Waki Commission's final report, published in October 2008, provided a detailed account of the violence, identified key perpetrators and recommended significant reforms to Kenya's electoral, judicial and security systems.
One of the key recommendations was the establishment of a special tribunal to try those responsible for the violence, failing which cases should be referred to the International Criminal Court (ICC).
On the other hand, the Constitution of Kenya Review Commission (CKRC) was established to review and make recommendations for comprehensive reform of the Kenyan constitution.
It was tasked with conducting a thorough review of the existing constitution, engaging with the public to gather their views, and drafting a new constitution that would reflect the aspirations and needs of the Kenyan people.
Its work culminated in the drafting of a new constitution, which was put to a national referendum.
The process faced several challenges and delays, but ultimately contributed to the promulgation of a new constitution in 2010 that introduced significant changes, including a more decentralised structure of government, improved checks and balances, and stronger protection of human rights.
These teams and commissions have been instrumental in addressing various political, social and constitutional issues in Kenya.
There was also the National Dialogue and Reconciliation Process (NDRP), which was initiated following the 2007-08 post-election violence.
The process was mediated by a panel led by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan under the auspices of the African Union.
The NDRP aimed to address the immediate crisis and lay the foundations for sustainable peace and reconciliation in Kenya, leading to the formation of the Grand Coalition Government between then President Mwai Kibaki and Odinga, who was appointed Prime Minister, ending weeks of violent protests.
Following the recent anti-tax protests in the country, President Ruto last Saturday announced the formation of a National Multi-Sectoral Forum (NMSF) that will include religious organisations among other stakeholders to address the concerns of the youth (Gen Z generation) who have been the face of the anti-government anger.
He said all national level umbrella organisations representing the youth, civil society, religious organisations, professional bodies, business organisations, academia, student leadership, majority and minority leaders in Parliament, the Council of Governors and other stakeholders will nominate representatives to form the National Steering Committee (NSC) of the NMSF.",2024-07-02
https://nation.africa/kenya/news/politics/interior-cs-warns-of-more-chaos-as-protests-turn-violent-4677520,"Interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki has warned that protesters are planning more chaos and looting on Thursday and Sunday this week promising that they will firmly be dealt with.
During Tuesday's protests against the controversial Finance Bill 2024 which has since been shelved, traders in parts of Nairobi whose shops were attacked and looted banded together to protect their businesses from looters they said were disguised as protesters.
In a statement, CS Kindiki said this reign of terror against the people of Kenya and the impunity of dangerous criminal gangs must end at all costs.
""The government is determined to stop criminals who seek to terrorise the public and harm Kenya, despite attempts to politicise crime,"" he said.
The CS regretted the Tuesday, June 25, unprecedented riots that broke out in Nairobi and several other cities in Kenya, resulting in loss of lives, destruction or looting of property worth billions of shillings and an attempt to burn down Parliament Buildings.
He said the riots, which were legitimately initiated as a democratic expression of public disapproval of the Finance Bill 2024, led to the termination of the Bill.
""The termination of the Bill, hordes of marauding criminal gangs who continue to pose a grave danger to the public, riding on announced plans for peaceful protests to disrupt public order, commit arson, obstruct public transport and terrorise the people of Kenya with violence,"" CS Kindiki said.
President William Ruto recently said that Sh2 billion worth of property and goods had been lost since the demonstrations began.
While defending the police, the CS said they continued to act professionally and with restraint in dealing with highly provocative situations that arose during the violent riots.
""The Government commends all law enforcement officers who continue to discharge their challenging mandate of preventing crime and protecting the lives and property of the people of Kenya. Allegations of some instances of unlawful conduct by law enforcement officers will be investigated and appropriate action taken,"" he added.
Prof Kindiki further said that security agencies remain vigilant to intercept and thwart harm to the public and attempts to attack critical infrastructure and emblems of our sovereignty.
""Upon completion of the ongoing analysis of evidence, the government assures the public that the planners, perpetrators and financiers of large-scale arson, violent robbery and other heinous crimes will be brought to justice.""
His remarks come as Kenyans expressed concern over police conduct during Tuesday's ongoing anti-government protests, now in their third week.
Tuesday's protests, which took place in several counties, resulted in widespread destruction of property and looting, leaving business owners with significant losses.
During a meeting with bishops from the African Independent Pentecostal Church of Africa (AIPCA), the President vowed to deal decisively with the ""thugs"" who invaded and torched Parliament buildings during last week's protests.
According to Ruto, those responsible for the violence were criminals who exploited a peaceful protest against the Finance Bill and they must face the full force of the law.
""Those who set fire to Parliament are not our children, they are criminals and we will look for them. They will not get away; you cannot destroy public property,"" Ruto said.",2024-07-03
https://nation.africa/kenya/news/politics/wetangula-ichung-wah-face-wrath-mps-over-partisanship--4677312,"National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetang’ula is a man under siege, with MPs questioning his leadership style and calling for his removal.
They also want President William Ruto’s United Democratic Alliance (UDA) party to remove Mr Kimani Ichung’wah from his position as majority leader.
The lawmakers say the events following last Tuesday’s vote on the Finance Bill, 2024 proved that the House leaders and members had lost touch with their constituents.
Nominated MP and Public Accounts Committee (PAC) chairman John Mbadi said Mr Wetang’ula was the biggest problem in the August House, accusing him of killing quality debate and not being an impartial arbitrator.
Kitui Rural MP David Mwikali Mboni urged President Ruto to undertake a purge in the House leadership.
“The aftermath of the happening at Parliament Buildings confirms that Kenyans have lost confidence in their representatives,” Mr Mboni said.
Nandi Senator Samson Cherargei said the speaker had failed.
“How can you be a Speaker when you always dismiss members’ complaints yet they are the ones who voted to put you in office?” Mr Cherargei posed.
Some leaders, especially in President Ruto’s Kenya Kwanza Alliance, who requested not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, also expressed their misgivings over Tuesday’s events, accusing the leadership of the House of being arrogant.
Apart from Mr Wetang’ula and Mr Ichung’wah, they also want Majority Whip Silvanus Osoro replaced.
“They lack leadership skills. Parliamentary leadership is about lobbying and that doesn’t mean ignoring the minority side just because they lack numbers. Voters are attacking us because of their remarks in public and also in the House,” said a Kenya Kwanza MP from the Central region.
Mr Mbadi took issue with Mr Wetang’ula’s dismissive attitude, denying members an opportunity to discuss the bill after it was slotted in the order paper without the approval of the House Business Committee (HBC).
On the deployment of the military to deal with protesters, Rarieda MP Otiende Amollo took to social media platform X last Wednesday to express dismay at how the National Assembly conducted itself while approving the motion “without the media, without most members, without proper debate, in a record 30 minutes.”
The National Assembly, the MP insisted, “has just made Kenya a military State.”
“He doesn’t consult. He does not engage members and he is very aloof. He is to blame for the things that have happened in the House. The Finance Bill, 2024 could have been passed without the unnecessary drama but through dialogue and listening to Kenyans, who are our bosses,” Mr Mbadi lamented.
While Tuesday’s invasion of Parliament Buildings by anti-Finance Bill, 2024 protesters may have exacerbated Mr Wetang’ula’s woes, the writing had been on the wall since the early days of the 13th Parliament when the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Coalition Party questioned his ruling that declared Kenya Kwanza the majority outfit.
The coalition stormed out of the House in protest and accused Mr Wetang’ula of dictatorship and ignoring facts on the number of MPs from both camps as had been provided by the Registrar of Political Parties.
In his ruling delivered in October 2022, Mr Wetang’ula declared Kenya Kwanza the majority party in the National Assembly with 179 members against Azimio’s 157.
Last week, during the second reading of the Finance Bill, 2024, three senators accused the Speaker of denying them an opportunity to follow the debate from the public gallery.
Senators Edwin Sifuna (Nairobi), Godfrey Osotsi (Vihiga), and Ledama Ole Kina (Narok) said that despite writing to the Clerk of the National Assembly for permission to be allowed into the public gallery, they were still barred from attending.
Addressing journalists at Parliament Buildings, the senators said they were told to watch the proceedings on television.
“Why was I elected to this House if I cannot follow the debate? How will I mobilise my ODM MPs to ensure they vote against this Finance Bill?” lamented Mr Sifuna, terming the move as a “cowardly act” by the Speaker.
Mr Osotsi accused the Speaker of being unfair and running the House “like a baraza in Kamukuywa market ( a trading centre in Mr Wetang'ula's Bungoma backyard).”
Mr Ole Kina accused the Speaker of turning the legislature into an appendage of the executive.
“He is drunk with power,” Mr Ole Kina said.",2024-07-03

- Despite the High Court banning the use of teargas, anti-riot police defied the order.
- In Nakuru, one person was shot and seriously injured as police engaged protesters.
Anti-government protesters on Tuesday made good their threat to occupy major streets across the country which paralysed normal operations in cities and towns.
Despite the High Court banning the use of teargas, anti-riot police defied the order and fired at protesters who lit bonfires as they demanded the resignation of President William Ruto.
The chaos spilled onto Nairobi Expressway at the Mlolongo footbridge as demonstrators blocked the key road and inconvenienced hundreds of motorists.
Waving placards, the protesters chanted their dissatisfaction with the government over the high cost of living, unemployment and perceived corruption as Kenyans struggle.
The situation escalated quickly, prompting the deployment of a contingent of Recce Squad officers to restore order.
One of the protesters, Francis Mutuku, said they will not relent in their quest to ensure accountability and transparency in the government.
“Our children are struggling to find jobs and life is becoming increasingly difficult and expensive. The President has only two choices; either he listens to us or he resigns. We need action, not empty promises,” he said.
For the better part of the day, Nairobi’s Tom Mboya Street, Mfangano Street and Luthuli Avenue were turned into a battleground as protesters and the police engaged each other in running battles.
Earlier on, a few buses operated at the Machakos Country Bus.
At Muthurwa and Wakulima markets, a few traders were going about their business but many stalls remained closed.
Magistrates at Milimani Law Courts put off all cases scheduled for mention and hearing until today.
Robbery cases were reported at Khoja Roundabout and near Old Nation House along Tom Mboya Street in Nairobi. In one case, some rowdy youth roughed up a trader and made away with his phone and wallet.
The emergence of criminals and looters during the protests forced members of the business community along Ronald Ngala, Mfangano Street, Hakati Road and Luthuli Avenue to team up and protect their businesses.
On the other hand, the busy Jogoo Road, which connects the Nairobi central business district to the populous Eastlands, was a no-go-zone with demonstrators facing off with police in a duel for the better part of the afternoon.
Teargas and gunshots rent the air between Kamukunji Roundabout and City Stadium as demonstrators lit bonfires in protest.
Some protesters who openly carried machetes, rungus and stones did not relent even when the police repulsed them using teargas and fired into the air.
While police battled them from the main road, a section of protesters hid inside Muthurwa Market and occasionally came out to throw stones at the officers.
In Kitengela town, Kajiado County, business was brought to a standstill after youthful protesters barricaded Namanga Road.
They gave officers from Kitengela Police Station a hard time as they tried to out a bonfire on the busy highway.
Some buses ferrying passenger and trucks carrying goods to and from Tanzania were blocked. Some of the vehicles turned back.
“We have at least 50 trucks ferrying perishable goods and more loaded with cereals stranded at the border point. We will wait for normalcy to return,” truck driver Joseph Mwangindi told the Nation.
In Nakuru, one person was shot and seriously injured as police engaged protesters in running battles.
The man was shot in the arm during a confrontation between the police and protesters along Kenyatta Avenue.
The confrontation happened as police attempted to disperse the crowds that were disrupting operations and traffic in the Nakuru central business district.
Earlier, the protesters had attempted to block the busy Nakuru-Eldoret highway but were repulsed by the police who fired teargas at them.
Major supermarkets such as Naivas and Cleanshelf were closed as the owners feared that their businesses would be looted by the rowdy crowds.
Kenya Prisons Service officers were deployed to help beef up security.
The neighbouring Bomet, Kericho and Narok towns, however, remained largely calm as police patrolled the areas.
In Kilifi County, a peaceful protest in Mtwapa was disrupted by anti-riot police officers after they lobbed teargas at the demonstrators as they marched past Mtwapa Sub-County Hospital.
The move caused confusion and panic as medical staff and patients took to their heels to avoid the choking teargas.
The protesters became violent and blocked the Mtwapa-Kilifi highway; lit bonfires and threw stones at the police. Traders hurriedly closed their businesses.
In Mombasa, what began as a peaceful demonstration turned chaotic after criminal gangs from Kisauni and Likoni reigned terror on innocent residents.
In disguise of being demonstrators, the gangs robbed shops and burnt vehicles as the police watched helplessly.
They also robbed people of their valuables at Mwembe Tayari, the central business district, Dedan Kimathi Road and Nyerere Avenues. Traders are counting losses after their business premises were broken into.
Along Nyerere Avenue, a pharmacy and popular eateries were vandalised by the goons, who could be seem walking freely without any hindrance.
Along the same streets, four high-end vehicles were burnt as other motorists rushed to save their vehicles which were being targeted by protesters.
The demonstrations that had started peacefully at Pembe za Ndovu turned chaotic as soon as a bigger group from Kisauni and Likoni joined the protests at Saba Saba area.
Demonstrations did not take place in Lamu, Matuga, Kinango and Lungalunga sub-counties.
The streets in Ukunda, Kwale County were deserted as criminals attacked residents and businesspeople.
Businesswoman Meswaleh Athman in Darad, Ukunda said that even though there was no violence in the area, traders would return home empty handed because customers stayed at home for fear of getting mugged.
Kwale County Commissioner Stephen Orinde said that the police were on high alert to smoke out criminals who infiltrated the protests.
In Kisumu County, the police acted with a lot of restraint as the march by protesters was largely peaceful.
Compared to the previous ones, the crowd looked subdued but managed to march from Kondele to the Kisumu State Lodge.
In Kisii County, protesters attempted to storm the home of Nyaribare Chache Member of Parliament Zaheer Jhanda.
The demonstrations started at Capital Roundabout in Kisii town where protesters barricaded the road and chanted “Ruto must go”.
They divided themselves into groups and used different roads leading to Mr Jhanda's home as the police remained on high alert.
In Eldoret, a contingent of officers started patrolling the town as early as 7am.
In Karatina, Nyeri County, there was drama when demonstrators took to the streets singing funeral dirges. “Pall bearers” carried a casket and sang dirges as they dramatised “a mock burial of the President”.
The youthful demonstrators said the casket symbolised those killed during last week's demos.
There was a heavy police at major supermarkets across the town, while some businesses opted to remain closed.
This was after protesters last week looted Chieni Supermarket which belongs to Kieni MP Njoroge Wainaina.
There were also police officers on roads leading to universities and colleges in and near the town.
In Kirinyaga County, the Central Region National Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK) lit candles in memory of the youth who died during last week’s protests. The clergy told the government to stop using the police to violently break up peaceful demonstrations.
Speaking at Sagana Bethany House in Kirinyaga County, the regional NCCK officials stressed that it was the right of the youth to picket peacefully as they contributed to the reshaping of the country.
“The use of excessive force that includes shooting demonstrators must be stopped,” said the regional treasurer, Reverend David Njuguna.
The clergy also told the government to unconditionally release all those who were arrested during the anti- Finance Bill demonstrations.
Learners in Laikipia County, who were scheduled to report back to school yesterday after the mid-term break, were advised to remain at home in the wake of the street protests.
In Garissa County, unlike last week when there were protests, the region remained relatively calm with people going on with their usual business.
In Kakamega County, Kenya Defence Forces soldiers kept vigil in the central business district.
In Kitui South, youth at Mutomo market took to the streets to demonstrate against their MP Rachael Nyamai for voting for the passage of the controversial Finance Bill.
The peaceful youths were earlier attacked by hired goons wielding crude weapons including bows and arrows before the police intervened and arrested the attackers.

https://nation.africa/kenya/news/protests-6-politicians-businessman-two-ngos-state-s-radar-4677172,"Six politicians, a businessman and two NGOs are on the radar of State intelligence and security agencies following suspicion of their involvement in fueling ongoing anti-government protests.
Failure to obtain hard evidence of the suspects’ logistical and financial connection to the protesters has, however, intensified abductions as the State agencies seek grounds to arrest and prosecute them, interviews with multiple people familiar with the investigations have established.
The suspects are accused of mobilising youths from slum areas and giving them cash handouts with instructions to infiltrate and turn violent the protests by largely peaceful and unarmed demonstrators.
Three politicians from Nairobi, two from Central, one from Rift Valley, a businessman from Rift Valley and two Non-Governmental Organisations (one local and another international) are suspected to be financing the now three-week old anti-tax protests, according to a high-level intelligence brief seen by the Nation.
The hitherto peaceful protests turned violent on Tuesday last week culminating in the burning of a section of Parliament buildings, City Hall and many other public as well as private property across the country.
Tuesday’s protests were also characterised by closure of highways by stone-throwing goons, looting and damage of property.
The security dossier places blame on these individuals and entities whom it accuses of bankrolling some of the protesters.
The mass demonstrations have rocked Nairobi and at least 35 counties, forcing President William Ruto to announce the withdrawal of the Finance Bill, 2024 that contains a raft of widely unpopular tax increases.
National Assembly lawmakers on Tuesday last week passed the controversial Bill in defiance of raging nationwide anger against high cost of living, prompting angry protesters to storm the House.
At least 39 people have been killed and hundreds more injured in the anti-government demonstrations, according to the State human rights watchdog.
The government has sought to downplay the casualty figures, with the President even disputing the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR) tally.
The intelligence brief claims the individuals and entities were providing logistical support to the demonstrators, including transport to the epicentres of the protests, like the central business districts of major cities.
A Nairobi politician is accused of mobilising and hiring goons from Kibera, Mathare and babadogo areas.
Another politician from Nairobi is said to have held a series of night meetings to plan for the demonstrations, according to the intelligence brief that has been shared with top security chiefs in Nairobi.
Also under watch is a politician from the Rift Valley who is accused of holding a meeting of youths at his house in Nairobi to oil the anti-government protests.
The brief seen by Nation had names of the key suspects, which are, however, withheld for legal reasons.
Security agencies have been accused of going on an overdrive abducting political activists, online influencers and other individuals with huge following on social media in an attempt to infiltrate the planning and coordination of the protests.
The Generation Z age-group had taken pride in forming an online movement that has largely operated without a single leader, united by a quest to defeat the unpopular Finance Bill, 2024, as well as tackle the country’s corruption and governance shortcomings.
A special team of officers drawn from National Intelligence Service (NIS) and Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) has been fingered for effecting the brazen abductions, of which the national human rights watchdog has recorded 32 cases, but intelligence sources say interrogations of the suspects have not yet yielded a smoking gun.
Former Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter, the latest to be seized on Sunday before his wife and children, told journalists after his release that detectives questioned him about his relations with retired president Uhuru Kenyatta and deputy president Rigathi Gachagua.
Last week, Mr Gachagua publicly attacked NIS boss Noordin Haji, accusing him of failing to advise the President on the magnitude of the planned protests, and alleging a plot by NIS to link him and Mr Kenyatta to the mass demonstrations.
“Haji was peddling lies and propaganda trying to implicate former President Uhuru and me in the chaos,” Mr Gachagua told journalists in Mombasa as he demanded Mr Haji’s resignation.
A source familiar with the operations of the abduction squads told Nation that many of the kidnapped individuals did not yield information related to the demonstrations that the security agents have been looking for.
The information being sought by the interrogators includes communication on the planning of the demonstrations, the leaders and financiers of the protests.
The source had also earlier blamed the frosty relationship between the police command and the intelligence leadership for the government’s inability to quell the unrest.
“You find that the National Police Service leadership and the NIS are not reading from the same script on how to go about some of these things. You will find that the IG may not even be aware of who is being held where,” said the source.
It emerged the government was at sea on how to handle the demonstrations as they seemed not to have a face or formal leadership.",2024-07-03
https://nation.africa/kenya/news/rogue-police-officers-a-gallery-of-killer-cops-4676182,"They have become so brazen that they aim their guns directly at Kenyans, sometimes firing bullets and sometimes tear gas canisters, maiming, injuring and killing.
These people, police officers who are trained to safeguard and protect people's lives, have turned the script upside down and are now doing the exact opposite. They are accused of not only shattering the dreams of Kenyans agitated by the country's poor governance by inflicting maximum pain but also killing unarmed young protesters.
Kenya has seen an unusual kind of demonstration in the last two weeks. Young people, the Gen-Zs, have been engaging the police in running battles as they protest against the Finance Bill, 2024. Unlike their predecessors who came armed with crude weapons and stones, the Gen-Zs came armed with smartphones, bottles of water and placards.
Nevertheless, the police rained tear gas canisters, water cannons, blank and live bullets on the harmless youth. At least 24 Kenyans lost their lives, according to human rights groups in the country. Many of the dead were under the age of 30.
The first death was recorded on June 20, 2024, when a protester, 29-year-old Rex Masai, was shot dead as he ran from police officers in Nairobi.
The officer believed to have fired the fatal bullet was caught on CCTV. However, he did well to cover his face with a black cap. His face was eventually found through an online investigation that tracked his steps earlier that day.
He was wearing blue jeans and white sneakers. He later added a short-sleeved jacket. He was seen making rounds in various parts of the city, including along Kenyatta Avenue, Moi Avenue, Tom Mboya Street, City Hall Way, opposite the Supreme Court and on Uhuru Highway.
Kimathi Street
Along Kenyatta Avenue and Kimathi Street, another police officer, identified as Corporal Isaiah, who joined the police service in 2008, did his best to be remembered for his brutality.
Firstly, he was seen on several occasions firing multiple rounds of teargas at otherwise peaceful demonstrators, who learned to avoid his path as soon as they spotted him.
At one point, he fired a tear gas canister directly at journalists who were filming the police's ruthless treatment of a protester and bundled him into a police van.
At close range, no more than two metres, he aimed his firearm at the journalists and fired directly into the stomach of one journalist. He did this in the full knowledge that all the cameras had recorded his actions, a demonstration of the arrogance and sense of invincibility that has recently gripped some uniformed officers.
At Parliament, several officers were filmed firing live bullets at the thousands of youths who managed to break through the police barricade and enter the August House. They were armed with smartphones, water bottles and the Kenyan flag. Most of the youth believed that if they carried the flag, no one would dare shoot at them. They were wrong.
Within minutes, several people had been shot and, sadly, five had died.
One of the officers identified at the scene bore an uncanny resemblance to a retired Kenya Defence Force officer. This was not the first time he had been in the spotlight for the wrong reasons.
In April 2022, he was detained at Lang'ata police station after being accused of assaulting a woman at a popular club in the estate.
The officer, a gun-toting agent, is said to have fired into the air as he assaulted the woman, scaring away revellers who were enjoying their night out at the Summers Bar in Lang'ata, Nairobi County.
However, when contacted by the Nation, he denied being the person captured in photos taken at Parliament showing him and other officers firing directly at protesters.
On June 18, the very first day of the protests, social media influencer Hanifa Adan was arrested by plainclothes officers and her bag was snatched in full view of cameras by a plainclothes officer believed to be working at one of the city's main police stations.
Apart from these officers, whose faces and actions were captured, Kenyans have been concerned about the activities of an undercover police unit operating in an unmarked maroon Ford Ranger double-cabin vehicle. The officers in this feared vehicle have been spotted wearing overalls bearing badges and flags of different countries. Their faces, which are never seen, are always covered by heavy masks and caps to complete the sinister look.
The Nation understands that one of them is a musician who has released dancehall songs.
They have been accused of abducting and firing live bullets at protesters in the heart of the city over the past two weeks, with other officers carrying out the abductions at night.
Social media influencer
This was the story of social media influencer and Saturday Nation columnist Gabriel Oguda, who wrote in the local dailies that he was abducted from his home in the early hours of the morning. His phone was confiscated and, after being taken to several unknown locations, he was finally driven to Kajiado police station where he was held for almost two days, days punctuated by interrogations by police officers who wanted to know about his involvement in the anti-tax protests in the country.
Several other people believed to be leaders of the violent protests that have rocked 35 of the country's 47 counties have also been abducted on separate occasions over the past two weeks.
Some have returned so shaken that their hard-line anti-government stance has withered, even withdrawing from social media and protests.
One such person is the president of the Kenya School of Law (KSL), Joshua Okayo, who went missing last Wednesday (June 26) in Rongai, Kajiado County.
Before his disappearance, he had been a vocal critic of the now-withdrawn Finance Bill 2024, which many Kenyans felt would have burdened them with more taxes.
Mr Okayo was found three days later in Murang'a, where he was believed to have been dropped by his abductors. How he got there, some 103 kilometres from Rongai, is not known.
Regis Wanjala, an active social media influencer who has been involved in the protests, was also abducted on the same day and was found disoriented on a tea plantation in Ruiru last Saturday.
Former St Paul's University president Kevin Kori Gathura, who was abducted in Nairobi on Thursday and missing for three days, was found yesterday morning.
Another social media activist still missing is Kabatila Munyithya. He was last seen last Friday in Embulbul, Kajiado County. On the same night, at around 1am, he called for help, saying that unknown people had invaded his compound. This was the last time anyone heard from him.
Last Thursday was a day like no other in Rongai. Gunshots filled the air for most of the night. The police shot so indiscriminately that eight bullets landed on a 12-year-old child, Kennedy Onyango, who died on the way to hospital.
Locals accused the police of forcing subdued Kenyans, particularly those caught in the Clean Shelf Supermarket on suspicion of looting, to lie down before shooting them.
In Githurai, as President William Ruto addressed the nation last Tuesday following the protesters' successful entry into Parliament, thousands of residents lived in fear. The sound of gunshots filled the air for hours. Several people are reported to have died in the shooting.
One of the young men believed to have been among the rioters that Tuesday night was abducted before being released in Roysambu with serious head injuries.
In a separate incident, a doctor, Margaret Oyuga, who was assisting a protester with a bullet wound, tragically lost her life after being shot by a plainclothes policeman.
All this despite President William Ruto's directive last week that all abductions in the country must stop and that all those abducted and held incommunicado must be released with immediate effect.
On assuming power, the Head of State also vowed that there would be no more cases of abductions, extrajudicial killings and police impunity in his government.
He also reiterated the same sentiments in his media roundtable on Sunday, June 30, night, where he said he would not condone any form of extrajudicial killing and added that any police officers sent to quell the chaos that followed the anti-finance bill demonstrations would be held accountable for their actions during the protests.
To date, no officer has been arrested or tried for any of the above actions.
The Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) said in a statement last Friday that it had launched investigations into the deaths of two protesters, Rex Masai and Evans Kiratu, allegedly caused by the police.
Fatal shootings
In both investigations, the IPOA has attended the post-mortems and obtained reports on the cause of death. It has also taken witness statements and is currently analysing CCTV and video footage of Rex's shooting.
The authority also said it had summoned various police officers and obtained necessary police records to assist in the investigation.
Anne Makori, the chairperson of the IPOA, noted that they have observed fatal shootings of protesters in Nairobi and other parts of the country, shootings resulting in serious injuries to protesters, instances of excessive force by police officers against civilians and injuries to both civilians and police officers.
To date, the Law Society of Kenya (LSK) has raised pertinent questions about these unconstitutional police tactics and announced its plans to go to court to stop police officers from carrying out their duties without uniforms.
LSK chairperson Faith Odhiambo said they would be filing a petition over the dress code of police officers during demonstrations.
She said there were some police officers who were operating in civilian clothes and carrying guns, making it difficult to know whether they were really on duty or not.
""We will file a petition. The police should be properly dressed and identifiable so that people know it is a police officer. Seeing police dressed as thugs and fully armed creates a lot of fear. How can you hold someone accountable if you cannot identify them?"" asked Ms Odhiambo.
She claimed that whenever police officers cover their faces with bandanas, their aim is to perpetuate violence.
The cases of abductions and enforced disappearances seem to have crossed the bridge and are now affecting police officers believed to be supporting the anti-government protests.
For example, police officer Jackson Kuria Kihara alias @Shakurthecop, who openly took and shared photos of himself carrying posters against the Finance Bill, 2024, much to the delight of social media users, went missing four days ago.
His family has been searching for him in vain, with all their pleas now directed at the government and President William Ruto to help locate the officer.
The Nation understands that the officer was released at 7pm on Monday.
His lawyer said the officer was driving inside Githurai when a vehicle blocked him.
""Three well-built men jumped out of the other vehicle and forcibly pulled him out of his car and into the other vehicle,"" Mr Njeru said, adding that he had been held incommunicado within Nairobi.
Some of the posters he shared on social media criticised some of the proposals in the Finance Bill 2024. He shared the images while dressed in full police uniform.
One poster read: ""Sanitary towels should be free. Unafikiria tax sana Zakayo. Power belongs to the people.""
Another read: ""Guns should not be used on peaceful demonstrators, save them (bullets) for Haitian gangs.
According to the National Police Service (NPS) Standing Orders, 'a police officer, when using social media privately, shall not purport to make an official comment on social media in his capacity as a national police officer on any incident, police policy or procedure without prior authorisation and in accordance with the media policy.
“The spokesperson appointed from the office of the Inspector General or respective Service Headquarters is responsible for representing the service externally on matters concerning communities, crimes, or policing Public comment as a private citizen,” the standing orders on the use of social media read.
Public debates
The orders do give police officers the right to enter into public debates and comment on social, economic or any other issue, however, any comment shall be made strictly as a private citizen and be separate from, and avoid any reference to matters of employment with the NPS.
The orders also caution the police not to refer to their position or profession whenever they are expressing an opinion or participating in public debate in a private capacity.
Mr Kuria’s lawyer, identified as Mr Njeru wa Muthoni on Monday, July 1, 2024, said they had already managed to get an anticipatory bail stopping officers from arresting his client.
This was after Kuria raised concerns saying he was receiving threatening calls and had no option but to go into hiding. The lawyer said officers attached to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations visited his client’s home and questioned the family about his whereabouts.
With his disappearance, plans to record a statement with the police have not yet materialized. The last time they spoke was last Friday. His vehicle was last seen in Githurai 45.
His family filed a missing person report at Kiamumbi Police Station.
“We do not remain with any other option but also enjoin the LSK and make noise until he is released,” he said.",2024-07-03

“I’m humbled to have been given a chance to interact and give tips to the athletes and I must admit that they are in good shape and just some fine tuning.
“It is a matter of being focused and pushing yourself a little bit further so that you can do well in the steeplechase. They need to work on their psychology. If we made it, they could also make it,” said Kemboi after the day’s training session at the Kipchoge Keino Stadium in Eldoret, Uasin Gishu County.
Athletes in 800m (men), 1,500m (women), 3,000m steeplechase (men and women), 5,000m (men and women) and the 10,000 (men and women) are camping at Kazi Mingi Farm, the former International Olympics Committee High Altitude Centre in Eldoret.
Athletes representing the country in 100m (men), 400m (men), 400m hurdles (men), 800m (women), 1,500m (men) and race walk (men) are camping at the Moi International Sports Centre Kasarani, in Nairobi.
The marathon team comprising Eliud Kipchoge, Benson Kipruto, Timothy Kiplagat (reserve), Peres Jepchirchir, Brigid Kosgei and Sharon Lokedi (reserve) are training in the North Rift region while Alexander Mutiso is training in Ngong and, Hellen Obiri in Colorado, USA.
Their paces
The Kenya steeplechase members that were going through their paces under Kemboi yesterday were former World Under-20 champions Amos Serem, Jackline Chepkoech and reigning World Under-20 champion Faith Cherotich. Kemboi said that he has been following up on the team since the national trials and he believes that they will bag men’s and women’s medals.
Kemboi had a glittering career bagging four world titles, 2009 Berlin, 2011 Daegu, 2013 Moscow and 2015 Beijing. Brimin Kipruto, the 2008 Olympic Games 3,000m steeplechase champion, gave the Kenyan Paris-bound steeplechase runners the thumbs up to do well.
He said the runners looked good but needed to work hard for glory in Paris. The other steeplechase runners in Team Kenya are Simeon Koech, Abraham Kibiwott, world record holder Beatrice Chepkoech and Commonwealth Games champion Jackline Chepkoech.
Ethiopia’s Lamecha Girma holds the world lead time this season of 8:01.63. Compatriot Samuel Firewu has run the second fastest time this season at 8:05.78. Kibiwott is the third fastest this season with a time of 8:07.38.
Benjamin Kigen won a bronze medal for Kenya at the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games in a race won by Morocco’s Soufiane El Bakkali while Ethiopia’s Lamecha Girma settled for silver. Kenya will also be eyeing the elusive women’s steeplechase gold Kenya.
The country’s best performance is bronze via Eunice Jepkorir at the 2008 Beijing Games, where the event was first introduced.",2024-07-03
https://nation.africa/kenya/sports/gaudencia-makokha-kenya-foremost-beach-volleyball-player--4677320,"Volleyball Olympian Gaudencia Makokha was barely five years old when her father Titus Makokha died in 1997.
Makokha's mother Dinah Wekesa was left to fend for the family that numbered seven children.
Makokha’s mother moved her from Kakoyi Primary School in Malava to Mahanga Primary School when the family relocated to Lugari in Kakamega County.
It's at Mahanga that Makokha’s interest in sports grew. She excelled in football, lawn tennis and basketball.
""I was tall compared to my peers. When I was in Class Seven, a teacher called Chumba suggested I try playing volleyball. After attending training sessions, a couple of weeks, the urge to know more about the sport grew and that is how I settled on volleyball as my preferred sport.
“The interest in the sport grew deeper when I started attending training sessions conducted by renown coach Moses Lukorito following an invitation from his mum.”
“Everything changed and that was my turning point in the sport,” Makokha said after the second edition of the Kenya Beach Games at Buntwani beach, in Kilifi County sponsored by the National Olympic Committee of Kenya (NOC-K).
""When I cleared Primary School at Mahanga, it was not easy for my mother to raise school fees not only for me but also for my siblings. She went through a lot, and on many occasions we would go to bed on empty stomachs.
""Sometimes we would stay at home because of lack of fees but, luckily, I got a scholarship to join Mahanga Secondary School. Coach Lukorito organised the transfers I made in secondary school.
""I moved from Mahanga to Lukhoho Girls High School then to St Christopher's Girls, before I completed my O level at Mabanga High School,"" the 31-year-old beach volleyball superstar said.
Makokha was part of the men's and women's Kenya beach volleyball teams that competed at the Confederation of Africa Volleyball (CAVB)Continental Cup-cum final round of Olympic in Casablanca, Morocco in June.
Sadly, neither team secured a Paris berth, putting paid to Makokha’s dream of a back-to-back Olympics appearance.
Makokha, had partnered with Brackcides Agala in 2021, defying the odds to qualify for Tokyo Olympics in Agadir, Morocco. The duo wrote history as the first Kenyans to play in Olympic Games beach volleyball.
To show her versatility, Makokha has paired with six other players, namely Eunice Maiyo, Edinah Rotich, Naomi Too, Jecinta Mueni, Agala and Yvonne Wavinya in an illustrious 15-year beach volleyball career.
She has stood the test of time to remain one of Kenya’s foremost beach volleyball players.
She says her mother, Dinah, now 79 years old, has been her chief motivator and the mother’s willpower to make things better for her family in the village has kept the daughter in the sport.
But why beach volleyball and not indoor volleyball?
""I didn't play conventional volleyball as much as I would have wanted to. I was unlucky at indoor volleyball. Sometimes I made the national team cut, sometimes I was overlooked.
“But after I made my international debut in beach volleyball in 2010, during the Continental Cup qualifiers in Mombasa, things have never been the same again. I have been a mainstay and regular player in the national team with different partners. It's a sport that needs patience, perseverance and understanding of your partner.
""Sometimes, I have considered quitting especially when all looked gloomy and we failed to get facilitation from the government for international assignments. But I look back and think of my mother, who single handedly took care of us, despite the hardships. I'm the breadwinner and have to stay put.
""If I quit, a lot of things in my life will stall because volleyball has helped me in many ways,"" said Makokha who has previously played indoor volleyball for KCB, Blue Triangle, Nairobi Water and Kenya Pipeline.
""I have played for over 10 years and played in almost every event with different players but I believe what has kept me going is the commitment, discipline and generally knowing what I want. God has also saved me from serious injuries unlike some of my partners. The sport has grown and has the potential to bring more medals for the country, but we must invest more in the sport to achieve that,"" she added.
Makokha says Kenyan School Games volleyball were competitive in their days but have lost their oomph.
""I remember the regional school games of 2008. We played against Lugulu Girls High School who eliminated us in the final. Despite the loss, I caught the eyes of the now Kenya and KCB coach Japheth Munala.
""He advised me to link up with KCB when schools were on break. I was a middle blocker then but when I went to KCB, the middle blocking department was flooded and coach Munala advised me to switch to outside hitter.
""People don't know that I'm actually a utility player, who can play in the centre, outside and opposite positions, ""says Makokha, who works at Kenya Pipeline Company, Operation Department in Mombasa County.
Makokha has special praise for former Kenya Ports Authority and former national men's and women's beach teams coach Sammy Mulinge now with Rwanda Patriotic Army, for taking a leap of faith in her.
Makokha says that little was known about beach volleyball a decade back and many players were not keen on the discipline.
“In 2010, coach Mulinge began teaching me beach basics, I really can't tell why he thought I was better suited for the sport, but I am glad I listened to him. I have excelled at the sport more than indoors.
“Who knows, were it not for beach volleyball, I wouldn't have played at the Olympics which is every player's dream. Beach volleyball has enabled me to tour and visit various countries that I only used to hear about.
""Beach volleyball has seen me compete at both the junior and senior World Championship, Commonwealth Games, African Games and Olympic"" said Makokha with a glint of satisfaction in her eyes.
How did it go?
""Mulinge fielded Too and I in the World Championship qualifiers event that was staged in Mombasa 2011. We did not qualify but went to Poland two years later for the World Championships after getting a wild card.
“The performance was dismal but I think the event was a stepping stone. It opened the doors for us and in 2019 we were paired with Too again and we won a silver medal in the African Games in Morocco"" says Makokha.
Makokha is now challenging upcoming players to listen and learn from their seniors.
""If I didn't listen or follow what coach Mulinge and Chumba had advised me to do, maybe I would not have achieved what I have. I would be somewhere lost in the village like my former school mates at Mahanga who are hopeless. But look at me now, I'm the pride of my village.
""In fact, when I'm in the media, my people back home are the ones who call me to tell me that I'm on television or in the newspaper. It shows that I'm the pride of my village,"" said Makokha.
“Sports pays and keeps young people away from vices,"" Makokha, who dreams of setting up a beach volleyball academy simply said.",2024-07-03

Sponsored by Exness
Oil and gold markets are poised for volatility as investors await crucial economic data that will set the tone for the short-term outlook. European flash inflation, US services PMI, FOMC minutes, and the US job report are all set to be released this week, potentially triggering significant price action.
""Investors are closely watching for any signs of a shift in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy or changes in the global economic landscape,"" Andreas Themistokleous, Exness Trading Specialist, commented.
The flash European inflation rate, expected to decline slightly for June, could weigh on the Euro. Meanwhile, the US services PMI is forecast to dip but still indicates continued expansion in the sector, potentially bolstering the Dollar.
All eyes will be on the FOMC minutes, where investors will scrutinise any hints from the Federal Reserve regarding future monetary policy decisions, particularly the timing of a potential rate cut.
""Gold is particularly sensitive to changes in interest rates and inflation expectations,"" adds Themistokleous. ""A dovish Fed could be a boon for gold, while a hawkish stance could put downward pressure on prices.""
Later in the week, Canada's unemployment rate is expected to see a minor increase, while the highly anticipated US job report will unveil the non-farm payrolls and unemployment rate data. A decline in NFP is anticipated, potentially putting downward pressure on the dollar.
Oil prices have been trading sideways recently, but the short-term outlook leans towards bearish sentiment unless a major catalyst emerges. Meanwhile, gold prices are grappling with uncertainty due to the unclear path of the Federal Reserve's rate cuts, mixed inflation data, and geopolitical tensions.
Technically, gold has been trading within a triangle formation for months, nearing the end of this pattern. A breakout from the triangle typically signals the short-term trend direction.
The contracting Bollinger Bands indicate low volatility, which is likely to increase after the breakout. The oscillator suggests that gold could move in either direction, adding to the anticipation surrounding the breakout.
For those looking to capitalize on these market movements, Exness, a leading broker in Kenya, offers the opportunity to trade CFDs on both gold and oil.
CFDs allow traders to speculate on the price movements of these commodities without owning the underlying asset. Trading CFDs does come with risks so it is important to have a strong risk management strategy in place.",2024-07-03
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/opinion-analysis/columnists/how-the-paints-industry-can-ride-the-sustainability-wave-4676816,"The construction industry is a significant contributor to environmental degradation.
It accounts for approximately 39 percent of global carbon emissions, with 28 percent coming from operational emissions from energy used to heat, cool, and light buildings, and the remaining 11 percent from materials and construction processes.
Additionally, construction is responsible for a large portion of waste production and the depletion of our natural resources.
The paint industry plays a significant role in construction process, and it is imperative to recognise the environmental impact associated with traditional paint production and consumption.
To be effective, paint companies must adopt eco-friendly practices in their production, operational and distribution processes. This includes minimising water usage, reducing pollution, transitioning to renewable energy resources such as solar in our plants and responsibly sourcing of raw materials.
Players in the paint industry need to proactively innovate solutions that will help in reducing their impact to the environment while ensuring we continue to enjoy the benefits that coatings can provide. We must strive to minimise waste, increase energy efficiency, and explore renewable energy sources to power our operations.
Initiatives in the industry such as the use of non-toxic, low Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) paints that are safer for both humans and the environment and investing in research and development, we can create innovative, eco-friendly paint formulations and processes that meet the highest standards of quality and performance.
Sustainable paints and coatings aim to minimise or eliminate VOCs, thereby reducing the carbon footprint and enhancing indoor air quality. These coatings offer a greener alternative while maintaining the performance and longevity expected in the industry.
Another way for the paint industry to play its part in protecting the environment is through the production of water-based coatings which are becoming increasingly popular due to their lower environmental impact. They contain fewer harmful solvents and are easy to clean up, making them an eco-friendly alternative to oil-based coatings.
Through innovation, we also have biodegradable coatings which are formulated with decomposable components, reducing their environmental impact at the end of their life cycle. This can also be supplemented by recycled content coatings which incorporate recycled materials, contributing to a circular economy and reducing the need for new raw materials.
To give an example of how this can be achieved Crown Paints Kenya Plc and its subsidiaries across the region, has adopted the guidelines, and technically achieved heavy metal free formulations, even though the cost of such products is imperatively high.
All paint decorative products need to be free from LEAD, CHROMIUM, MERCURY, and ARSENIC, this would indicate a significant awareness and responsibility to the environment where the industry operates. For example, there is need for paint firms to transition to renewable energy like solar power as a supplementary source of energy to run plants and office operations.
Beyond the production floor, players in the sector can also employ ingenious ways to remain sustainable by enforcing some simple yet significant changes.
Paint manufacturers can also phase out the use of fossil fuels by getting rid of equipment like diesel generators. This can be extended to other handling equipment like converting from diesel powered forklifts and vehicles to electric, alongside the reduction of plastic and usage of petroleum.
Simple measures such as rainwater harvesting, reuse of water and recycling of waste also go a long way in saving resources.
In summary, the shift toward sustainable practices in the paint industry and the stringent regulations surrounding them reflect the growing global commitment to environmental responsibility. The paints industry is at the forefront of this movement, embracing innovation and pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the quest for a greener and more sustainable tomorrow.
By navigating the green wave and embracing eco-friendly solutions, the paints industry can pave the way for a world where aesthetics, protection, and sustainability coexist harmoniously.",2024-07-02

As we progress, you will perhaps see more from a footprint perspective of the insurance business in the other regional markets in 2025 and beyond,” Equity Life Assurance Managing Director and Principal Officer Angela Okinda told shareholders last week.
Equity Group’s first insurance subsidiary was operationalised in March 2022 to provide life products and hit two years of operations in March 2024.
The unit closed the quarter ended March with Sh20.8 billion in total assets and with a pre-tax profit of Sh321 million, a 106 percent growth from Sh156 million in the same quarter last year.
Insurance service revenues for the unit were up by 40 percent to Sh508 million from Sh364 million in the same period last year.
Equity is seeking to leverage the fastest insurance growth segments including deposit administration and pensions, individual life assurance and group credit life.
The company is at the same time seeking to take advantage of low average insurance penetration rates in East Africa and the continent and the presence of just a few insurance companies in the market with limited success.
Last week, Equity Group shareholders approved the creation of a new health insurance subsidiary which will sit within Equity Group Insurance Holdings Limited which already oversees the group’s life and general businesses.
The lender is set to unveil new general insurance products in the second half of 2024 in Kenya.
Equity Group CEO James Mwangi says the insurance business has allowed the lender to diversify its product offering to customers, complementing actions to expand in the region.
“The insurance business is playing exactly where we had anticipated it. During these difficult times, we’ve realized that insurance is behaving very differently from banking. In our first nine months of operations, we got a return of 54 percent on equity at 68 percent in 12 months despite our balance sheet increasing four fold. Insurance is not very sensitive to interest expenses and so its behavior affirms our diversification in product offering,” he said.

We shall resume classes on Wednesday July 3, 2024,” reads one such message sent to parents.
“We are planning to have physical classes on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, then use the online platform on Tuesday and Thursday to cover more subjects. We would not want the children on harm's way,” another message from a school in Rongai read.
Learners did not turn up at Moi Avenue Primary School which is within the Nairobi Central Business District, but the teachers reported for duty. They later left as tension gripped the capitals as police engaged protestors in running battles and lobbed tear gas canisters at them.
“We weren’t asked not to take children to school but I couldn’t have allowed my children to come to school under such circumstances. Last week, the police officers were throwing the teargas canisters even inside the school compound,” Chris Were, a parent at the school told Nation.
Jamhuri High School which is in the Ngara area has not reopened after the learners took the half-term break on Wednesday last week. A worker at the school said that learning is expected to resume Wednesday.
Only 10 learners out of 250 showed up in the morning at St Brigid’s Public Primary School along General Waruingi Road in Pumwani area. They were released to go home at 10.00 am. The teachers were also allowed to leave.
“We didn’t tell the learners not to come. It’s the parents’ decision, which is good because we don’t have power to protect them in case their safety is compromised. We can’t punish learners for absenteeism under such circumstances,” a teacher at St Brigid’s told Nation. “The demonstrations are now affecting learning because even yesterday, only 50 learners turned up and we still don’t know what will happen tomorrow or on Thursday and next week,” another teacher said.
There were no learners at the adjacent Dr Agrrey Primary School as well as Muslim Primary School. At 11.45 am, the Nation found some parents at Muthaiga Primary School who had gone to withdraw their children. They said they feared that riots in the Mathare neighbourhood could spill over. Traffic along the usually busy Thika Road was light.
However, learning was going on in some schools like City Primary School in Ngara and Ainsworth Primary School along Muratina Street in Eastleigh.
In Homa Bay Town, many learners did not report to school for fear of being harmed by protesters. A few who went to school carried packed lunch to avoid confrontation with demonstrators when going back home for lunch.
At Shauri Yako Primary School, the head teacher, John Oguttu, said all teachers reported for duty and only a few learners did not show up. “We are proceeding with our studies as usual, however not all learners are present,” Mr Oguttu said.
The same problem was reported at Lake Primary School. Schools that were to reopen today after the half-term break advised parents not to release their children due to safety concerns. Parents with children at Ogande Girls received a message informing them that the school will open its gate on Wednesday.
“Please note that due to planned nationwide demonstrations on Tuesday July 2, 2024, our resumption date from half-term changes to Wednesday July 3, 2024,” read the message sent on Whatsapp.
In Kisii town, schools have partially opened their gates amidst the ongoing anti-government protests. The reopening date for learners at Kisii High School was pushed to Wednesday.
""The opening day from half-term has been moved to Wednesday July 3, 2024. Release the boys early enough,"" read a message from the school to parents.
Some parents took their children to school early Tuesday morning, fearing that the protests may intensity during the day. However, some learners were caught up in the protests after the Kisii Hospital road was blocked by protesters.
""Good morning team, you all know that our Form 1 and 4 are reporting back tomorrow, the challenge is with Form 2 and 3. Given the prevailing circumstances, I urge that those who will manage to allow their girls report tomorrow we have no objection,"" read a message from Sironga Girls High School.
Some parents in Siaya Town also did not release their children to go to school for fear of the planned demos dubbed #occupyeverywhere. Most of town’s streets remained deserted and businesses closed.
“I don’t trust these youths. Last week, one person was shot dead and that means the safety of my children is not guaranteed. They will go to school tomorrow,” John Ouma, a father of three told Nation.
A senior teacher at Siaya Township Primary School who did not want to be named said that learners who reported to school were less than half of the enrolment.
“We had a relatively low turn-out. Majority of the parents feared that their children might be caught up in chaos,” said the teacher.

https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/opinion-analysis/columnists/stringent-policies-drive-mushrooming-black-market-4676800,"Nicotine use can be traced back to 12,300 years ago. Global tobacco trends show a decline, with 1.25 billion people still smoking.
According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), 19 million stopped smoking two years ago which is a positive step. However, the demand for nicotine is persistent and unlikely to dissipate.
Nicotine consumption regulation should balance harm reduction, consumer protection, and realistic expectations about human behaviour while facilitating informed consumer choice. Basic safety standards are non-negotiable, and products must not contain harmful substances.
Regulation should provide consumers with accurate information and ensure transparent and trustworthy manufacturing and marketing without stifling innovation. Regulating harm-reduction products is simpler than perceived.
Attempts to curb nicotine use through prohibition or aggressive regulation have not only failed but often exacerbated the problem.
For instance, Australia’s stringent anti-nicotine policies have not eradicated nicotine use; instead, they have driven it underground, creating a black market fraught with unregulated and potentially hazardous products. The same has been observed in India.
Regulation must be justified on its merits. Over-regulation can limit consumer choice and drive people towards unregulated, potentially dangerous products. Therefore, regulatory measures should be carefully evaluated for their effectiveness and unintended consequences. Understanding consumer behaviour is the key to effective regulation.
Consumers make choices based on a variety of factors, including convenience, social influences, and product satisfaction—not solely on health risks. Regulation should, therefore, address information deficits, providing consumers with clear, truthful information about the relative risks and benefits of different nicotine products.
Informed choice is not merely about access to information but also about ensuring the information is understandable and actionable. Consumers are not experts in aerosol chemistry or toxicology; they rely on regulators to set standards that ensure the safety and quality of the products they use. The regulation of nicotine products, therefore, requires a balanced approach that acknowledges the persistent demand for nicotine and the complex motivations behind its use.
It is crucial to prioritize harm reduction and guide smokers toward safer alternatives. The WHO acknowledges harm reduction as a principle but often favours prohibition over harm reduction, which can lead to adverse consequences. Banning flavours and e-cigarettes may result in black markets. Regulations should enable informed choices and ensure product safety without driving consumers to unregulated markets.
The fear that children are taking up smoking new nicotine products due to the use of different flavours in the product still does not justify prohibition. As argued earlier, harm reduction products are much easier to regulate than invisible products which are sold underground. Unregulated products in a black market are much more dangerous to consume and will still get into the hands of children if parental oversight is present.
The debate over tobacco harm reduction and e-cigarettes is complicated by conflicting scientific evidence, which can influence public opinion and policy decisions. E-cigarettes present risks, especially for young people and non-smokers, but also offer a harm reduction tool for adult smokers. Misunderstandings about nicotine and the misuse of data further complicate the issue. Transparent research funding and rigorous peer review are essential to restoring trust in the scientific process.
Moreover, the influence of vested interests cannot be overlooked. Industry-funded studies and biased reporting have historically skewed perceptions, reinforcing the need for independent replication and rigorous peer review. Transparency in research funding and disclosure of conflicts of interest are essential to restoring credibility and trust in the scientific process.
Policy implications loom large in this arena. Flawed science can lead to regulations that harm public health. Balancing youth protection with harm reduction for adult smokers requires evidence-based policymaking grounded in comprehensive data.
Moving forward, we must champion a culture of skepticism and rigorous inquiry. Embracing post-publication peer review and promoting interdisciplinary collaboration can fortify the integrity of research in tobacco harm reduction. Empowering consumers with accurate information and encouraging open dialogue between stakeholders will foster a more nuanced public discourse, free from the distortions of bad science.
Effective tobacco harm reduction policy demands a commitment to evidence, ethics, and empathy. By prioritising public health and scientific integrity, we can navigate the complexities of vaping with clarity and compassion, forging a future where informed choices lead to healthier communities.
Moving beyond the binary of prohibition versus unregulated markets, thoughtful, evidence-based regulation can protect public health, empower consumers, and accommodate human behaviour. Embracing a nuanced regulatory framework allows us to better navigate nicotine consumption and create a healthier, more informed society.",2024-07-02
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/inside-sh1bn-wage-bill-dilemma-as-new-pay-falls-due-4677166,"The Treasury faces pressure to raise at least an extra Sh1.07 billion annually to finance a new salary deal for Cabinet secretaries, governors, MPs, MCAs and other top State officers that falls due this month, computations show, amid financial strain.
A new schedule of salaries and benefits for State officers fell due on July 1 in line with an August 9,2023 gazette notice by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC).
“Monthly remuneration structure for State officers in the Executive of the national government to be implemented in the financial year 2024/2025, with effect from July 1, 2024,” said the SRC in the notice.
Computations showed that the Treasury will require at least Sh10.92 billion annually to handle the new salaries and allowances—piling pressure on the Exchequer already hard hit by economic turmoil. Currently, the Treasury spends at least Sh9.85 billion annually on salaries and allowances of the top officers.
The gazette notice by the SRC said the salaries of Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi, the 22 Cabinet secretaries, Attorney General Justin Muturi, Head of Public Service Felix Koskei and Secretary to the Cabinet Mercy Wanjau will hit Sh990,000 each up from Sh957,000.
MPs and Senators, whose salary is Sh725,502 will have their pay increased to Sh739,600 monthly.
A governor‘s pay has been adjusted from Sh957,000 to Sh990,000 while that of an MCA’s will increase from Sh154,481 to Sh164,588 monthly.
Going by these new bands, it will require at least Sh744.83million to pay monthly salaries alone, exclusive of allowances that vary based on circumstances such as travel and engagements.
Compared to the current compensation terms, it means that the Treasury will need a minimum extra Sh30 million monthly or Sh360 million annually to meet the salaries.
SRC chairperson Lyn Mengich, however, said the implementation of the proposed salary raises is subject to “availability of funds and fiscal sustainability”.
The new salary increases come at a time when President William Ruto is facing public protests to cut wasteful spending and reduce the taxation burden on ordinary citizens.
Dr Ruto, whose administration has come under pressure for wasteful spending since the anti-tax protests started, directed for implementation of austerity measures that would involve expenditure cuts affecting all levels of government.
In an address to the nation following the deadly protests spearheaded by the Generation Z directed budget cuts on non-essential expenditures in his office, including travel, hospitality, and the purchase of motor vehicles to curb wastage of funds and plug a Sh346 billion hole occasioned by the now abandoned controversial Finance Bill 2024.
Under the new salary structure, the pay for the Speaker of the National Assembly and the Senate who currently earn Sh1,185,327 will rise to Sh1,208,362 while that of the Deputy Speakers of both Houses will hit Sh966,690, up from Sh948,261.
The Leader of the Majority and Minority Parties in both Houses will take home Sh800,019 while a Member of the National Assembly/Senate will earn Sh739,600 monthly. Majority/Minority in the National Assembly and Senate currently earn Sh784,768 while MPs in both Houses take home Sh725,502.
Apart from their hefty salaries, MPs and Senators are paid Committee Sitting Allowance with chairpersons earning Sh15,000 per sitting up to a maximum of Sh240,000 per month.
Vice-chairperson earns Sh12,000 per sitting up to a maximum of Sh192,000 per month while members take home 7,500 per sitting up to a maximum of Sh120,000 per month.
The salaries of the 51 Principal Secretaries, the Inspector General of Police, and the Director of the National Intelligence Service will now rise from Sh792,519 they earned last month to Sh819,844 at the end of this month.
The new salary for the Deputy Inspector-General, Kenya Police Service, Deputy Inspector-General, Administration, and Director of Criminal Investigations will be Sh684,233 up from the current Sh652,742.
At the devolved level of government, the salaries of the County Governor have been adjusted from Sh957,000 to Sh990,000 while that of the Deputy County Governor will rise from Sh652,742 to Sh684,233.
Member of the Executive Committee (CEC) salary will increase from Sh413,079 to Sh422,526 while that of the Speaker of the County Assembly has been adjusted from Sh537,003 to Sh549,283.
The Deputy Speaker will earn Sh247,943 up from Sh231,722 while pay for the Leader of the Majority/Minority Party who earns Sh191,324 will rise to Sh204,717.

https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/markets/real-estate/ncba-stanbic-tap-sh1-8bn-home-loans-4677102,"Tier I banks NCBA Group and Stanbic Bank Kenya borrowed Sh1.8 billion from the Kenya Mortgage Refinancing Company (KMRC) last year, adding to a growing list of firms tapping credit from the joint venture of the Treasury and private lenders, for onward lending.
Although both hold a 44 percent stake in KMRC, they had previously not tapped funding from the agency.
Stanbic Bank Kenya took up Sh936.6 million from KMRC in the year ended December 2023 while NCBA borrowed Sh860 million in the same period.
Safaricom Sacco took up Sh55.8 million in loans as borrowings by the three financial institutions helped lift KMRC’s loans and advances to all 12 primary mortgage lenders who form part of its shareholding to Sh8.4 billion from Sh6.75 billion in the previous financial year to December 2022.
The new borrowings signal the intent of the lenders to double down on mortgages with the KMRC facility supporting the issuance of single-digit home loans at 9.5 percent.
“NCBA had a Sh860.5 million unsecured facility raised from Kenya Mortgage Refinance Company (KMRC) taken in October 2023. The facilities are payable over a period of 12 years and had an outstanding principal balance as at 31 December 2023 of Sh860.1 million,” NCBA notes in its 2023 annual report.
Stanbic Bank Holdings, the parent of Stanbic Bank, did not make further disclosures on its facility at KMRC but highlights the facility as a key part of its strategy to support its borrowers.
“We supported our clients to overcome these headwinds by delivering personalised financing solutions through risk-based pricing, affordability reviews, facility restructures, and partnering with the government via KMRC to provide affordable housing solutions,” Stanbic Holdings stated.
Other lenders marked a reduction in outstanding facilities at KMRC having started payments on previously disbursed funds.
Absa Bank Kenya remains the largest primary mortgage lender borrowing from KMRC with an outstanding balance of Sh2.8 billion as of the end of December 2023 ahead of KCB which has a balance of Sh1.5 billion.
Other lenders with KMRC facilities and who co-own the company, include Cooperative Bank, Credit Bank, Housing Finance, Stima Sacco, Tower Sacco, Apstar Sacco (formerly Ukulima), and Unaitas Sacco. KMRC realised Sh390 million in interest income from mortgage lending in the year, a higher netting than Sh195.3 million in 2022.
The rise in interest income supported KMRC in realising a more than two-fold increase in profitability to Sh847.7 million from Sh321.3 million previously.
KMRC processed loan applications from 12 lenders and disbursed Sh9.6 billion in loans.
The company undertook interventions to support its lending activities against headwinds such as reduced disposable incomes including increasing the household income threshold from Sh150,000 to Sh200,000.
KMRC also changed the maximum loan threshold from Sh8 million to Sh10.5 million across the country in recognition of higher property prices.
“The review of these thresholds aims to reduce entry barriers for mortgages, push financing down market and thus, accelerate the uptake of affordable home loans across the country,” KMRC notes.",2024-07-02
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/explainer-the-appropriation-bill-and-why-it-matters-4677196,"This is a proposed law that reveals how revenues raised from taxes and fines are spent in a fiscal year by ministries and other agencies and details expenditure area such as wages and salaries, travel, hospitality, renovations and purchase of goods and services.
The Appropriation Bill, once approved by Parliament and the President, forms the basis for withdrawal of funds from the government’s main accounts or the Consolidated Fund for State operations.
The Appropriation Bill, which is now 2024 Appropriation Act after President William Ruto assented to the proposed law, will guide spending for the financial year that started on Monday or July 1 to June 30, 2025.
Without the Appropriation Bill, the government would not be able to spend a significant share of the previous year’s spending plan because the proposed law required withdrawing funds from the government’s main account. For instance, the government would only spend up to 50 percent of its previously approved budget in the absence of a new Appropriation Act.
What is the relationship between Appropriation Bill and Finance Bill?
The Appropriation Bill details areas of spending or the budget while the Finance Bill highlights new tax/revenue raising measures for each near fiscal year. While different, the two bills are tied at the hip as they are expected to be tabled together in Parliament and form the critical part of the annual budget statement presented by the National Treasury Cabinet Secretary every June.
Both bills also earned a new similarity this year as Kenyans protested new taxes while at the same time demanding a recalibration of spending to eliminate wasteful expenditures.
Why did President sign the Appropriation Bill into law amid public concerns over State spending?
Last week, President William Ruto assented to the Appropriation Bill, allowing the drawing of funds from government accounts for use in accordance to the approved spending plans by the National Assembly. He has, however, attempted to appease public concerns by authorising Treasury to work on spending cuts equivalent to Sh346 billion to cover the hole created by the expected withdrawal of the Finance Bill which contained new revenue raising measures.
President Ruto says cuts will cover his office including a slash on travel, hospitality and renovation budgets while the Treasury is expected to work with Parliament, the Judiciary and devolved units to cut discretionary spending to achieve deep budget cuts.
What would have happened if President Ruto refused to sign the Appropriation Bill?
Just like he refused to sign the 2024 Finance Bill following deadly protests, President Ruto would have equally rejected the Appropriation bill by writing to Parliament and instructing MPs to delete all clauses to the legislation as has been the case with proposed tax/revenue raising measures.
Unlike the Finance Bill where the State can rely on existing tax measures, the absence of a new Appropriation Act would have seen the government resort to a backup measure to access funding to support about 50 percent of the most recent approved spending plan.
The government would then reconstitute a new Appropriation Bill capturing changes to its spending plan to unlock full access to State accounts.
How does withdrawal of Financing Bill and signing of Appropriations Bill into law affect counties?
The Appropriation Bill is closely tied to the Division of Revenue Bill (Dora) which splits spending between the national and county governments. President William Ruto has proposed changes to the bill to capture expected spending cuts as the State rationalised spending across both levels of government.
Reverting Dora to Parliament means Counties are likely to face delays in receiving the first disbursements from the national government covering the 2024/25 financial year.
Like the Appropriation Bill, Dora holds the key to releasing funds to the 47 devolved units.
What happens to the Appropriation Act after the withdrawal of Finance Bill 2024?
The Treasury is expected to work with three arms of government to identify areas of discretionary spending which will either be withdrawn completely or trimmed with the goal of delivering at least Sh346 billion in lower expenditures for the 2024/25 financial year.
The proposed cuts will then be presented to Parliament and passed as the first supplementary budget estimates and will result in the Appropriation (Amendment) Bill no.1 of 2024 to be assented to by the President.
Before that, Parliament upon the resumption of regular sittings on July 26 will consider the proposed changes to the Division of Revenue Act which will in effect lower the counties equitable share from Sh401 billion at present.
The Appropriation (Amendment) Bill will form the basis for the revised 2024/25 government spending plan and will accommodate the Sh346 billion expected budget cuts.",2024-07-02
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/lifestyle/workplace/lay-off-staff-here-s-why-it-might-be-bad-for-your-business-4677070,"Earlier this year, an old story about former Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata went viral, posthumously praising him for taking a 50 percent salary cut rather than laying off staff.
Why would a story from 2013 suddenly make headlines? Likely because it provided such a stark contrast to current trends in North America, where employee layoffs are reaching levels not seen since the dot-com crash of the early 2000s.
The tech sector is being hit particularly hard. According to NPR, 2023 was ""a bloodbath for the tech industry, with more than 260,000 jobs vanishing.""
The cuts were blamed on a post-pandemic hiring binge and high inflation, which lowered consumer demand. Yet, the layoff trend continues into 2024. According to NPR, tech companies collectively laid off approximately 25,000 employees during the first four weeks of this year.
While some layoffs are inevitable due to basic economic cycles of recession and growth, they seem increasingly to be a method for CEOs to please shareholders by providing small, short-term bumps to a company's bottom line.
I think it's a short-sighted approach that reduces workers to data points and budget line items while ignoring the value of retaining employees over the long term, even when economic times are tough.
As Iwata said shortly after announcing his personal salary cut, ""If we reduce the number of employees for better short-term financial results, employee morale will decrease. I sincerely doubt employees who fear that they may be laid off will be able to develop software titles that could impress people around the world.""
The reflexive instinct among many CEOs today seems to be a throwback to the Jack Welch brand of management of the 1980s. Welch, the CEO of General Electric from 1981 to 2001, was known for being relentless in his pursuit of profit and his preferred method for achieving it: firing employees. According to a profile in the New Yorker, ""no single corporate executive in history has fired as many people as Jack Welch did.""
He pioneered the ""ranking and yanking"" method, in which he developed a grading scale for employees and fired the bottom 10 percent every year. His ruthless style was revered at the time. But his legacy is mixed, with much of his success attributed to financial chicanery. While his management style eventually lost favour in the 2000s and 2010s, CEOs' desire to prune workforces for short-term relief seems to be gaining new momentum.
But does it improve a company's bottom line in the long run? Even small cuts can quickly change a company's culture, causing employees to go into self-preservation mode and stifling innovation and creativity.
I know all too well how costly it can be to lose long-term, loyal staff due to extreme circumstances. Like countless other companies and not-for-profits, my charitable organisation had no choice but to lay off staff in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. It was one of the most difficult decisions I have ever made because I know the value employees at all levels can bring to an organization and the impact it would have on those employees' lives.
And it's a decision that rarely pays off in the long run. According to a report in Time, layoffs can often harm a company's financial performance over time. They don't consistently boost profits and can lead to lower employee engagement and customer service quality.
Conversely, while it doesn't always show up on a balance sheet, there are so many benefits to fostering an environment where employees feel safe and valued and want to stay with a company in the long term.
The majority of my team has been with our organisation for over ten years, with many in the 15- —to 20-year range, and I see the benefits of that dynamic every day. Employees who feel emotionally safe in their jobs provide a challenging function that is critical to decision-making and are loyal to their organisation, something that can only be earned through mutual trust.
Empowered employees work harder because they are invested in long-term outcomes. They know that they will be around long enough to see their contributions come to fruition and are not just on a one or two-year stop before looking for their next job.
They are also comfortable taking risks and driving innovation. Too often, companies achieve a level of success and become complacent and risk-averse, which ultimately leads them on a path to failure. That's why loyal and dedicated employees are so critical. They have the security to challenge leadership to continue innovating and driving impact or speak up when they see their leaders making potentially bad decisions.
A stable workforce also fosters better relationships with clients and suppliers, creating continuity and consumer confidence. A company constantly cutting and adding jobs cannot effectively maintain these relationships or conduct effective, long-term business planning.
Retaining an engaged workforce is particularly important in the era of ""quiet quitting,"" in which disengaged employees do the bare minimum level of work to keep themselves employed. This trend is not surprising given that so many employees are worried they could be cut at any moment. That insecurity can also fuel the tendency of employees to take on a side gig that will give them a softer landing if they are cut.
Instead of constantly trimming workforces to create short-term bumps, business owners — large and small — should consider the benefits of investing in employees and nurturing a secure, stable workforce. Finding other ways to tighten budgets and keep your workforce intact is a decision you will never regret.",2024-07-02
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/corporate/companies/supreme-court-declines-to-re-open-nbk-rancher-land-case-4677084,"The Supreme Court has declined to hear a dispute between the National Bank of Kenya (NBK) and a ranching company over a Sh2.8 billion parcel of land that was sold to recover a loan of Sh2.8 billion advanced 32 years ago.
A bench of five judges presided over by Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu (right) dismissed the application by Mwambeja Ranching Company Ltd saying the firm has not demonstrated the exceptional circumstances that would make the court review its decision made on October 6, 2023.
“Having carefully appraised the application, the responses thereto, and submissions by the parties, we find that the applicants have not demonstrated any special and compelling circumstances to warrant an oral hearing of the instant application, in exception to the provisions of Rule 31(1) of the Supreme Court Rules, 2020, which require that applications before this Court shall be determined by way of written submissions,” Judges Mwilu, Mohammed Ibrahim, Smokin Wanjala, Isaac Lenaola and William Ouko said.
The court said that the issues raised by the company were not substantial questions of law, whose determination would have a significant bearing on the public interest.
The dispute arose from a Sh30 million loan that was borrowed by Project Advisory Ltd in July 1992 and a related firm, Mwambeja Ranching Company who was the guarantor, charged its land Taita Taveta as security.
After failing to repay the loan even after agreeing that the amount be settled in installments, the borrower did not offset the amount forcing the bank to auction the property to Shimbaland Ranching Company Limited in 2012 for Sh305 million.
Attempts by the company to overturn the sale were dismissed by the High Court and Court of Appeal, forcing the Mwambeja Ranching to move to the Supreme Court.
The ranching company had complained that the property was undervalued but the court disagreed saying the ranchers’ valuer did not take into consideration that 13,000 acres of the 81,182 acres of the property were occupied by squatters.
The parties reached a compromise in July 1998, as they agreed that the debtor pays Sh22 million in three installments, the last of which was to be paid by December 31, 1998.",2024-07-02
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/opinion-analysis/columnists/communication-what-fueled-gen-z-riots-4676772,"Kenya is witnessing a wave of national outrage and riots, a clear indication that, among other things, the government's communication strategy has faltered on multiple fronts.
First, A notable failure that preceded the national outrage has been the government's lack of engagement with the voices of the people. When citizens feel unheard, their frustration grows, leading to a heightened sense of alienation and anger.
This lack of listening contributed significantly to the fever-pitch outrage observed across the country. Effective communication is a two-way street. It is not enough for leaders to simply broadcast their messages; they must also listen to the needs, interests, concerns, and expectations of their audience.
Secondly, the information disseminated to the public has consistently lacked the necessary depth and clarity to address the concerns of the people. When citizens feel that their needs and questions are not being met with transparent and substantial responses, it fuels uncertainty and fear, contributing to unrest and anger.
In times of crisis, citizens look to their leaders for clear, consistent, and resonant information. Yet, most of the messages by the government have not reflected the mood and desires of the people, possibly pointing to a situation where message drafters did not incorporate insights from strategic listening, if they had listened at all. The absence of insights-driven messaging has led to confusion and mistrust.
Thirdly, the Kenyan public has continually observed discrepancies between what is communicated and what is done. Inconsistency between messages and actions undermines the credibility of leadership, as people struggle to reconcile the differences between words and deeds.
Such contradictions not only erode trust but also provide fertile ground for rumors and misinformation, which can rapidly escalate into widespread dissent and protests.
The need for seasoned communication experts within government cannot be overstated. They facilitate strategic listening to the public by establishing channels of genuine engagement, allowing citizens to voice their concerns and feel heard. Strategic listening fosters a sense of inclusion and significantly reduce feelings of alienation and anger. When Kenyans believe their voices matter, they will be less likely to resort to protests.
It takes experienced communication professionals to craft messages that are clear, consistent, and resonate with the public. They understand the importance of strategic messaging that incorporates the needs, interests, concerns, and expectations of the people. They therefore, ensure that the information disseminated is coherent and trustworthy. This then reduces confusion and builds a foundation of trust between the government and its citizens.
What's more, one of the most critical aspects of effective communication is ensuring that actions align with words. Seasoned communication experts understand that for messages to be credible, they must be backed by concrete actions. They can advise government leaders on how to implement policies and initiatives that reflect their statements, ensuring consistency between what is said and what is done. This alignment is essential for building and maintaining trust.
When citizens see that their government not only listens to them but also acts on their feedback and concerns, they will likely be pacified. Moreover, an openness to acknowledge mistakes and correct them transparently can further enhance trust and cooperation, ultimately leading to a more stable and harmonious society.
In times of crisis, communication experts are crucial in managing the narrative and mitigating panic. They can anticipate public reactions and prepare strategic responses that address concerns before they escalate.
The recent riots underscore the devastating impact of poor communication. There is need for a regulatory framework governing the practice of public relations in Kenya. By instituting a law that mandates the engagement of seasoned communication professionals and sets standards for strategic listening, message crafting, and aligning actions with words, the Kenya government will ensure more reliable and effective communication.
A PR law will not only professionalise communication efforts but also protect public interest by fostering transparency, trust, and accountability.
This regulatory approach will serve as a safeguard against misinformation, enhance public confidence, and contribute to a more informed and stable society.",2024-07-02
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/us-warns-kenya-s-loan-costs-will-hit-education-health-4677130,"The US has warned that Kenya’s rising debt burden is undermining its ability to provide quality medical care and education to its services, shining the spotlight on expensive debt procured in the last decade partly from China.
Washington said elevated debt servicing costs are taking up a larger chunk of taxes, leaving little for development projects in social services and spurring the creation of decent jobs for the rising number of skilled youthful population.
“Kenya’s ability to adequately fund its social services [which include education, healthcare, and housing] and poverty reduction programmes is increasingly constrained by the cost of servicing its debt, partly due to the continued weakening of the local currency,” Office of the United States Trade Representative said in a newly published biennial report on the implementation of the African Growth and Opportunity Act.
The ballooning debt servicing expenses have in recent years overtaken expenditures on salaries and wages, administration, operation, and maintenance of public offices for the national government. This underlines the impact of commercial and semi-concessional loans that Kenya has contracted in the last decade to put up much-needed roads, bridges, power plants, and a modern railway line.
Latest disclosures from the Treasury, for instance, show debt repayment costs gobbled up an equivalent of three-quarters (75.47 percent) of taxes collected in 11 months of the just-ended financial year.
This is after the Treasury spent nearly Sh1.46 trillion on repaying interest and principal sums of Kenya’s domestic and foreign debt in a period when taxes amounted to Sh1.93 trillion.
The expenditure on debts was Sh342.98 billion more than Sh1.11 trillion, which went into paying salaries and allowances as well as administration, operation, and maintenance of offices for the government.
The increased expenditure on debt repayments has hit the hardest development projects, which received Sh261.15 billion directly, an equivalent of 10.04 percent of the total Sh2.6 trillion expenditure in the 11 months ended June 2024.
The concerns by Washington have come on the back of the US and her Western allies increasing scrutiny on secretive clauses in loans that China has offered African countries.
A study by AidData, a research laboratory at the College of William & Mary in the US, found that the terms of Beijing’s loan deals with developing countries were usually secretive and required borrowing nations such as Kenya to prioritise repayment to Chinese state-owned lenders ahead of other creditors.
The dataset, based on an analysis of loan agreements between 2000 and 2019, suggested the Chinese deals have clauses for “more elaborate repayment safeguards” than its “peers in the official credit market”.
The terms further “give Chinese lenders an advantage over other creditors”, the findings of the study suggested.
Kenya paid China Sh152.69 billion for interest and principal sums falling due in the financial year ended June 2024, 42.14 percent more than Sh107.42 billion in the year that ended June 2023.
The US says increasing debt obligations, corruption, and the lingering effects of the pandemic on household and company earnings have nearly paralysed Kenya’s march towards an “industrialising, middle-income country that provides a high standard of living to all its citizens by 2030, in a clean and secure environment”.
“The fourth Medium-Term Plan 2023-2027 provides an outline to implement Vision 2030 by instituting key legal and institutional requirements. However, the GOK will likely struggle to achieve its Vision 2030 goals on time due to insufficient funding, implementation delays, lingering effects of the Covid -19 pandemic, and corruption,” said the USTR office, equivalent to the Ministry of Trade, said in the Agoa report.",2024-07-02
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/markets/capital-markets/nse-beats-african-peers-in-half-year-as-shilling-strengthens-4676908,"The Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) posted the highest returns among African bourses in dollar terms in the first half of the year, buoyed by a stronger shilling and higher blue chip share prices that saw investor wealth at the market rise by Sh291 billion in the period.
The appreciation of the shilling by 21.74 percent against the dollar this year has handed foreign investors extra returns on top of the capital gains enjoyed on blue chip stocks at the NSE, helping them beat other markets where currencies have not performed as well against the greenback.
The Kenyan market had a return of 50.4 percent according to the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Index for the six months to June, beating Zimbabwe (34.4 percent), Mauritius (8.0 percent) and Morocco (6.8 percent) which were the other top African performers in the frontier and emerging markets indices.
South Africa, Côte d'Ivoire, Senegal and Tunisia had returns of between 2.9 and 5.9 percent, while Egypt and Nigeria’s six-month dollar returns were in the negative at -33 percent and -73 percent respectively.
The MSCI index is a key source of investment information for foreign investors, tracking the top stocks in selected countries based on their market capitalisation, liquidity and financial performance.
In Kenya, the MSCI tracks four blue chips—Safaricom, Equity Group, EABL and KCB Group— which together account for 62 percent of the NSE’s total market capitalisation of Sh1.71 trillion.
In the six months to June 2024, Safaricom’s stock price gained 24.5 percent to Sh17.30, while Equity’s was up by 25.6 percent to Sh42.25. EABL’s stock was up by 28.7 percent to Sh146.75, and KCB’s share gained 42.7 percent to Sh31.25.
These gains on the NSE’s four largest stocks helped it record a Sh271.62 billion increase in investor wealth in the period. The benchmark NSE 20 Share Index was up 10.3 percent to 1,656.50 points, while the all-inclusive NSE All Share Index gained 18.9 percent to 109.49 points.
In the comparative period in 2023, the NSE had shed Sh319.8 billion in market capitalisation, while the NSE 20 Share Index and the All Share Index were down by six percent and 16.1 percent respectively.
Foreign investors have meanwhile recorded net inflows of Sh749 million in the six-months to June 2024, compared with net outflows of Sh15.41 billion in the first half of 2023.
The sentiment around the market has however improved this year, mirroring the wider economy where investor jitters over the shilling and the country’s foreign debt sustainability have eased following the successful refinancing of the $2 billion 2014 Eurobond that matured last month.
Inflation has also eased since the beginning of the year, falling to 4.6 percent in June 2024 from 6.63 percent in December 2023.
For foreign investors, the weakening of the shilling and lack of access to dollars were the biggest concerns going into 2024, negatively affecting their participation and inflows into the market.
These fears eased from the second quarter of the year after the refinancing of the Eurobond and Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) led reforms to the forex interbank market.
The resolution of the dollar supply hitches resulted in the removal in April and May of restrictions placed on the Kenya stock market in 2022 by the MSCI and fellow global index provider Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) Russell Index.
The two index providers had put the NSE under watch after investors reported difficulties accessing dollars from the local forex market to repatriate dividends and proceeds of share sales.
These cautions to foreign investors discouraged inward foreign flows into the Kenyan market, while those already holding shares refrained from trading to avoid the hassle of seeking dollars in a difficult forex market.
The weakening of the shilling between 2022 and 2023 also discouraged trading, as investors sought to avoid exchange losses upon exit.
Foreign investors usually exchange their dollars for shillings when entering the market, and buy dollars when exiting for repatriation abroad.
If the shilling strengthens against the dollar between the period of entry and exit, they end up with an exchange rate gain since they would get more dollars for their shillings when buying hard currency for repatriation of gains abroad. On the other hand, a weakening shilling hands them an exchange loss on their investment.
A foreign investor entering the Kenyan market at the beginning of 2024 with an investment of $100,000 would have Sh15.65 million in shilling equivalent going by the exchange rate of Sh156.64 to the dollar at the beginning of January.
Even without a capital gain on their shares, the value of the investment in dollar terms had gone up to $120,800 by the end of June due to the appreciation of the shilling to Sh129.52 against the dollar in the period.",2024-07-02
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/tourism-earnings-hit-record-sh352bn-on-higher-arrivals-4676964,"Last year’s momentum is, however, likely to be hit by the ongoing countrywide youth-led demonstrations against proposed taxation measures among other grievances.
The demos, for instance, have led to cancellation of the annual Lewa Safari Marathon which was set to be held last weekend.Last year’s earnings are the highest since the country started tracking and making public annual tourism earnings, with the sector recovering from the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic four years ago.
Tourism is one of Kenya’s biggest foreign exchange earners, besides being a key employer with millions of direct and indirect jobs across the hospitality value chain.
Data shows that the period between July and September accounted for about 30 percent of the earnings made last year or Sh104.66 billion.
July to September has traditionally been the peak season for the tourism sector with millions of tourists drawn to the annual spectacle of the wildebeest migration at the famous Maasai Mara game reserve.
But despite the record high revenues, the shilling’s woes against major global currencies last year led to a reduction in expenditure as expressed in dollar terms.
The local unit closed the year at an official exchange rate of 155.47 units to the greenback compared to 123.52 units at the start of last year.
“Average per capita expenditure in US dollars decreased significantly. This suggests that although more people visited in 2023 compared to 2023, they spent less on average during their visits,” TRI says.
“This is partly attributed to the sustained depreciation of the shilling against the major currencies during the year.”
Last year’s growth also highlights the impact of a jump in the number of high-level global and continental meetings that the country hosted.
Some of the major global events that Kenya hosted last year included the second session of the United Nations Habitat Assembly held in Nairobi in June and the inaugural Africa Climate Summit in September.
Tourism was Kenya’s hardest-hit economic sector four years ago in the wake of the restrictions that were imposed to curb spread of the Coronavirus pandemic.
The curbs including domestic and international travel, cut annual earnings from the sector to Sh88.56 billion in 2020 which was a 70 per cent drop from Sh296.2 billion made the previous year.
In January this year, Kenya became a visa-free country meaning all visitors can get the crucial travel document upon arrival, a move that is likely to drive visitor numbers and earnings even higher this year.",2024-07-02
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/corporate/companies/no-thank-you-why-equity-ceo-declined-bonus-millions-4677256,"Equity Group CEO James Mwangi has rejected his bonus in a rare move for an industry that rewards its leaders handsomely in the wake of profit growth.
The banking mogul qualified for a bonus running into the tens of millions but failed to take up the additional pay after some of the lender’s subsidiaries failed to meet their key performance indicators, meaning that their employees did not qualify for a bonus.
This emerges in a period when banks have posted a surge in profits, triggering huge bonus payouts to their executives.
The banking industry has remained profitable in recent years and posted a profit before tax of Sh226.3 billion last year, albeit a slowdown from Sh244.1 billion in 2022.
For instance, the Kenyan subsidiary of the Equity saw its net profit contribution to the group drop to Sh26.7 billion from Sh33.4 billion previously with the unit being bogged down by high non-performing loans.
The group nevertheless saw a rise in the profit contribution from subsidiaries such as Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
“I declined my bonus in sympathy with our subsidiaries which didn’t qualify and I felt I owed them a duty to have helped them to also qualify for the bonus,” Mr Mwangi told shareholders last Wednesday.
In 2022, he pocketed Sh53 million in bonuses on his way to a total payout of Sh213.6 million in the period.
Last year, Mr Mwangi pocketed Sh158.8 million in total earnings, including a Sh106 million salary, Sh31.8 million in gratuity and Sh4.7 million in non-cash benefits. He is set to earn a further Sh511.2 million from the bank’s dividend distribution off his stake or 127.8 million shares in the lender.
Mary Wamae, who recently retired as the executive director, earned a bonus of Sh5.5 million on her way to Sh69 million in total earnings in 2023.
Other members of Equity’s board who serve in a non-executive capacity do not earn salaries or bonuses and are instead compensated through fees and sitting allowances. Equity Group chairman Isaac Macharia said Mr Mwangi’s bonus is usually premised on the performance of the entire group while that of management and staff in subsidiaries is calculated from the performance of each unit.
“The executive at the group level is compensated on the basis of the group performance and the subsidiaries on the basis of the subsidiary performance. In view of this background, the group reviewed the performance of the Group CEO and he had met the criteria for the bonus,” he noted.
“The Group CEO felt that one of the major subsidiaries had not met the budget that he had promised the board and he felt that, if employees in this subsidiary were not going to get rewards, it was not in line with his principles to accept a bonus payment.”
Mr Mwangi’s remuneration package comprises core fixed elements, including a base salary, pension and other benefits. He is also eligible to participate in the group’s bonus scheme, which is anchored on the achievement of key performance indicators (KPIs) but he does not qualify to earn fees or sitting allowances.
Equity’s board developed a compensation and rewards policy based on a model of ‘shared prosperity’ which it leverages to attract, develop and retain talent. The first of such rewards was paid out in 2022.
The rewards are either long or short term, with the former relating to salaries, benefits and bonuses. The long-term rewards include pension and the employee share ownership plan (Esop). Last year Mr Mwangi helped Equity post a Sh41.98 billion net profit, albeit the performance being a 6.4 percent slowdown from 2022 and its provisioning for bad loans more than doubled to Sh35.2 billion.
The bank nevertheless retained its dividend for the year at Sh4 per share.",2024-07-02
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/markets/capital-markets/nse-sheds-sh63bn-in-two-weeks-as-investors-ruffled-by-protests-4677236,"The Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) has shed Sh63.1 billion in investor wealth over the past two weeks, signalling investors’ concern over the impact of anti-government protests on the economy.
The shilling has also seen slight volatility over the past week on uncertainty over the government’s spending plans following the withdrawal of the Finance Bill 2024, and the prospects of higher borrowing which is likely to keep interest rates elevated in the near term.
President William Ruto has failed to appease a spontaneous youth protest movement despite having abandoned plans for tax hikes that triggered the unrest two weeks ago.
These stocks are highly exposed to institutional and foreign investors who dominate trading at the NSE, meaning their share price movements tend to closely reflect the prevailing sentiments at the market.
“The market is correlated with the political temperature in the country as we have seen before, for instance, in March last year when protests caused a slowdown in trading and prices. We are starting to see a similar trend now as the protests continue,” said Ronnie Chokaa, an analyst at AIB AXYS Africa, a city-based investment bank.
“On the foreign desk, which has had net inflows over the past three months, there is a slowdown in market participation, going down to a low of 12.5 percent on Monday.”
The souring sentiments in the past two weeks have come in the middle of an otherwise positive period for a bourse that has made double-digit gains in the year-to-date.
Since the turn of the year, market capitalisation has gone up by Sh268 billion or 18.7 percent, while foreign investors turned net buyers in the first half of the year with net inflows of Sh749 million, compared with net outflows of Sh15.41 billion in the first half of 2023.
President Ruto has since dropped the proposed tax increases - but the demonstrations have morphed into a nationwide movement against corruption, police brutality and misgovernance.
The scale of demonstrations were yesterday smaller than last week’s, but chaotic scenes were witnessed in the cities like Nairobi, Nakuru and Mombasa.
Dr Ruto has directed the Treasury to come up with ways to cut spending to fill a budget gap left by the withdrawal of the tax plans, and also said more borrowing would be required.
Many businesses remained closed in the Nairobi city centre yesterday, while flow of transport to western Kenya was disrupted after protesters barricaded the Nairobi-Nakuru highway at Kangemi.
The markets are also reacted to uncertainty over the government’s fiscal plans going forward, especially over the size of the budget deficit.
When signing the Appropriations Bill, the President instructed the Treasury to prepare a supplementary budget to cut expenditure by Sh346 billion, to cover for the expected loss of revenue following his withdrawal of the Finance Bill.
Ideally, this would help the government keep its earlier projected budget deficit of Sh597 billion—to be filled by borrowing— unchanged. In a live TV interview on Sunday, Dr Ruto said that the government will borrow Sh1 trillion in the current fiscal year, raising questions over the size of the expected budget cut, if any.
“For the shilling, uncertainty around the government’s funding gap now that the Finance Bill has been withdrawn is a concern. There’s also a question of whether the country will access the remainder of IMF funding, which is conditional on meeting the revenue measures that were being driven by the Bill,” said Wesley Manambo, an analyst at Standard Investment Bank.
“The shilling might see volatility until we get clarity on the borrowing plan.”
The official exchange rate of the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) shows that last week the shilling was on the back foot against the dollar, depreciating by 0.7 percent to exchange at Sh129.52 to the US currency on Friday from Sh128.55 at the start of the week.
It regained some ground on the dollar on Monday, appreciating to Sh128.89, before gaining further to trade at Sh128.57 yesterday afternoon.
Higher state borrowing is likely to keep interest rates on government securities high in the near term, which also means that the cost of private sector credit will remain elevated given that the government’s risk-free cost of borrowing is seen as a floor for interest rates in the economy.",2024-07-02
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/lifestyle/art/visual-arts/waruguru-navigates-place-and-spaces-at-the-venice-biennale-4677060,"“Being chosen for such a long and important event is really humbling,” said 30-year-old Waruguru.
The exhibition’s curator, she believes, was making a statement that one does not need a massive career or a great deal of resources to feature at the Biennale. “It shows that what is most important is dedication to practice.”
The invitation happened rather quickly for Waruguru. Adriano Pedrosa, the curator of the 2024 Venice Biennale, had been travelling around the world in 2023 conducting studio visits and meeting artists whose practice interested him.
However, when he visited Kenya in 2023 Waruguru was at a two-year arts residency at the Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten (National Academy of Fine Arts) in the Netherlands. Fortunately, they met later in the year in Sao Paulo city, Brazil, Pedrosa’s home country and where she was showcasing her textiles at the Videobrazil Biennale.
Then in October Waruguru received an invitation to participate, quite short notice for such an enormous exhibition. However, she managed to conceptualise and prepare new art pieces in time for the opening.
Waruguru has previously visited the Venice Biennale, but attending the inaugural week in April 2024 as a participating artist was an extraordinary and exciting experience, she said, especially after focusing for months on making the work and how the installation would happen.
“It is incredible how many people care [about art] and want to participate in these events,” said Waruguru.
Waruguru is known for minimalist paintings on textiles, especially everyday fabrics like cotton. “I want to create a closeness to my work instead of it being intimidating or bravado,” she explained.
Her practice explores ideas of home, time and weaving through places, often drawn from her experiences of living abroad which invoked a sense of displacement and being out of touch with her roots.
“I was interested in how to communicate ordinary life and family, and textiles were an immediate way to talk about this,” she said.
Typically, she uses old bedsheets, kangas, sheer curtains and other household fabrics directly related to Kenya. As part of building rituals around her practice, Waruguru employs organic paints made from hibiscus tea, turmeric, saffron and other natural materials. Her art medium draws from common kitchen ingredients and ‘memoryscapes’ of childhood such as her mother treating colds with a ginger-turmeric mix.
Waruguru’s installation at the Arsenale venue is called Incomprehensible Weather in the Head. Eight panels of white cloth, between four to eight feet long, hang from the ceiling and occasionally sway in a gentle, calming movement. They are painted with abstract splashes of colour, florals and squiggles, with embroidery, beads and netting.
“I’m happy to put work out there using local materials and beadwork made by local women artisans,” said Waruguru. Behind the art-making, she says, is pride in the material culture of Kenya, its history, its origins “and what’s going on with it.”
Her art explores a particular space and geography but from different perspectives, “knowing that it will be different with each person who interacts with my work.”
A recent inspiration was the book Vagabonds by Nigerian author, Eloghosa Osunde, short stories about different vagrants in Lagos and which inspired the title of her Venice Biennale artwork. Waruguru was struck by how the novel’s characters negotiate the same city through different perceptions and merge spirituality into everyday life.
Incomprehensible Weather in the Head refers to “navigating many spaces all at once, through many motions, and not quite being able to grasp everything,” she said. The overall theme of the 60th Biennale, Foreigners Everywhere, was particularly meaningful to her, having lived in different countries and traversed through many new spaces.
Born and raised in Kenya, Waruguru was interested in art as a child but it was not taught as a subject in primary school. Fortunately, an interior designer and friend of her mother noticed her love of drawing.
“She gave me some art classes and from there I was obsessed with it,” she said, adding that art has saved her life in many ways. “It keeps me curious, keeps me learning and gives me purpose in a much bigger way than I can express in words.”
Her advice to young people interested in pursuing an art career is, “If it’s something you really care deeply about, keep at it. Today there are more options for creative careers than there has ever been.”
Waruguru's work has been exhibited in Kenya, France, the Netherlands and the US. She is preparing for a solo show at Circle Art Gallery, Nairobi later in 2024 and group shows in the Netherlands and Los Angeles.",2024-07-02
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/corporate/companies/kenya-airways-debt-to-kaa-grows-to-sh6-3bn-4677016,"The Kenya Airports Authority (KAA) is going hard on Kenya Airways (KQ) over Sh6.3 billion debt the airline owes it and which has been accumulating over the years.
In the year to June 2023, KQ’s debt to KAA increased by Sh1.6 billion to hit Sh5.89 billion, while the Kenya Airfreight Handling Limited -a subsidiary of the airline- owed the airports manager Sh463 million, notes Auditor-General Nancy Gathungu.
KAA charges airlines fees for various services including for parking aircraft, with the national carrier among its major clients operating from the various facilities including the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport.
“Effectively bringing the company indebtedness to Sh6,359,818,196 or 42 percent. It was also observed that the balance owed has not been attracting any interest to protect the interests of the authority (KAA) neither has there been recoveries during the year,” Ms Gathungu notes in her latest report on KAA.
While KQ did not make any payment to KAA, the airports authority indicated that it has entered into a payment plan with the national carrier, whose total debts now constitute 42 percent of the Sh15.18 billion owed to KAA.
KAA says the payment plan was entered into following talks facilitated by the ministries of transport and the National Treasury.
“(With regards to) debts relating to Kenya Airways including their subsidiaries Kenya Airfreight Handling and African Cargo Handling Limited, the authority is pursuing the debts through negotiation with the support from the parent ministry and National Treasury. The customer has provided a payment plan which we intend to ensure is adhered to,” KAA management stated. KQ itself owes the authority Sh5.9 billion, after the obligations rose by Sh1.6 billion in the year to June 2023.
“This constitutes 38.8 percent of the total trade receivables, an increase of Sh1,604,224,628 from Sh4,292,490,389 as at 30 June, 2022 to Sh5,896,715,017 as at 30 June, 2023,” Ms Gathungu notes.
The Sh6.3 billion that KQ owes KAA constitutes just 4.3 percent of all the liabilities KQ had in its books by end of December 2023, pointing to the financial difficulty facing the national carrier that continues to rely on government support to stay afloat.
This year, the airline is expected to repay Sh24.7 billion to its creditors, after spending Sh39 billion last year.
It closed 2023 with borrowings totaling Sh148 billion, which was a Sh9 billion increase from the total borrowings of Sh139 billion in 2022.",2024-07-03
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/lifestyle/personal-finance/financial-wellness-coach-s-lessons-for-secure-retirement-4677034,"Dolly Sagwe, a financial wellness coach and the co-founder of Prosper Path runs the numbers. If you are 30 years old now, and want to retire at 40, and you live to 90 years, you still have to finance 50 years of your life.
The numbers don’t lie, and being a financial accountant, she is right on the money.
“Retirement has moved from what the government says is the retirement age, to what you can comfortably afford at a certain age,” she says.
She speaks the money language in absolutes—at once an indigenous speaker, but also a translator.
We are at the Wine and Bar in Nairobi's Loresho, and here she recalls how her mother, a retired banker now 77 years old, bought cryptocurrency at 70.
“She taught me all I know,” she says.
She talks about the old and the young, the best preparation for your 70s is in your 20s. Retirement, she seems to say, is wasted on the old the same way youth is wasted on the young.
What is one key lesson you’ve learned about money?
It’s all a mindset game. There are conversations and training you need to acquire a certain mindset that enables you to continue to earn value from your product [in this case, your money]. Without the right mindset, you can easily lose it, even if it is your inheritance.
I have also learned that you need to track how much money you make passively versus actively. Ask yourself: Can I use plant active income somewhere to generate passive income? If you started working at the age of 24, by 34 it should give me different options. Your success should be measured by how much you earn passively.
What is the right mindset?
Understanding of who you are. The first investment is yourself—what is your value system? And what value do you have? Is the value you give out increasing, or is it stagnant? Essentially, a growth mindset. But also understanding the elements of growth—the relationships and conversations you have, and the content you consume.
What conversations are people currently having on money?
How to run my second career. Getting into a second career, where one retires from, say, accounting, and goes back to school to study, say, psychology, calls for big expenditure. I invest in the transition because it is what the next 10 years require.
And it is not just the older employees. Young people, especially in the gig economy, are working day and night, switching careers to get pay raises, and retiring at 30, so they can live off passive income. The government says the retirement age is 60, but they say no, I will work to earn a certain amount of money, invest it, and do what I want to.
Research shows that because of advancements in medicine and technology those in their 20s are likely to live until 100. That means if the government puts the retirement age at 60, you still have to finance 40 years of your life. I usually ask young people, ‘At what age do you want to stop actively working?’ Then I ask them, ‘How old is your oldest relative?’ If this person died at 103, and you want to retire at 40, what is your plan for 60 years?
What are the pitfalls you need to avoid in retirement?
Making large purchases when your income is fixed and low. Some would say, 'I am now retired; let me get the car I have always wanted.' This will eat into your money. The other mistake is getting into businesses you don’t know much about, just because you’ve seen others do it. And lastly, not to stay active and healthy. Before retirement, one is very active; but after retirement, activities reduce, and therefore you have to be intentional about your health.
How does the relationship with money change when one is employed vis-à-vis when one is retired?
The assumption is that we retire and things are thick, but some retirees have passive income higher than what they were earning in employment. Those who planned for their retirement have either equal to or greater income than they used to earn, and what they spend on is different. Their expenditure is based on health, wealth, and time. For instance, spending around social engagements and building social capital because retirement is quite lonely.
How do you remain financially sane in retirement?
Don’t go into ventures you do not understand well. Someone recounted how her mother bought a matatu after retirement, an investment in an industry that she [the mother] knows little about. When you receive a lump sum, don’t start spending or adding expenses to your lifestyle. Save and invest it, and then spend the interest from it.
Is there a popular industry where most retirees invest?
Real estate. It is easy for people that age to translate, “I will build a house, and rent will come.” Besides real estate, women also prefer cash items like mutual funds, where they earn interest. A popular investment vehicle is government bonds.
For men, retirement is a time to sit and relax. For women, it is their time to travel and experience the world. How do the two disparate genders ensure financial harmony in retirement?
These needs start way before retirement. The hope is that throughout the journey, you start having conversations about money that allow you to build together and do what makes you happy. What does your particular picture of retirement look like? Align the needs that require both of you to grow together, and then allow each of you to live a full life.
What do the two different sexes splurge on?
The Covid pandemic was a hint of retirement. For women, especially in the initial years, expenditure is around the home because guests will start coming—getting the home ready for guests. The sofas, dishes you’ve always wanted, et al. Later, it is travel. They want to go out with their children, husbands, and friends. To see the world.
The popular imagination is that retirement is about going home, to the village. But the modern retiree has spent most of his/her days in the city. What happens then?
The key question is what is home vis-à-vis where you come from? When you have worked in a town for 30 years, where is home? Is it not where you understand and have built networks? This is different from where you come from.
My mom is 77 and she retired almost 30 years ago, but she is still in the city because, by the time she retired, she had spent more time in the capital city than upcountry. Don’t start a business you know nothing about, similarly, don’t move to a place you know nothing about.
But if you cannot afford to live in the city, return to where you come from and make it work. Assess your situation.
How has watching your mom's retirement influenced your journey?
She taught me everything I know about money. She was a banker for over 30 years. In her career, she saw people taking a loan at 10 percent and putting it into government bonds, which gave out 60 percent in interest, making a 50 percent return on investment. She understood early how to play that, and I realised that what you need to work on is the passive income. When bitcoin was new and at $1,700, my mother bought it. She was 70 then. It is all about mindset.
What about loneliness in retirement and how does it impact financial decisions since men die almost seven years earlier?
It is about your social capital. Have people around you. Women are everywhere: in church groups, saccos, chamas, former colleagues meeting for tea, and alumni’s meetings. The lonely ones are easily taken advantage of, especially in relationships. It also boils down to how you were raised. Are they responsible? And the mindset too. You can have plenty of money and you become frustrated.
Dependency is rife in retirement, especially when it comes to reverse black tax—where children depend on their parents. How does one safeguard their pension and assets?
It's unfortunate when it gets there. Train a child as they should grow, and be clear on the child being able to earn and produce. Even if they do take the land after you die, they will still get to a point where they are stuck. It’s about the mindset.
What’s the one thing that keeps coming up in retirement?
Where do I invest? It’s a good question to keep asking experts. The answer to that question depends on the stage of life you are in—are you in real estate, maybe you have enough money to build? You ask the question, but whoever answers should ask, what’s your season? Your season should determine your investments.
How do you handle succession in old age?
I believe in leaving everything in a trust—the proceeds from the assets to be divided among your successors. It becomes a property in trust, and thus for them, it is to figure out the best way to get as much as possible from said property.
How does that work?
Go to an expert. Say, 'I have assets, that I want to protect from different people, not necessarily my children'. Then train your children how to produce from said assets and leave instructions on how it shall be distributed.
If retirement were a currency, what would you attribute to it?
Cryptocurrency. Because it can rise in value and also drop in value vis-à-vis the dollar which could remain stagnant for a long time. Retirement can stretch upwards, and if you have the smarts, you can sit with financial experts and consolidate and watch as it grows. But if you don’t know much about it, it can easily plummet.",2024-07-02
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/corporate/companies/mwananchi-credit-blocked-from-selling-seized-lorries-4676894,"Mwananchi Credit has failed in its bid to lift a court order blocking the microlender from selling two lorries belonging to two traders, which were seized over a disputed loan.
High Court judge Kizito Magare upheld the injunction issued by a Milimani magistrate blocking the microlender from selling the two lorries -- a Mercedes truck and a Scania lorry, which were attached in March 2021.
The court was informed that Peter Kamau Githua and Elizabeth Wanjiku borrowed a loan of Sh2.5 million and charged the lorries as security. The traders said they had repaid Sh3 million but the lender was still demanding more money.
Justice Magare noted that the traders had pleaded and demonstrated that it was likely that the entire debt had been paid.
Secondly, the judge said, Mwananchi Credit is not a mortgagor as the chattel mortgage (the loan used to purchase the vehicles and which served as security of the loan) was not registered, making the attachment void and the amount claimed fictitious.
“There is also a contention that a sum of Sh9,254,767 is outstanding as per the records held by the appellant (Mwananchi). I am not a student in sorcery and magic, but I am unable to fathom the labyrinth or mathematical permutations and flagrant distortion of figures that caused a sum of Sh2,500,000 to become Sh9,254,767.24 despite payment of three million shillings,” the judge said.
The court was informed that the repossession of one of the lorries was made in a gangster-like move.
“If we are to let our microfinance fall into the same school as the shylocks, the court will be missing its duty,” said the judge.
The microlender moved to the High Court after the lower court blocked the sale arguing that there was a valid claim and that it had been registered.
But the traders maintained that they had paid all amounts due.
Ms Wanjiku said in an affidavit that one of the lorries was involved in an accident but they continued paying the loans.
In March 2021, the lender attached one of the vehicles and threw out the driver on the transit claiming a balance of Sh9.2 million.
Senior principal magistrate D.W. Mburu then granted the injunction in October 2021, pending the determination of the case.",2024-07-02
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/markets/capital-markets/packaging-firm-skol-applies-to-list-on-the-nairobi-bourse-4676804,"Packaging solutions provider, Shri Krishana Overseas Ltd (Skol), has applied for listing on the Growth Enterprise Market Segment (Gems) of the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE), official documents revealed.
Gems is a segment for small and medium-sized companies that enables them to raise capital and accelerate their growth within a regulatory environment. The segment offers companies flexible listing requirements in recognition of the company’s growth phase.
Fillings show that Nairobi-based Skol targets to enter the market via listing by introduction but subject to approval by the Capital Markets Authority (CMA).
Listing by introduction happens when a company takes its existing shares and lists them on an exchange to raise capital at a later date when required.
The planned listing by Skol is earmarked for August this year in an arrangement where Synesis Capital is the lead transaction advisor while MWC Legal is serving as the legal advisor.
Aside from the constraint of not being able to raise capital, listing by introduction is often perceived to have the advantage of providing a company with a much broader base of shareholders, improved liquidity as well as enhanced profiling given the visibility provided by the exchange. Companies that go to market via introduction are, however, able to raise capital further down the road.
Kenya’s last initial public offering (IPO) was in 2015 when property investment fund ILAM Fahari I-Reit was listed on the NSE after raising Sh3.6 billion.
The CMA recently published revised rules that would allow more companies to list on the bourse to encourage additional IPOs and reverse a six-year drought in transactions.
As part of the radical changes, the regulator has struck out an earlier rule that restricted IPO listings to public companies limited by shares and registered under the Companies Act. A public company limited by shares is a legal entity that is separate and distinct from its members and directors or management.
The regulator also relaxed a rule on the profitability of firms seeking to go public in the main investment market segment. Currently, the law provides that an issuer must have declared profits after tax attributable to shareholders in at least three of the last five completed accounting periods to the date of the offer.",2024-07-02

https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/markets/commodities/mystery-of-russian-fertiliser-cargo-that-didn-t-reach-kenya-4676192,"A consignment of 564 tonnes of fertiliser donated to Kenya by Russia last year disappeared in the high seas, new details show, pointing to a possible theft of the agricultural input.
The missing consignment was part of the 34,400 tonnes of raw fertiliser material Kenya received from Russia during its charm offensive to win the backing of African countries in its deadly battle against Ukraine.
The raw fertiliser material was expected to be used in tripling the production of ready-to-use product for distribution to farmers across the country, notes Auditor-General Nancy Gathungu in her latest report.
The public auditor says the missing consignment did not arrive at the port of Mombasa, suggesting it left Russia, but never arrived in Kenya.
“NCPB (National Cereals and Produce Board) received 33,835.9 metric tonnes hence a short landing of 564.1 metric tonnes from the 34,400 metric tonnes of fertiliser raw materials donated from Russia. The cause of the short landing was not explained,” notes Ms Gathungu in an audit on NCPB.
The 564 tonnes of the missing raw fertiliser would have produced 1,643 tonnes of ready-to-use fertiliser, valued at Sh197 million at the market price of Sh6,000 for a 50kg bag.
The Russian Embassy in Kenya in August last year noted that the 34,400 tonnes that Moscow donated to Nairobi would produce 100,200 tonnes of the finished product after reformulation.
“More than 34,000 tonnes of fertiliser donated to Kenya by the Russian Uralchem-Uralkali Group are now being reformulated to produce 100,200 tonnes of fertiliser. This will help Kenya a lot to get a good harvest this year,” the Embassy stated on August 3, following the landing of the input in the country.
Upon reformulation, the fertiliser (34,400 tonnes) would have a Sh12 billion market value. Russia’s donation came amid increasing prices of the input globally.
The price of fertiliser soared in the wake of Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, as sanctions imposed on Russia limited availability of natural gas, a main input for nitrogen fertilisers such as ammonia and urea.
This hit farmers financially while some, especially in Africa, stopped using fertiliser altogether, hampering yields and deepening a food crisis.
Since then fertiliser prices have eased as natural gas prices have come down, but Europe’s fertiliser industry is still struggling as Russian imports take a bigger share of the market.
The price of a tonne of fertiliser shot to peak at Sh87,510 in 2022 when the Russia-Ukraine war broke, but eased at Sh68,849 last year. Producing 51.9 million tonnes annually, Russia ranks as the third largest fertiliser producer globally, trailing the US which produces above 54 million tonnes, and India with an annual production of 52.6 million tonnes. It is not clear at what point the 564 tonnes of fertiliser donated to Kenya by Russia went missing.
The fertiliser disappeared in the middle of claims that NCPB distributed fake fertiliser through a subsidy programme. Eighty percent of legislators present in Parliament voted in favour of removal of Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Mithika Linturi for allegedly flouting constitutional provisions on integrity and the prudent use of public resources, according to the motion in the National Assembly.
The minister is alleged to have approved the “procurement and distribution of fake fertiliser.” He escaped the impeachment.
Yesterday, Mr Linturi did not respond to requests for comment on the whereabouts of the missing fertiliser, which could be applied on between 15,000 and 30,000 acres of land, at the rate of 50kg/acre to 100kg/acre.
The Auditor-General also notes that the NCPB has not produced a breakdown of costs associated with the raw material of fertiliser, including shipping cost, transportation cost from the port to the granulator and handling costs. The costs would shed light on how much the NCPB spent to have a 50kg bag of the finished product.
“In the circumstances, the accuracy and completeness of the fertiliser granulation costs and the quantities of the various fertilisers granulated could not be confirmed,” Ms Gathungu says.
The government continues to maintain the importance of the fertiliser subsidy programme, committing about a fifth of the budget to the agriculture sector to the programme.
“To attain food and nutrition security, I propose an allocation of Sh54.6 billion for various programmes under this sector. This includes: Sh10 billion for the Fertiliser Subsidy Programme,” Treasury Cabinet Secretary Njuguna Ndung’u said while delivering the current financial year’s budget speech.",2024-07-01
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/murkomen-on-the-spot-for-delay-lowering-expressway-toll-fees-4676186,"The Kenyan government has delayed lowering Nairobi Expressway toll charges despite the falling inflation and strengthening of the shilling against the dollar, boosting the earnings of the Chinese firm that owns the road.
The Business Daily has established that the Ministry of Roads and Transport is sitting on an advisory from the Kenya National Highways Authority (Kenha) to lower the toll charges that were reviewed upwards on January 1.
The highways authority, which regulates the expressway operations, reckons that the strengthening of shilling and lower inflation should trigger a drop in the toll charges.
“We had mentioned the need to reduce toll fees to the PS,” said a top official at Kenha, who sought anonymity given the sensitivity of the matter.
“The adjustment could be at the CS’s whims and they (the contractor) have no control. It is the CS who can gazette.”
The current toll charges were based on inflation at 6.85 percent and the shilling at Sh143.75 against the dollar.
The shilling has since February extended gains against the dollar as Kenya’s settlement of the Eurobond that matured in June calmed investors, pushing the local currency to Sh129.50 from Sh157.32 at the start of the year.
Inflation also dropped to a 44-month low of 4.6 percent in June compared to 6.6 percent in December, bringing the cost of living measure to within the State’s target range of 2.5 percent to 7.5 percent.
After the adjustment of toll fees in January, motorists driving saloon cars from Mlolongo to Nairobi Westlands saw their user fees increase by 38.9 percent to Sh500 from the rate of Sh360 that had been set earlier in April 2022.
Driving the same vehicle from Westlands to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) costs Sh410, an increase of more than a third from Sh300. The toll for the distance between Museum Hill and the JKIA.
Motorists had hoped for lower rates to be announced from July 1 in line with macro-economic changes.
The law gives the Cabinet Secretary for Transport the powers to adjust the toll rates downwards if inflation falls and the shilling strengthens as part of the public private partnership (PPP) that the country inked with the Chinese contractor — Moja Expressway, a subsidiary of China Road and Bridge Construction (CRBC).
On December 19, Transport Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen issued a Kenya Gazette notice announcing the higher charges that took effect on January 1.
The reluctance to reduce the toll rates has parallels with the rocket-and-feather pricing where upstream changes are adjusted upwards at rocket-speeds while the lower prices come down at the pace of a feather.
Monday, Mr Murkomen did not respond to requests for comments via calls and text messages.
The State opened a window allowing the Chinese company to adjust the Nairobi Expressway toll charges annually based on inflation in fees that will be paid in dollars. The inaugural toll charges were based on the dollar trading at Sh103.79 and reviewed based on inflation and the rate of the shilling to the dollar. This technically means that the toll charges are dollar-based and will cushion the Chinese operator from exchange rate losses. It has since reviewed the rates upwards twice.
The Chinese firm is expected to earn an estimated Sh106.8 billion profit for the 27 years it will own the double-decker road.
The expressway involves a four-lane and six-lane dual carriageway within the existing median of Mombasa Road/Uhuru Highway/Waiyaki Way and 11 interchanges or exits and entry routes that act as toll ramps.
The toll charges are forecast to generate Sh302.5 billion revenues, which will offer the Chinese firm an annual profit of Sh3.9 billion.
At Sh3.9 billion, CRBC’s forecast annual earnings from the double-decker road dwarfs the profits of the majority of firms listed on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) — underlining the outsized cash the expressway will generate over the 27 years.
Toll fees were introduced in the late 1980s but were scrapped in the mid-90s in favour of the roads maintenance levy currently charged at Sh18 per litre of petrol and diesel.
The return of toll fees is the result of using private investments in State infrastructure to build roads, energy plants and housing, with investors recouping their cash from charging user fees.
Kenya is seeking to maintain the pace of spending on new infrastructure with funding from private backers while reducing borrowings and the budget deficit.
The government is planning for more highways to be constructed through the PPP arrangement, depending on the success of the two.
Toll fees that will start upon completion of the two highways will add to the Sh18 per kilometre fuel levy currently charged for maintaining Kenya’s roads.",2024-07-01
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/ruto-austerity-doublespeak-more-debts-or-spending-cuts-4676168,"Despite earlier directing the Treasury to cut Kenya’s total spending for the current financial year by Sh346 billion, President William Ruto on Sunday claimed borrowing by the State would increase by Sh1 trillion following the withdrawal of the Finance Bill 2024.
“We have dropped the Finance Bill. What does that mean? It means we have gone back almost two years. It means that this year, we are going to borrow Sh1 trillion to be able to run our government,” said Dr Ruto.
Interestingly, even after saying that borrowing would increase, from the initial target of Sh597 billion to Sh1 trillion, the President still claimed that the rejected Finance Bill would have huge consequences on certain expenditures the government had lined up.
“It means we will not confirm the JSS (Junior Secondary School) teachers, 46,000 of them; it means we cannot support the farmers with Sh2 billion for us to make sure that farmers get a fair return of Sh50 per kilo per milk; it means cannot sort out the coffee debt; it means we cannot support the cherry,” said the President.
Other victims of the decision by the government to shelve the finance billion from widespread protests include sugar cane farmers in Mumias, said the head of state. He added that Kenya will continue importing potatoes, to the chagrin of local producers.
Additionally, in the same interview, President Ruto agreed with the push to scrap the controversial offices of the First Lady as well as those of the spouses of Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua and Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi.
But with the conflicting statements, the President has only added more confusion on the budget for the fiscal year starting this month.
The budget is a balancing act. The expenditure and revenue sides have to balance. On the expenditure side, is the spending by the national government (Executive, Parliament, and Judiciary) and the 47 counties. And on the revenue side, there are taxes, non-tax revenues, grants, and loans.
If the President increased the borrowing target to Sh1 trillion, the country’s total spending would remain at Sh3.997 trillion. Increasing the borrowing by Sh403 billion to Sh1 trillion would mean a Sh57 billion increase in the size of the budget.
But on June 28, when President Ruto passed the Appropriations Bill, which he said would “guarantee continuity of government operations, especially in providing critical services,” he had a different perspective. He did not talk of the government increasing borrowing, but he talked of reducing expenditure including by his office.
“I have therefore assented to the Appropriations Bill 2024 and instructed the National Treasury to immediately prepare supplementary estimates to reduce expenditure by the amount of revenue that was expected to be generated by the rejected Finance Bill,” said Ruto in a statement.
“The reduction in expenditure, amounting to Sh346 billion, will be borne eaquitable by both levels of government: the national and county governments. With respect to the national government, the reduction will be borne by the Executive, the Legislature, the Judiciary, and our constitutional commissions,” added the head of State.
In his speech, while rejecting the Finance Bill on Wednesday last week, President Ruto had called for expenditure cuts to cover the expected shortfalls in revenues, including allocations to the Executive.
Dr Ruto, whose administration has come under pressure for wasteful spending since the anti-tax protests started, directed for implementation of austerity measures that would involve expenditure cuts affecting all levels of government.
“I direct that operational expenditure in the Presidency be reduced to remove allocations for the confidential vote, reduce travel budget, hospitality and purchase of motor vehicles, renovations, and other expenditures,” he said.
The Finance Bill 2024, which has since been withdrawn following widespread protests that left scores dead, had intended to raise an additional Sh346 billion through various tax measures including the introduction of a 2.5 percent motor vehicle tax, the raising of excise duty on airtime and mobile money transfer fees.
Other tax measures in the condemned Finance Bill include the introduction of value-added tax (VAT) on bread, and increased excise duty on alcoholic beverages, cigarettes, and gambling. There was also a new eco levy that was to be applied on finished imported goods that were deemed harmful to the environment.
In total, the government was expected to collect Sh2.913 trillion in taxes in the current financial year ending July next year to fund the Sh3.997 trillion budget. Non-tax revenues—fees and fees from state bodies—were expected to raise Sh426 billion. The budget hole of Sh597 billion was to be plugged using loans from both domestic and foreign lenders.",2024-07-01
