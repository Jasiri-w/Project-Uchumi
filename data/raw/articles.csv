Milimani Chief Magistrate, Lucas Onyina, directed the case to proceed saying the DPP overlooked the forgery aspect against the former Lugari MP in the government advertising agency (GAA) tender, which involved Sh122 million.
As Savula returns to stand trial, the Director of GAA, Dennis Chebitwei, walks to freedom.
Onyina declined DPP's request to drop forgery charges against Savula, and his two wives over the advertising tender at the Ministry of Health.
Onyina ordered Savula and his two wives, Melody Gatwiri Ringera and Hellen Kepkor Kemboi, to appear before him on September 23 and 24 for further hearing of the case.
Savula and his two wives were charged with alleged intent to defraud on January 10, 2017 They are accused of falsifying documents, namely a Ministry of Health requisition letter, purporting it to have been issued and signed by Judith Sirima of the Ministry of Health.
The magistrate noted the request by the DPP to terminate the case against Savula and his two wives did not consider the forgery charge.
""This court considers the totality of the request by the DPP and the accompanying high court decision and finds that the superior court did not address the forgery charge against the three, which this court directs the DPP to present evidence,"" Onyina ruled.
He however freed Savula, his wives, and 14 others in other 10 counts, including conspiracy to defraud the government of Sh122 million in the Government Advertising Agency tenders.
In his ruling, the magistrate concurred with the DPP that the High Court had established that the substratum of the case was pegged on the contract's legality at the center of the dispute.
He noted that the high court had validated the tender and directed Savula, his wives, and their companies to be paid.
In the case, Savula and his wives are listed as directors of Sunday Publishers Limited, Melsav Company Limited, Johnnewton Communications, Express Media Group, No Burns Protection Agencies Limited, Cross Continents Ventures Limited, and Shiledlock Limited, entities which are said to have irregularly received Sh122.3 million.
Their arrest followed a probe ordered by then DPP Noordin Haji over an editorial published by one of the dailies in which the paper demanded action against GAA for failing to pay Sh2.5 billion owed to various media houses.
They face several criminal charges of conspiring to commit a felony of stealing, abuse of office, aiding the commission of a felony, making a document without authority, obtaining my by pretenses, and attempting to obtain money by pretenses.
The charges against them state that on diverse dates between July 1, 2015, and August 30, 2018, at the Star Department for Broadcasting Telecommunication, Ministry of ICT in Nairobi county, they conspired together to steal Sh 122,335,500 from the said Ministry.",

- Only a few individuals and institutions in Lamu that have had the privilege to install solar panels.
- Lamu West MP Stanley Muthama said once the project will mark an end to the power supply woes.
Since independence, people living in Manda Island which incorporates Ras Kitau, Manda-Maweni, and Manda Airport in Lamu have been relying on traditional means for their energy needs.
It is only a few individuals and institutions, including the Manda Airport, a major amenity in the entire Lamu region, that have had the privilege to install solar panels or rely on diesel power generators.
About five years ago, the national government through the Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Corporation (Rerec), commenced a project to connect the area to the national grid.
However, only 65 per cent of the Sh200 million project, which was to benefit 1,200 households on the remote island, has been completed so far.
Speaking to the Nation.Africa, the residents of Manda termed the move to connect the island with the national power grid as a new dawn to them but called on the government to fast-track implementation.
Mohamed Yusuf Suleiman, the Manda Island Senior Chief, pleaded with the government to fast-track the project, saying it will help revolutionise trade and boost the living standards of the locals among other activities in the area.
Mr Suleiman expressed optimism that once the national power grid electricity is connected to the island, the decades-old challenges and sufferings will be put to an end.
“We’re happy for the ongoing electricity connectivity project on our island. We’ve lived in darkness here for over six decades. You can imagine using traditional wood for our energy needs and using lamps and candlelight for all that long,” said Mr Suleiman.
“I am confident once the electricity connectivity project is over, our small-scale traders in Manda, including ‘mama mboga’ (grocers) will benefit greatly and expand their businesses. Let the project be fast-tracked,"" he added.
Rerec General Manager, Power Distribution and Regional Coordination, James Muriuki, told Nation.Africa that though the project started in 2019 when the tender was floated, the contract was signed in 2021 and its implementation experienced some delays.
According to Dr Muriuki, some of the challenges encountered were due to the requirements for design readjustment.
“The project has seen some delays due to many uncertainties. Only around 65 per cent has been done. There were changes in design for the section crossing the Manda airport and the ocean crossings where four towers, as opposed to two, will be required to support the tension and the suspension forces,” he said.
He explained that the redesigns will require an additional budget, but it is projected to be completed by February 2025.
Mr Robinson Mwambingu, a resident of Ras Kitau, hopes that once completed, the project will open up the tiny island to more trade, business, and investment opportunities.
The project is also expected to lower crime and insecurity as local gangs have taken advantage of the darkness to rob and maim both residents and visitors.
“We’ve had cases of thefts and mugging in this place. All because there’s no electricity. Criminals used to take advantage of the darkness to carry on with their evils. Once lit, Manda Island will be a peace haven,” said Mr Mwambingu.
Lamu West MP Stanley Muthama said once the project is done, it will mark an end to the power supply woes faced by residents on the island ever since it was discovered many years ago.
“Connecting Manda Island to the national grid for the first time since it was discovered will be history that we’ve all been looking forward to. The project is currently at an advanced stage. It’s crucial to the economy of Manda Island and the entire Lamu West Constituency,” said Mr Muthama.",

- According to Makueni Finance Executive, Damaris Kavoi, some of the new taxes proposed by the county government included Sh30,000 for evacuating flammable substances using standby fire engines, Sh3,000 per day for taking wedding photographs at Makongo Viewpoint, Sh1,000 per trip for dung weighing up to 5 tonnes, and Sh100 per trip for donkeys used for commercial purposes.
- Youthful protesters set up tents in Wote Town on Tuesday and Thursday last week and heckled Mr. Kilonzo Jnr over the plan to increase taxes.
Makueni Governor Mutula Kilonzo Junior has backtracked on his plan to increase taxes.
He has withdrawn the county's Finance Bill, 2024, to avert the wrath of residents, who had cried foul over the proposed tax hike.
This comes barely a week after President William Ruto declined to assent to the Finance Bill, 2024, following days of protests by the youth.
Mr. Kilonzo Jnr said he made the move after receiving intelligence reports that residents were planning demonstrations to protest his government's planned tax hike.
""We sat as a Cabinet and decided not to implement our new tax proposals this year after traders said they could not afford them, citing tough economic times. We will revisit the proposals in the next financial year when the economy improves,"" Mr. Kilonzo Jnr told reporters on Monday.
The announcement means the county will continue with its 2023/2024 financial plan. The withdrawal followed intense pressure from residents who complained about the tax plan.
Traders have welcomed the withdrawal of the Bill.
""A tax hike would have broken our backs,"" said Alphonse Mutisya, a boda boda operator in Makindu Township.
Mr. Kilonzo Jnr's administration was to rely on the tax proposals to realise its Sh11 billion budget, which the County Assembly passed last week.
According to Makueni Finance Executive, Damaris Kavoi, some of the new taxes proposed by the county government included Sh30,000 for evacuating flammable substances using standby fire engines, Sh3,000 per day for taking wedding photographs at Makongo Viewpoint, Sh1,000 per trip for dung weighing up to 5 tonnes, and Sh100 per trip for donkeys used for commercial purposes.
He had also proposed a Sh400 increase in the cess paid on a tractor load of sand used for domestic purposes. ""Once the economy improves, we will return to our tax proposals,"" said Mr. Kilonzo Jnr.
Youthful protesters set up tents in Wote Town on Tuesday and Thursday last week and heckled Mr. Kilonzo Jnr over the plan to increase taxes.
Other residents took to social media to pile pressure on the county boss over the planned tax hike. ""Once we are done with the protests against President William Ruto's Finance Bill, we will start with Makueni's Finance Bill, which has punitive taxes,"" said Willie Malile, an activist. Mr. Kilonzo Jnr confirmed that the threats had led to Sunday's announcement of the withdrawal of the tax plans.
""They had even planned demonstrations against the county government. There was a lot of propaganda about our tax proposals,"" he said. He announced a plan to encourage traders to pay licenses and other taxes. ""We have allowed traders to pay for licenses in three or four installments. Traders who pay their licenses in a lump sum will get discounts. Small and medium traders will get a 10 percent discount on their lump sum bill, while large traders will get a 5 percent discount on their lump sum bill,"" he said.",

Stephen Mokogi Nyarenchi was arraigned before Milimani senior principal magistrate Ben Mark Ekhubi on Monday.
Nyarenchi was accused of scaling over the wall of the vital government institution and entering its precincts.
While denying the offence Nyarenchi told the magistrate that he was arrested and detained for five days from June 28 to July 1, 2024.
He was charged with unlawfully entering into the Parliament precincts Contrary to Section 31 (1) (a) as read with Section 31(2) and Section 5 of the Parliamentary Powers and Privileges Act No 29 of 2017.
The prosecuting Counsel Ms Virginia Kariuki told magistrate Ekhubi that on June 28 at around 5:10pm, the accused unlawfully entered the August House compound.
“To access the Parliamentary compound the accused gained entry by climbing over the fence along Parliament Road without lawful authority,” Ms Kariuki told the court.
“Is it true that you unlawfully gained entry into the compound of Parliament,” Mr Ekhubi asked the suspect.
“Not true,” Nyarenchi responded. He applied to be released on bond.
“I urge this court to release me on bond,” Nyarenchi applied.
He urged the magistrate to take judicial notice that he was held in police custody for more than 24 hours before being arraigned.
The accused said he was arrested during the Gen Z demos that were held across majority of the counties countrywide.
Ms Kariuki did not oppose the bail plea saying the offence is a misdemeanor.
In a brief ruling, Mr Ekhubi allowed the accused bail plea. He ordered him to pay a cash bail of Sh2,000.
From the charge sheet, all the witnesses listed in the case are police officers who were manning security at the August House when youth engaged police in running battles.",

- Kasaine was reportedly shot dead a few metres from the gate of Narok Police Station.
- Grieving mother recalls her last moments with her son before his untimely death.
At 19, Brian Mike Kasaine, who was set to join university, was the source of hope for his family who had struggled to send him to secondary school.
The death of the teenager, who was shot dead during the anti-Finance Bill protests in Narok town last week, has left his family in pain and agony.
Kasaine's family is struggling to come to terms with the loss of their son following last Tuesday's protests that led to confrontation between the protesters and anti-riot police officers.
The 19-year-old was the unfortunate victim of a police bullet that snuffed life out of him.
According to his family, Kasaine was shot dead a few metres from the gate of Narok Police Station.
Kasaine, who sat for his KCSE examination last year at St Peter's Nyakemincha Secondary School in Nyamira and scored a B+, was set to join Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University.
His mother, Mary Nyanchoka, is in anguish as she recounts how the day started well before her son met his death.
The grieving mother recalled her last moments with her son before he left to join his peers in the protests.
""He woke up in fine fettle and spirit. We shared light moments before he quietly left home for Narok CBD where he joined other protesters. He was not armed when they shot him. His only mistake was to protest peacefully,"" said the distraught mother.
“It is so painful. I'm still in disbelief and I keep hoping he will wake up,"" she said.
Ms Nyanchoka said when her son failed to return home by 7pm that Tuesday, the family went out to look for him.
""We went to the hospital to look for him but did not find him. We went to the police but the officers said nobody had been arrested. The following day l woke up around 6am to look for him,” she recalls.
“As a family, we are demanding justice. We just want to know who shot and killed my son and what he did to deserve such a death.”
Kasaine died at Narok County Referral Hospital while being treated for gunshot wounds to the stomach.
Kasaine's brother Kelvin Mzee said Kasaine had big dreams and was looking forward to building a good future for himself and the family.
""It is sad that his dreams have been shattered. His life was snuffed out by police officers who are supposed to protect us. We want justice for my brother,” he said.
Kasaine's aunt, Joscar Rioki, could not hold back tears as she demanded for justice.
“The police shot him yet he was not armed. We need justice for Kasaine. He was fighting for his rights as enshrined in the Kenyan Constitution,"" she said.
“Kasaine left home early in the morning and joined other protestors on the streets of Narok town. It was all peaceful until police officers started lobbing teargas canisters and shooting at protesters around 4pm. That is when he was shot, according to his peers,” she said.
Activist Ramadhan Shaban called on human rights commissions to investigate the killing of Kasaine and other young people across the country to ensure that those responsible are prosecuted.
Two more people were shot and killed during the protests in Narok.",
https://nation.africa/kenya/news/-malicious-claims-ig-japhet-koome-says-no-kenyan-police-officer-has-been-killed-in-haiti-4675956,"The National Police Service (NPS) has refuted claims that seven Kenyan police officers have been killed days after landing in the troubled Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince.
Inspector General of Police Japhet Koome termed the claims circulating on social media as “unfounded, false, unpatriotic and malicious”.
“We wish to clarify to the public that our officers left Kenya on June 24, 2024 and were not only received warmly by the great people of Haiti on arrival, but are also all safe and ready to discharge their clear and specific mandate,” he said.
The police boss said the Kenyan officers have been working closely with their host, the Haitian National Police.
“They have so far undertaken strategic mapping of the key areas of operational concerns and conducted several joint patrols within Port-au-Prince,” he said.
He appealed to Kenyans to support the police as they lift the national flag high, along with discharging their international policing mandate.
“As a service, we wish to reiterate that our mission in Haiti is a noble task for the good of our brothers and sisters of Haiti,” stated Mr Koome.
The 1,000 Kenyan troops pledged by President William Ruto for the mission include teams from the Rapid Deployment Unit (RDU), Anti Stock Theft Unit (ASTU), General Service Unit (GSU) and Border Patrol Unit.
Deputy Inspector General of Police Noor Gabow, heads of operations Samuel Chebet (GSU) and Senior Assistant Inspector General Geoffrey Otunge are the police chiefs leading the Kenyan troop.
Mr Koome reiterated that NPS remains committed to collaborating with reputable media houses to update the public on the progress of the Haiti mission.
This happened as Haitian gang leader Jimmy ‘Barbecue’ Cherizier called for community dialogue to help end violence in the Caribbean nation as the first tranche touched down at Toussaint Louverture International Airport on June 25, 2024.
The international airport reopened in late May after gang violence forced it to close for nearly three months.
Riddled with decades of instability, Haiti has seen an escalation of violence following the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse three years ago.
The Kenyan police which is leading the force is facing a daunting task to edge out the violent gang that currently controls 80 per cent of Haiti’s capital.
The gang has also killed thousands of people in recent years and left more 580,000 people homeless across the country.
The arrival of the first 400 officers in Haiti last week elicited mixed reactions amongst Haitians as the troop marked the fourth major intervention in the Caribbean country.
While some welcomed Kenyan officers, others viewed the force with caution, given that the previous UN-backed intervention in 2004-2017 peacekeeping mission which was marred by allegations of sexual assault and the introduction of cholera which killed nearly 10,000 people.
But Haiti’s interim Prime Minister Garry Conille expressed confidence that the help of Kenyan-led international force will end lawlessness in the country.
“I want no-one to doubt the purpose of the mission. The state will regain power and reaffirm its authority so all Haitians can live peacefully in this country,"" he said.
US President Joe Biden has also welcomed the deployment, saying the Kenyan-led mission offered the ""best chance"" to achieve democratic governance in Haiti.
UN approved a policing mission made up of 2,500 officers from various countries as Kenya volunteered last July to lead the international force to stem the wave of violence.
Apart from Kenya, at least five other nations – including Jamaica and Benin – have told the United Nations that they are ready to deploy police officers to Haiti as part of the mission.",

- The groups said if the government uses decisive execution and not a state-led national conversation, then the faith of the generation will be restored.
- They added that many of the issues raised by the youths did not require a policy dialogue.
A section of professional bodies and civil society have dismissed President William Ruto’s call for dialogue saying he knows what to do to assuage the ballooning public anger.
This is in response to the formation of a National Multi-Sectoral Forum (NMSF) by the head of state to try and tame the ongoing unrest by the youth.
They include the Law Society of Kenya (LSK), Kenya Medical Association (KMA), Kenya Union of Journalists and a number of civil society groups.
“The youth for Kenya (Gen Z) have clearly spoken on the urgent need for the state to arrest public theft and a bloated cabinet, invest in essential services, act on those who fired upon unarmed protestors and an end to extra-judicial killings among other demands,” the groups said.
They added that many of the issues raised by the youths did not require a policy dialogue but decisive execution action.
The groups said if the government uses decisive execution and not a state-led national conversation, then the faith of the generation will be restored.
“This will bring back confidence in our constitution and governance institution and create a nation united and driven by our constitutional values. We call on the national administration and 47 county administration to listen and act on the considerations and demands being raised by Gen Z,” the statement read.
Speaking at Ufungamano House on Monday, the bodies said that the police had killed a total of 24 protesters and 361 others left nursing serious injuries.
“As of last night, 24 human beings had been killed by police officers, one of the youngest fatalities is 12-year-old Kennedy Onyango,” the groups said in a statement.
According to the groups, police arrested a total of 627 people countrywide and 32 people had been abducted where some were still missing to date.
They said that those who had been abducted were not even booked in any police station and did not have any charges read against them.
“Tens have been held incommunicado and denied access to their families, legal presentation and medical assistance,” the statement read.
The groups said that most medical practitioners had come under fire as they were arrested by the police who they accused of even stealing patient lists from mobile emergency centers which were located in various parts of the country to serve the injured.
They said even lawyers were denied access to their clients, arrested and intimidated by officers to drop some cases.
Equally, journalists who were covering the protests have had their cameras confiscated, some were arrested and beatent.
For the last two weeks, the country has seen a series of anti-government led demonstrations.
The demonstrations kicked off with a section of youth opposing the Finance Bill 2024.
This forced President William Ruto to decline signing the bill into law.
Currently, the youths have maintained that they will go on with the demonstrations until their woes are addressed.",

Civil servants will continue enjoying comprehensive medical insurance services for the next two months despite the transition to the new Social Health Insurance Fund (SHIF).
The 2023/2024 medical cover administered by the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) expired on Sunday (June 30) paving the way for SHIF which takes effect from July 1, 2024 to August 31, 2024.
Principal Secretary in the State Department for Public Service Amos Gathecha said the new procurement process was initiated following the lapse of the 2023/2024 contract under NHIF.
""The NHIF contract was executed for a period of one year from July 1st 2023 to June 30th 2024,"" he said.
Rollout of SHIF
The new development ends uncertainty and gives relief to patients who are currently admitted and undergoing treatment in various health facilities under the NHIF cover.
""The purpose of this circular is therefore to inform you of the continued provision of comprehensive provision of medical insurance services for the next two months,"" said PS Gathecha in a notice issued on Friday 28, June 2024.
The scheme covers national government employees in ministries and state departments, officers seconded in the county governments and staff of the National Youth Service.
The comprehensive scheme covers all services, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy and dialysis.
Health Cabinet Secretary Susan Nakhumicha last week announced that preparation for the rollout of SHIF will commence on July 1st with registration of persons.
Healthcare services
The exercise, she said, will be conducted countrywide through self-registration by use of a USSD *147# or www.sha.go.ke.
The CS noted that Kenyans will be assisted by community health promoters, NHIF staff in their offices and any other registration point that the Social Health Authority (SHA) board will designate.
In response to the withdrawal of Finance Bill 2024 which aimed to fund the Primary Healthcare Fund, the Emergency, Chronic and Critical Illness Fund and allocate funds for indigents and vulnerable persons, she said the ministry is now adjusting its plans to reflect this development.
""I want to give assurance to all Kenyans and in particular, those who have been enjoying healthcare services under NHIF that they will not be denied treament during this rollout phase.

https://nation.africa/kenya/news/education/-students-want-place-on-budget-making-high-table-4675592,"Complexities of Finance Bills have primarily been the concern of the older generation, who study and debate the content. This year, however, has witnessed a significant shift.
University and college students across the country have paid close attention to the Finance Bill, 2024, expressing opinions and even participating in discussions about its impacts on them, their families and Kenya as a whole.
The Finance Bill, 2024 has become a hot topic in universities and colleges. Study groups have been formed to understand and critique the bill and some of its proponents.
The National Assembly pushed through the contentious bill on Tuesday last week, though some clauses deemed controversial and punitive were dropped.
That was despite streets in the City Centre and other parts of the country teeming with thousands of protesters from as early as 7am. Rumours of snipers failed to deter the determined crowds made up mostly of Gen Zs.
Students, activists and ordinary Kenyans breached police barricades, with some swarming Parliament, prompting security agents to open fire.
“We’ve had enough of this system that dates to the colonial era. We are the future, armed with knowledge at our fingertips. We’re weary of corrupt leaders. Our presence on the streets is testament to our frustration with a future that seems increasingly bleak,” said 24-year-old Mitchell Burudi, an International Relations major.
“I was appalled on scrutinising the Finance Bill, 2024. Why would the government tax sanitary towels? If passed, this bill will burden us with additional costs on essential items. Allocating Sh900 million to the Office of the First Lady is absurd. We demand accountability and transparency.”
For Sarah Mwaniki, a Third-Year Economics student at the University of Nairobi, the bill hit everything – from tuition fees to future job prospects.
“Even before the bill is passed, I find it increasingly difficult to balance my academic and financial responsibilities,” she said.
Ms Mwaniki added that the Finance Bill would have a direct impact on the economic environment she will enter upon completing her undergraduate studies, influencing the availability of jobs and salary expectations.
“We need to be informed and involved. It is about time we started paying attention. Had the bill been signed into law, we would see a rise in tuition fees,” she said.
“Many of us are struggling to remain in school. Additional costs mean dropping out or seeking more financial aid, which is not always available.”
James Kioko, a Third-Year law student, expressed concerns regarding a clause in the bill on land ownership. Had the bill become law, he said, all land would belong to the government, and one could only own a plot on leasehold basis.
“Why should the government take land that has been in the hands of a family for generations? It reduces citizens to slaves and goes against Article 40 of the Constitution that stresses the right to property ownership. That is why I protested. I will still fight for what is right,” he said.
According to the bill, any unemployed person aged 25 and above would be subject to taxation. This angered many as the joblessness rate in Kenya is high and keeps increasing every year.
Kelvin Ochieng, another protester, said he has not had a stable job since his graduation last year. He only gets menial jobs for sustenance “yet the President insists on taxing us”.
“Why can’t he create an enabling environment for businesses to employ us. He keeps saying thousands of young people got jobs after he introduced the Housing Levy last year. Where are they? Why is he telling the world that he has created jobs in Saudi Arabia and other countries for degree holders,” the 25-year-old asked.
The bill reduced allocations to agriculture by Sh5 billion. The Finance Bill, 2023 also reduced cut agriculture budget.
To make matters worse, many farmers accused the government of supplying them with counterfeit fertiliser, resulting in crop failure.
“Farming households are struggling to make ends meet. My school fees is paid through farming. My parents bought fake fertiliser last season, leading to poor harvests. With the proposed budget cuts, how will farmers survive?” asked Mercy Naliaka.
“We grow sugarcane. The price of a tonne keeps falling. This situation is upsetting. That is why I joined the demonstrations.”
For Emily Ndung’u, a Second-Year Media Studies student at Kenyatta University, digital services are a critical learning tool.
She says new taxes on these services could limit access to online courses and research materials, putting students in Kenya at a disadvantage.
The Finance Bill, 2024 proposed to increase the VAT registration threshold from Sh5 million to Sh8 million. It also introduced new levies on some financial services and digital content.
The changes could increase operational costs for universities, colleges and schools that rely on these services.
Institutions using digital services and platforms for education and management could see increased costs.
“Higher cost for digital platforms could mean fewer resources for coding projects and access to software,” said Brian Kimani, a Third-Year IT Student.
Though President Ruto withdrew the Finance Bill, 2024 after widespread discontent that led to street protests and promised to enforce austerity and fight wastage and corruption in his administration, many young people are not sure anything will change.
“It has become evident that the public insists on the need for us to make more concessions,” President Ruto said on Wednesday afternoon, flanked by the very MPs who passed the bill.
“I run a government and lead people. Having reflected and listened keenly to the people of Kenya, I concede. The Finance Bill, 2024 is withdrawn.”
Among the thousands of young sceptics is 24-year-old Dalmas Muriithi.
“We demand that he gazettes the withdrawal of the bill now. We are educated and understand what the President is doing. In fact, the most honourable thing he can do is to resign,” Muriithi said.",
https://nation.africa/kenya/news/education/campus-revolt-why-we-fought-finance-bill-2024-4675540,"The Finance Bill, 2024 has elicited anger among Kenyans, with thousands taking to the streets in protest countrywide.
President William on Wednesday bowed to public pressure, saying he would not sign the bill into law. That, however, appears not to have appeased many Kenyans especially Gen Z, with a huge number vowing to continue with the protests.
Almost all university students interviewed by Higher Education were opposed to the bill. Here is what a sample of the learners said.
Timothy Osoro
The Finance Bill 2024 has created a lot of controversy and concern, especially for students like me.
This bill contains many measures that could greatly impact our current and future lives, and it is easy to see why many people are against it.
As someone who supports these protests, I want to explain why this bill is important and why the protests are so important.
First, the VAT increased from 16% to 18% is more than a small change. This means everything we buy, from books to school supplies to food and personal items, will become more expensive.
Many of us already struggle to pay for tuition, housing, and other expenses, so this tax hike could make it harder to pay what we need to pay.
Secondly, the new digital services tax. In a world where our education relies on digital tools and online resources, these taxes could lead to higher prices for services like e-books, educational software, and learning platforms.
For students who rely on these digital resources, especially those from poor families, this could make access to education more difficult and widen the gap between those who can afford these tools and those who can’t.
This move could lead to higher tuition costs and more financial pressure on students and their families.
Universities and Colleges could also cut scholarships and financial aid as financial aid decreases, making it harder for low-income students to attend college.
Additionally, the bill proposes shorter repayment terms and higher interest rates, which would make it harder for graduates to pay off their loans.
Many of us are already worried about student debt, and these changes could mean carrying the burden for longer and making more payments. This financial stress can force graduates to take jobs inconsistent with their career goals just to pay off their loans.
When it comes to the protests in Kenya, I support these protests because they highlight the real struggles citizens face and demand financial justice.
Protests are a way for us to express our concerns and ask the government to prioritize our needs and our future rather than just generating revenue.
This situation is especially disappointing regarding education, which should be seen as an investment in the future of the country. This bill makes education more expensive and less accessible, potentially leaving students in debt and unable to reach their potential.
Higher income taxes, digital services taxes, reduced college scholarships and tougher student loans can make education more expensive and stressful. Regular protests are an important way for us to stand up and say we want policies that support us, not hinder us.
As a student, I believe it is important to fight for a system that values education and invests in our future. Protests give us a voice and an opportunity to promote a more just and diverse society.

The Financial Bill 2024 presents a challenge for Kenya’s university students giving us unclear future paths for our educational journey and future career aspirations.
As university students, we find ourselves at the centre of uncertainties, struggling with the implications this legislation might have on our futures.
The reality of rising tuition fees and living expenses were already a constant struggle and the proposed bill threatens to aggravate this burden, making higher education even more inaccessible.
This is making us contemplate the possibility of taking on additional jobs or loans just to sustain our education and the current state of living for both our parents and ourselves.
But the bill’s far-reaching ends extend beyond just tuition fees. They circulate about potential cutbacks in funding for internship programs in major student courses like medicine, which are critical stepping stones for many students seeking real-world experience in the medicinal field.
Being in the last semester of my journalism bachelor’s degree, we are required to attend a mandatory industrial attachment before we’re certified with our degree, however being assigned to a media house is a rare occurrence currently and we’re advised to get into the corporate communication sectors where the chances of getting retained for an internship and later a job is much higher than in media houses.
The prospect of missing out on these invaluable opportunities create doubt over our career aspirations.
Internships offer not just experience but vital networking opportunities and losing this support could severely impact our transition into the workforce we have desired getting into a journalism degree.
As we near the end of our academic journeys, the looming question of employment weighs heavily on our minds.
Would the proposed financial reforms hinder the growth of industries and businesses, ultimately limiting job opportunities? The uncertainty is felt deep within ourselves and our parents as we battle the ideas of the possibility of entering a job market plagued by the country’s economic instability.
The fear of the stunted job markets in Kenya, with fewer opportunities and increased competition, is a common concern amongst all my peers.
Today the discussions surrounding the bill intensify while witnessing our age mates band together, protesting against the bill that also affects them in similar or other ways.
Some of our peers are already seeking alternative ways to fund their education, from part-time jobs to entrepreneurial ventures that could be heavily affected once the proposed financial bill is eventually passed as a law.
There’s a growing awareness of the need to diversify our skills and be flexible in our career paths since our awarded degrees could only do so much after we graduate and fully become part of the workforces that contribute to the economy in Kenya.
The protests by the youth today was another urge to the government to consider our plight.
The youth of Kenya are its future and our education and well-being should be a top priority where the efforts and sacrifices made by our parents to provide us the basic need for education, bear the fruits they hoped to witness one day by providing us with a better life than theirs.

The 2024 finance bill poses a threat to me as an individual, to young people, and to society at large. At just 23-years-old, I am the eldest in my family, eagerly awaiting graduation from university with no stable source of income. I mostly rely on the financial support from my parents and the income I generate through various hustles to sustain myself both in school and beyond. The government's decision to increase taxes through the 2024 finance bill will only exacerbate the challenges I already face.
Moreover, the uncertainty of securing a job in the media industry post-graduation is a major concern. We have already witnessed layoffs and delayed salaries for media professionals due to tough economic conditions. The government must not turn a blind eye to this issue. Many media students and young people are turning to digital media, particularly content creation, as a means of livelihood. Imposing taxes on this sector will only lead to higher unemployment rates and discourage self-employment, potentially driving youths towards criminal activities.
The lingering effects of the post Covid-19 pandemic continue to impact us. Many businesses are still struggling to recover, leading to job losses and closures. Even before the discussion of the 2024 finance bill, the depreciation of the Kenyan shilling against the dollar had already taken a toll on citizens and businesses. Introducing additional financial burdens through the finance bill is simply inhumane.
During their campaign, the Kenyan government made promises to prioritize the welfare of local citizens, including small-scale traders and hustlers. However, two years later, it is evident that the government has failed to uphold these promises. The increased taxation and cost of living are causing frustration among the populace. It is disheartening to witness Members of Parliament voting in favour of the finance bill on June 13, 2024, and then claiming it is in the best interest of their constituents. To add on, the arrogance displayed by some leaders in pushing through the bill despite peaceful protests across the country is deeply concerning.
The release of the 2024 Finance Bill sparked widespread reactions on social media and among citizens, leading to protests. I participated in a peaceful protest on a Thursday, which unfortunately turned violent in the evening when the government resorted to using live ammunition against protesters. The use of tear gas and water cannons to disperse peaceful demonstrators is unjustifiable. As a member of Generation Z, I strongly oppose the violence and suppression of youths exercising their constitutional right to peaceful protest. The arrest of activists, doctors, and social media influencers by the government is a clear violation of human rights and an attempt to stifle dissenting voices.
And finally, the Finance Bill 2024 has stirred a wave of discussions and concerns among Generation Z and citizens, touching on various issues such as government spending, education, and healthcare.
As we sail through the complications of this legislation, we are shaping our views on governance, advocacy, and the role of the media in amplifying voices. As a matter of fact, our generation is not just a passive audience but active storytellers and change agents, using our platforms to promote dialogue, challenge norms, and envision a more just society.
To put it briefly, as we continue to analyse the implications of the Finance Bill 2024, one thing remains clear: our voices are powerful, and our actions today will shape the future.

Of late the country has been facing nationwide demonstrations led by Gen-Zs and a handful of millennials due to the proposed finance bill meant to finance the 2024/25 budget. For the purposes of making it effective and functional, the government had to immensely increase the taxes on goods and services across the nation. Shockingly, education sector has not been immune against it. According to the stipulated national budget, the government has reduced allocation of funds from Ksh689.61 billion to Ksh666.46 billion. This is so unfortunate because it’s a sector that’s so crucial for the prosperity of nation’s socio-economic developments. In the same vein, the government has lost its way and it’s now allocating more funds to less sensitive and crucial sectors. Article 43 of Kenyan Constitution states that every citizen has the right to access quality education. The government cutting such like a huge amount means that it’s limiting its citizens from adhering to the constitutional requirements.
The proposed increment in Value Added Tax and excise duties under the proposed 2024 finance bill will both affect the schools management and the parents on primary, secondary and tertiary levels of learning. Let it be known that parents are still struggling with the high cost of living brought about by the government and subjecting them to this bill will be even worse.
One of the promises that was made by the president during his campaigns was the allocation of more funds to boost the school feeding program. It’s unfortunate to see him taking a U-turn and instead cutting it. The proposed removal of school feeding program will subject more students to school drop-outs. For years, low school attendance and high drop-outs has been the main cause of increase in crime rates, teenage pregnancies and drugs abuse among other challenges. This programme has always been used as an enticement to have more primary school-going pupils in schools.
For years, the greatest challenges that have been affecting our learning institutions especially primary and secondary schools have been poor infrastructure, inadequate teachers and teaching resources. Not again, low rate of teachers employment and training has been posing as a challenge. This move will tend to worsen the situation. The government ought to have allocated more funds to change the already dilapidated state of our institutions rather than reducing funds that would’ve improved the image of our learning environments.
On tertiary level, university and TVET courses are currently associated with higher fees than expected. Let it be remembered that sometimes back the government-sponsored students would pay an amount of Sh16,000 per year for similar classes. Not again, they’d get a loan of up to Sh60,000 yearly. This has drastically changed whereby a good number of these students have to pay more amount than the offered one. This explains why they’ve been high drop out cases and low selection of courses. This situation will ultimately get out hand when this bill prospectively becomes a law.
Moreover, with this bill we’ll have low funding of research and creative innovations and projects by students in higher learning institutions plus the running school’s activities. The cutting of that immense amount will force a good number of institutions to transfer the burden to the parents by increasing the fees payment.
It’s high time for the government to rethink of its move. It’s evident that all the sectors in the country rely on the education as it’s bedrock for country’s long-term economic growth, developments and people’s empowerment.

https://nation.africa/kenya/news/education/patience-mshenga-first-duruma-female-professor-now-nurses-ambition-to-head-university-4675570,"When the history of the Duruma community is finally written, there will be no greater heroine in the collective tale than Prof Patience Mlongo Mshenga.
And that would be for a good reason. In 2021, Mshenga became the first female professor from the community. She is also the first Duruma woman to earn a doctorate.
Duruma is one of the Miji Kenda – “Nine Tribes – of coastal Kenya.
Prof Mshenga has broken many glass ceilings and cultural barriers.
She was awarded the Nation Media Group – Aga Khan Award – for being the top girl in the 1985 Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) examination in Kwale District, now Kwale County.
The Marketing Society of Kenya honoured her for being the best Master of Business Administration (MBA) Marketing Option student at the University of Nairobi for year 2000.
After becoming a full professor, she was named Faculty of Agriculture Dean at Egerton University.
Since its inception in 1939 as Kenya’s premier Agricultural college, before it was upgraded to a university in 1987, Egerton’s Faculty of Agriculture had never had a woman dean.
Mshenga is a professor of Agribusiness Management, specialising in agribusiness development and youth employment.
University professor
How does it feel to be the first female university professor from a small community?
“It is indeed humbling. I felt a sense of responsibility for the first time. I actually felt good being referred to as a professor and what I could do for the Duruma, Kenya and Africa in general,” she said.
Prof Mshenga grew up in Mwangani village, Kinango sub-county. She attended Mgandini Primary School and was later admitted to Moi High School Kabarak, Nakuru County.
She joined Egerton University where she earned a Bachelor of Agribusiness Management degree.
After her undergraduate studies, she was retained as part of the programme for employee development. She was hired as a teaching assistant in the Department of Agricultural Economics and Agribusiness Management.
She later earned a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree from the University of Nairobi and a PhD in Agribusiness Management at Egerton University.
The doctorate was sponsored by the Regional Universities Forum for Capacity Building in Agriculture.
While growing up in the village, education for girls was not a priority.
“My father, Ronald Mshenga, was derided by villagers for ‘wasting’ money educating six girls instead of marrying them off,” she recalls.
“They used to tell him that a highly-educated girl would have trouble finding a man to marry but my father did not change his stand. He remained committed to the saying attributed to Ghanaian scholar James Emmanuel Kwegyir-Aggrey who said ‘if you educate a man, you educate an individual, but if you educate a woman you educate a family and nation.”
Prof Mshenga is the fourth born in a family of seven – six girls and a boy.
She says millions of girls in Kenya are suffering in silence as they miss out on education.
“Addressing the many challenges women face will take a long time. Fortunately, there have been improvements in awareness in the last five years. There are positive changes, though gender imbalance is still pronounced,” she says.
“We need to encourage more women to have a family life, children and a career. There should be diversity across all areas.”
Prof Mshenga says Agriculture was not her dream and only settled on the course at the time of joining the university.
Dental surgery
“I wanted to study dental surgery but I scored a B+ in Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) examination,” she says.
From 2010, Prof Mshenga has supervised more than 35 master’s degree students, six doctoral fellows and thousands of undergraduates.
The mother of a 16-year-old girl says the biggest challenge has been juggling between being a mother, wife and university lecturer.
“Balancing motherhood and career is tough. The biological and career clocks are always in conflict. I must always juggle work and family. There is the guilt of missing precious moments and the pursuit of work-life balance,” Prof Mshenga says.
Has she reached the pinnacle of her career? Absolutely not. Prof Mshenga says she is still ambitious and hopes to become a university Deputy VC and even chancellor.
What makes Prof Mshenga proud is seeing her students working for international organisations like the UN Food and Agricultural Organisation, the World Bank and the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology.
Some have registered companies, creating jobs for themselves and others.
She says agriculture will be transformed when young farmers access finance and embrace modern technology.
“Agriculture has the most opportunities in all the value chains, including in research. If few students enrol for agriculture courses in universities and colleges, the country will not have enough manpower to replace retiring officers and sustain agri-food system,” she says.
She is happy with the fact that the Gen Z has launched the Kenya Agricultural Student Association.
“This a milestone. It shows commitment by university and college students to making good use of their training and fostering innovation in the field to produce quality and safe food,” she says.",
https://nation.africa/kenya/news/gender/hope-for-african-widows-as-continent-moots-empowerment-fund-4675438,"What you need to know:
- Widows in Africa could soon have a reason to smile after the idea of establishing a continental fund for them was mooted.
- The idea was fronted by Kenya’s Second Lady Dorcas Rigathi during the inaugural Africa Widows Summit in Zanzibar.
- The summit was themed ‘Women in Widowhood: Reforming the African Space’. It was aimed at crafting solutions to challenges.
Diana Lukosi was devastated in 2007 after she lost her husband of seven years through a road accident.
Diana could not figure out how she would cope with life now that her family’s sole breadwinner was no more.
After the funeral of her husband, things took a more dramatic turn than expected, much to her disbelief.
“I lost all his properties, including land and businesses. I also lost compensation from where he worked and the insurance company,” Diana says.
The mother of two says her tender age, coupled with lack of information on succession, led to her losing everything she was supposed to inherit from her husband.
“I did not know anything about succession. I was not aware that after the death of my husband I was supposed to lodge a succession case in court. I was only a 29-year-old housewife who knew nothing much when my husband died. Those who shortchanged me took advantage of my ignorance.”
She adds that lack of money and necessary resources to undertake succession only fuelled her woes and predicament, much to the advantage of her detractors.
Diana’s plight mirrors what millions of widows across Africa face in their day to day life as they press to inherit their late husbands’ property.
However, the widows on the continent could soon have a reason to smile after the idea of establishing a continental fund for widows was mooted.
The idea to have the African Union (AU) establish a widows’ fund was fronted by Kenya’s Second Lady Dorcas Rigathi during the inaugural Africa Widows Summit in Zanzibar.
The summit was themed ‘Women in Widowhood: Reforming the African Space’. It was aimed at crafting solutions to challenges.
Ms Rigathi urged the African Union to set up a fund to support widows on the continent. She told the conference she was brought up by a widow. She inspired more than 800 widows who attended the Summit not to give up or lose hope.
“My mother was widowed for 45 years, and I saw the struggles she underwent bringing up eight children. She was, however, not a victim of her circumstances, but engaged in businesses and we became who we are because she did not see herself as a victim. Widows need empowerment and opportunities, not sympathy.”
She called on African nations to organise widows into cooperatives, Saccos and community-based organisations to help harness their potential and take advantage of the entrepreneurial spirit of the African population.
“In Africa, we have the spirit of enterprise and women are enterprising. Let the Africa Union come with a policy where the widow is at the centre in areas of business and investment.
""Let the African Union also establish a fund where women borrow without all the bottlenecks and hindrances, and be adequately financed to engage in different types of businesses.”
Currently, Ms Rigathi has a widows programme in Nairobi, Kajiado, Migori, Laikipia, Kakamega, Bungoma, Trans Nzoia, Nandi, Bomet, Kilifi and Nakuru.
The projects include economic empowerment through fish farming, tree nursery establishment, goat keeping, beekeeping, bead-work, agribusiness, dress-making, soap and detergent making, and candle manufacturing, and psychosocial spiritual support.
The President of Zanzibar, Dr Hussein Ali Mwinyi, opened the three-day summit that was attended by more than 800 widows from Nigeria, Cameroon, Tanzania, Zanzibar, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Uganda, and Sierra Leone.
He identified with the plight of widows, and urged nations to look more keenly into their suffering and ways of alleviating the difficulties they face.
“Widows should be legally recognized and respected, economically empowered, and availed of the necessary health interventions, and also education. It is our responsibility to ensure widows are not stigmatized, they are not looked down upon, taken advantage of or humiliated,” Mr Mwinyi said.
Former Tanzania First Lady Anne Mkapa identified with the struggles and challenges that widows go through. She lost her husband, President Benjamin Mkapa, in 2020.
“Addressing the issues affecting widows in Africa requires a multifaceted and comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of widowhood, and empowers the widows to access their rights and resources. It may be useful if African countries were to enact and enforce laws that protect the rights of widows,” Ms Mkapa said.
She noted that such initiatives can help prevent exploitation and mistreatment and ensure widows have access to the resources they need to support themselves and their families.
Ms Mkapa added that countries should also raise awareness of the challenges faced by widows and help change cultural attitudes and practices that stigmatise and exclude them.
Other delegates at the conference included former Zanzibar First Lady Mariam Mwinyi, Zimbabwe First Lady Auxillia Mnangagwa, former Zanzibar First Lady Mama Shadia Karume, and Union of African Widows president Hope Nwakwesi.
One in 10 African women above the age of 14 is widowed, according to a 2018 World Bank report.
Most of them struggle with serious economic constraints, especially if their husbands were the sole breadwinners for their families.
Rural widows in Kenya are particularly disadvantaged by patriarchy, harmful cultural practices and poverty. There are about 258 million widows around the world, and nearly one in 10 live in extreme poverty.",
https://nation.africa/kenya/news/politics/gachagua-all-is-not-well-between-me-and-my-boss-william-ruto-4675144,"Mr Gachagua, however, says the issues between him and the president will be addressed in the spirit of development, unity and democracy.
The fall-out in Kenya Kwanza administration, he said on Sunday, was being fuelled by people who recently joined the government and were now dictating on how those who have stood with Dr Ruto in good and bad times should relate with him.
An indicator that the two top political guns in the country have a frosty relationship, Mr Gachagua said he would engage the youth (Generation Z) on the issues they had raised on governance, in a process outside the one set up by Dr Ruto.
“I have no doubt in my mind the president and I are good friends and we cannot allow anyone to come in between us. We will sort any emerging issues between us. We are calling on leaders to tone down,” Mr Gachagua said.
The DP also alluded to the fact that some people in the Kenya Kwanza coalition did not respect him and the office he holds.
Speak the truth
“Even if you do not like the person in the Office of the Deputy President, respect the office because one day if God blesses you to be there, you will want to be respected,” Mr Gachagua said at Deliverance Church International at Kaplong in Bomet County during a fund-raiser.
The DP said he would continue assisting the president by telling him the truth on issues affecting Kenyans.
“A few people in the government are uncomfortable with the truth and some people around the President do not want me to speak the truth. But, we cannot pretend all is well and look for scapegoats. Let us address the issue the people have raised,” Mr Gachagua said.
The recent outbursts by the DP against National Intelligence Services (NIS) Director General Noordin Haji on lack of proper intelligence briefs to the President on the backdrop of rejection of Finance Bill, 2024, has been interpreted as an indirect attack on Dr Ruto.
The statement was seen to draw attention to the fact that the President might have been briefed on the actual situation on the ground and how the Bill was unpopular among Kenyans of all walks of life, but he ignored it and went on to marshal MPs to vote in support of it.
Mr Gachagua appeared in the tail end of the push for its passage, to waver and did not come out to drum up support for it especially after the backlash over his “one man, one shilling” policy, with MPs and senior government officers appearing to go for his political jugular.
Mr Gachagua has been seen to gravitate towards the political corner of former President Uhuru Kenyatta in Mt Kenya politics and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga in the past few weeks in what has kept tongues wagging about the fate of his position in 2027 General Election and in the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) Party.
Mr Gachagua has lately been denied military helicopters and those operated by government agencies, forcing him to lease private ones in what has been viewed as accelerated fall out with the President.
He has twice missed out in receiving the President at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport on arrival from foreign trips and missed key government meetings chaired by the President.
Mr Gachagua has openly hit out at Cabinet Secretaries, senior civil servants and politicians of undermining him.
He spoke at a function where all the elected MPs in Bomet County who should have played host, kept off. Only Governor Hillary Barchok, his deputy Shadrack Rotich, Emurua Dikirr MP Johana Ngeno, Kajiado Senator Seki Lenku and Kangema MP Peter Irungu were in attendance.
He claimed on Sunday that the political undercurrents in Kenya Kwanza were being fueled by people who opposed Dr Ruto in the last general election, mobilized resources against his candidature, but had joined the government and taken the role of criticizing those who stood by the President through a turbulent time.
“They are the ones criticizing us and telling us how we should relate with the President. It is important for us to take care of the people we have in our corner as we reach out to those who did not believe in us in the first place,” Mr Gachagua claimed.
Professor Barchok threw the DP's and congregation’s attention for the failure by all area MPs to attend the church function and wondered whether they had been instructed to keep off.
“As you can see, all the local MPs have kept off this function. We do not know whether or not they have been directed to keep off. But I want it known that it is only the woman representative Linet Chepkorir Toto who sent an apology and her contribution” Professor Barchok said.
Bomet Senator Hillary Sigei, nominated Senator Joyce Korir, Sotik MP Francis Sigei, Mr Richard Kilel (Bomet Central), Mr Richard Yegon (Bomet East), Mr Victor Koech (Chepalungu), Mr Brighton Yegon (Konoin) did not attend the church service cum fundraiser.
The DP said MPs and senior government officials should listen to the issues raised by the people on the socio-economic and political development in the country.
He stated that the people are at the centre of governance issues which leaders were seeking to address with the current political upheavals in the country.
“Let's not vomit on the people who elected us. Do not display opulence and arrogance on those who elected us in the last general election for the simple reason that you have money and power"" Mr Gachagua said.
""Our leaders should know that you can put out a strong message respectfully. Let us address the voters with humility and dignity as they are an understanding people,” Mr Gachagua said.
Mr Gachagua said the MPs who voted YES for the Finance Bill, 2024 which Dr Ruto has rejected and returned to parliament, should visit their constituencies and apologize to the people who have displayed a lot of anger against them for their action.
“The President has listened to the young people, Kenyans at large and has opened the door for consultation. He has already met church leaders in the ongoing process that is meant to heal the rift and unite the people” Mr Gachagua said.
The DP said it was incumbent upon those in government to listen to the divergent views that Kenyans hold on policies and programs being rolled out, which directly affect them.
“I will engage the youths (Gen Z) to hear their problems outside the framework which the President has created. We want to know what the youths know that we do not (know), what is it that they are seeing that we do not see. In the process, will help the President to address the issues affecting Kenyans” Mr Gachagua said.
“Let us not ignore the youthful generation on the issues affecting the people as the future belongs to them,” Mr Gchagua said.
The DP said there was a lot of backlash against the MPs across the country for backing the Finance Bill, 2024.
“I will no longer carry the burden of MPs as the people do not want to hear anything to do with them wherever I have toured in the last one week. They should face the electorate directly and address the issues being raised” Mr Gachagua said.
Professor Barchok said the disrespect to the Presidency, especially the office of the Deputy President, had fueled the revolt against the government by the people.
""Politicians should carry themselves with humility and stop being arrogant. Let us play our rightful role without overstepping our mandate. How will we unite the country if we are united ourselves,” Professor Barchok wondered.
""The people are disappointed with me and all of us, especially politicians surrounding the President, Deputy President, Governors, Members of Parliament and Members of County Assembly” Professor Barchok said.
Political currents
Professor Barchok said, ""The Finance Bill, 2024 has only triggered the underlying political currents in the country with a display of arrogance, display of opulence in the midst of poverty that risks dividing the country. It is clear we have to weigh our words before speaking or give quiet altogether""
Mr Ngeno called on members of the public to allow MPs to return home and undertake their development agenda to the benefit of the people.
“I am pleading with you voters to tone down, allow MPs to return home, apologize if they must over their position on the Finance Bill, 2024 and embark on development” Mr Ngeno said.
Senator Seki said, ""We are looking up to President William Ruto and Mr Gachagua to provide us leadership and tell us the direction we will take. We need to go back to the people to apologise.",

- The Deputy President made the revelation during a church service in Bomet County.
- Mr Gachagua said he believed that Dr Ruto was the right candidate for the presidency.
Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua, the self-proclaimed honest man, has revealed that his sons did not support President William Ruto’s bid for the highest office in the land.
So serious was this matter that Mr Gachagua says when he told his children that they needed to vote as a family, the votes were split two against two, being a family of four.
He made the revelation during a church service at Kaplong Deliverance Church in Sotik, Bomet County, on Sunday where he added that being the head of the family, he made the final decision that saw his children eventually supporting Dr Ruto.
Whereas his sons, Keith and Kevin, were cautious about going against the former government, Mr Gachagua said he believed that Dr Ruto was the right candidate for the presidency.
“At times, we would cross each other and we would ask their mother to solve the matter. Let me tell you, the days we were supporting President William Ruto, we faced a lot of problems because we were going against the government’s directions and we really had it tough,” he said.
He went on to narrate how the previous regime urged him to withdraw his support for Dr Ruto, who was then, the country’s deputy president.
He said President Uhuru Kenyatta’s regime went to the extent of threatening to jail him, with many court cases being filed against him.
“Nonetheless, I decided to stay with President Ruto because I believed in the destination he had for us. My wife, Pastor Dorcas, supported me. We were now two people against two, and as the chairman of the meeting, I cast the final vote and we all agreed to support Ruto,” he said.
His revelations come amid a growing rift between the two leaders, with Mr Gachagua giving the strongest indication yet that all is not well between him and his boss during the church service.
Mr Gachagua however said the issues that are standing in the way in the relationship between him and the President will be addressed in the spirit of development, unity and democracy.
The fall-out in Kenya Kwanza administration, he said, was being fuelled by people who recently joined the government and were now dictating on how those who have stood with Dr Ruto in good and bad times, should relate with him.",
https://nation.africa/kenya/news/senator-okiya-omtatah-sues-national-assembly-over-budget-making-process-4675740,"What you need to know:
- Omtatah argues that the exclusion of the Senate undermines the constitutional principles of devolution and bicameralism, which are designed to ensure inclusive and comprehensive legislative processes.
- Justice Lawrence Mugambi certified the case as urgent and directed him to serve the respondents with the court documents within three days. The judge directed the case to be mentioned on July 11 for directions.
Busia Senator Okiya Omtatah has moved to court over the exclusion of the Senate from the budget-making process and the allocation of funds through the Appropriation Act arguing that disregarding its input makes the process a nullity.
In his petition to the High Court, Mr Omtatah further said section 39(1) of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA) is unconstitutional to the extent that it sets June 30, as the deadline in each year for the annual Appropriation Bill and any other relevant bills, required to implement the budget to be assented to.
He argued that the Senate's role in the legislative process has been overlooked by the National Assembly over the years, yet the Senate's involvement ensures that all regions and interests are represented and that the implications of financial legislation are thoroughly scrutinized.
He said the Senate must be involved in the allocation of funds to the constitutional commissions, independent offices, and the Parliamentary Joint Services, in line with Article 96(1) & (2), 109 and 110 of the Constitution.
“While the budget estimates and the Appropriation Bill are introduced in the National Assembly, they must, after being passed by the House, be also be considered, debated and passed by the Senate before the Bill is assented into law by the President,” he said in the petition.
Justice Lawrence Mugambi certified the case as urgent and directed him to serve the respondents with the court documents within three days. The judge directed the case to be mentioned on July 11 for directions.
Mr Omtatah argued that the exclusion of the Senate undermines the constitutional principles of devolution and bicameralism, which are designed to ensure inclusive and comprehensive legislative processes.
He said by bypassing the Senate, the National Assembly disregards the critical role the Senate plays in representing the interests of counties and their governments, and providing an additional layer of scrutiny to national financial legislation.
“The petitioners are aggrieved that since the advent of devolution in the year 2013, the National Assembly has annually passed unconstitutional national budgets because it has consistently excluded the Senate from the consideration, debate and approval of the annual budget estimates and the enactment of the annual Appropriation Act,” he said.
The Busia senator wants to ensure that going forward from the budget estimates for the financial year 2024/2025 and the Appropriation Bill, 2024, the estimates and the Bill should be considered, debated and approved strictly in accordance with the constitution.
He said the budget estimates were presented to the National Assembly on April 30, 2024, in compliance with Article 221(1) of the Constitution, which included the estimates constitutional commissions and independent offices, among them Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, Kenya National Commission on Human Rights, Commission on Administrative Justice and National Gender and Equality Commission.
“Therefore, it is imperative for the estimates and the Appropriation Bill to be presented to the Senate, allowing for comprehensive review and input from both Houses of Parliament,” he said.
On Monday, Speaker of the National Assembly Moses Wetang’ula explained that President Ruto’s Memorandum constitutes a rejection of the Bill in its entirety.
Mr Wetang’ula explained that the effect is that the entire Bill will be lost upon approval of the President’s reservations and recommendations by the National Assembly.
“Any Member intending to negate the President’s reservations/veto or revive any of the sixty-nine (69) Clauses of the Bill is required to marshal the votes of at least two-thirds of the Members of the National Assembly, being 233 Members,” he said.
He said the President’s Memorandum recommending the deletion of all clauses of the Bill was informed by the need to reflect the voice of Kenyans who rejected the Bill.
“The Committee and the House shall take this justification into account in their deliberations,” Mr Wetang’ula said.
He allayed fears of the Bill becoming an Act stating that having been referred back to the National Assembly for reconsideration on account of the President’s reservations, the Finance Bill, 2024 cannot become law through a mere lapse of time.
President Ruto assented to the Appropriation Bill, 2024 and Mr Wetang’ula said the financial gap of approximately Sh300 billion occasioned by the rejection of the Finance Bill, 2024 will be achieved by enacting a supplementary Appropriation Bill.",
https://nation.africa/kenya/news/why-muguka-ban-in-kenya-is-unlikely-to-work--4675386,"What you need to know:
- Khat is also cultivated in other countries, including Madagascar, Uganda, Yemen and Ethiopia.
- Somalia is a key destination for Kenyan khat, with 19 tonnes shipped daily in 2022.
Khat – the stimulant leaves and twigs of the plant Catha edulis – seemed to have secure legal status in Kenya despite being illegal elsewhere.
It had been declared an official cash crop in 2016, and efforts were under way to formalise its mostly informal production and trade.
But debate about its legality was revived after Abdulswamad Nassir, the governor of Mombasa County at the Kenyan coast, used his executive powers to ban muguka, a variety of khat, in May 2024.
This was on the grounds that it was bringing harm, especially to children. The ban also followed a trade dispute over levies charged by the county on muguka imports.
The situation is testing constitutional relations between the central government and the counties, as President William Ruto and other national leaders push back against the ban.
This research suggests that khat prohibition in Kenya would be ineffective and counterproductive. It would be better to regulate khat’s trade to minimise harm, while protecting the livelihoods dependent on it.
Khat consists of the leaves or tender twigs of Catha edulis, chewed for their stimulant properties. Cathinone, the main compound, is similar to amphetamine.
Its release is gradual in the chewing process, producing a milder effect than amphetamine in pill or powder form. The effects involve increased alertness, focus and feelings of wellbeing.
Khat is cultivated in several other countries, including Madagascar, Uganda, Yemen and Ethiopia. How it is cultivated varies. Khat produced in central Kenya’s Meru is grown as trees, while in other places, such as Mbeere in Embu and in parts of Ethiopia, it’s grown as a smaller shrub.
Khat has become an integral part of livelihoods in these Kenyan regions, bringing farmers greater returns than tea and coffee.
Somalia is a key destination for Kenyan khat, with 19 tonnes shipped daily in 2022 and earning billions of shillings. Trade within Kenya has also provided revenue for thousands of retailers, transporters, and county and national governments.
The current Kenyan debate has highlighted the distinction between miraa and muguka. Miraa consists of longer stems, while muguka is sold as handfuls of leaves from the tips of the plant. Both have a long history of cultivation in Meru and Embu counties, respectively. Key to muguka’s popularity is affordability, as handfuls are bought for a few coins, while miraa is pricier. This affordability has established muguka as a work boost and leisure pursuit for many across Kenya.
Views towards khat consumption are polarised. Some praise it as a source of sociability, and a part of culture and heritage. Others see it as an addictive “drug” linked to all sorts of harms. Research suggests moderate use has few medical harms, although there are problems associated with overindulgence. Khat is also associated with social harms, such as unemployment, although causality is unclear. For example, people might chew to pass the time when there are few opportunities for work, rather than not having work because they chew.
To ban or not to ban?
The argument is sometimes made that illegality elsewhere proves khat is harmful. However, little research underpinned bans in the US and Canada in the 1990s.
In the UK, research was conducted in-depth a decade ago. Official advice based on the findings argued that a ban would be disproportionate. The UK government went against this advice when it banned khat.
Given the current debate in Kenya over whether to ban khat or not, it’s worth considering what the consequences of a ban would be. Those promoting prohibition hope that a ban would get rid of khat. However, a comparison with cannabis suggests otherwise.
Cannabis is subject to harsh penalties in Kenya, including imprisonment and fines under the 1994 Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, even for possession of small quantities. Still, cannabis remains widely smoked within Kenya.
Many see smoking it as a socially and medicinally valuable practice, even though it’s illegal and some people disapprove. Trade is vigorous as illegality increases its value and traders often have working relations with police who turn a blind eye to business in return for payments.
A khat ban would likely be similarly ineffective in curbing consumption, as was an attempted khat ban by the British in colonial times.
A ban would likely increase corruption and spur a thriving illegal trade. Chewers would still chew, as they continue to in the UK and Netherlands.
Measures to control khat would additionally drain state resources. And revenue from legal trade would be lost. Too many people see khat as a legitimate crop, commodity and item of consumption in Kenya for bans to succeed in eradicating it.
Beyond the current debate
No solution will be perfect and please all sides. But finding ways through regulation to encourage responsible khat trade and consumption, while protecting livelihoods, is surely the way forward.
Some revenue from khat’s trade could be earmarked for measures to boost employment opportunities and improve tough socio-economic conditions that often underlie problematic substance use.
This will require collaborative work between different parties and learning from experiences with other substances.
Alcohol is a useful comparison here. It is a substance associated with far greater harms than khat. Yet, it’s a socially accepted part of leisure for many. It raises revenue and supports thousands of livelihoods.
Getting a balanced form of khat regulation won’t be easy, and alcohol shows you cannot regulate away all problematic consumption. But this is a more pragmatic approach to dealing with khat than the utopian idea that a ban would simply eradicate the stimulant from society.

- Trump hailed the ruling in a social media post, writing: ""BIG WIN FOR OUR CONSTITUTION AND DEMOCRACY. PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN!""
- Trump, 78, is the first former U.S. president to be criminally prosecuted as well as the first former president convicted of a crime. Smith's election subversion charges embody one of the four criminal cases Trump has faced.
The U.S. Supreme Court found on Monday that Donald Trump cannot be prosecuted for official actions taken as president, but can for private acts, in a landmark ruling recognizing for the first time any form of presidential immunity from prosecution.
The justices, in a 6-3 ruling written by Chief Justice John Roberts, threw out a lower court's decision rejecting Trump's claim of immunity from criminal charges involving his efforts to undo his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden. The six conservative justices were in the majority. Its three liberals dissented.
""We conclude that under our constitutional structure of separated powers, the nature of presidential power requires that former president have some immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts during his tenure in office,"" Roberts wrote.
""At least with respect to the president's exercise of his core constitutional powers, this immunity must be absolute. As for his remaining official actions, he is also entitled to immunity,"" Roberts added.
Trump hailed the ruling in a social media post, writing: ""BIG WIN FOR OUR CONSTITUTION AND DEMOCRACY. PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN!""
Roberts said Trump's case will be sent back to the lower courts for further review. The Supreme Court's slow handling of the blockbuster case already had helped Trump by making it unlikely that any trial on these charges brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith could be completed before the election.
The court analyzed four categories of conduct contained in Trump's indictment: his discussions with Justice Department officials following the 2020 election, his alleged pressure on then-Vice President Mike Pence to block certification of Biden's election win, his alleged role in assembling fake pro-Trump electors and his conduct related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.
The court found Trump was absolutely immune for conversations with Justice Department officials but returned the case to lower courts to determine whether Trump has immunity for the other three categories. The ruling marked the first time since the nation's 18th century founding that the Supreme Court has declared that former presidents may be shielded from criminal charges in any instance.
Trump is the Republican candidate challenging Biden, a Democrat, in the Nov. 5 U.S. election in a 2020 rematch.
The decision came in Trump's appeal of a lower court ruling rejecting his immunity claim. The court decided the case on the last day of its term.
Trump, 78, is the first former U.S. president to be criminally prosecuted as well as the first former president convicted of a crime. Smith's election subversion charges embody one of the four criminal cases Trump has faced.
'Misguided wisdom'
Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by fellow liberal Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, delivered a sharply worded dissent, saying the ruling ""makes a mockery of the principle, foundational to our Constitution and system of government, that no man is above the law.""
Sotomayor added: ""Relying on little more than its own misguided wisdom about the need for bold and unhesitating action by the president, the court gives former President Trump all the immunity he asked for and more.""
Sotomayor said the ruling ""reshapes the institution of the presidency.""
Trump had argued that he is immune from prosecution because he was serving as president when he took the actions that led to the charges. Smith had opposed presidential immunity from prosecution based on the principle that no one is above the law.
Rick Hasen, a professor of law at the UCLA School of Law and a critic of Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 election defeat, said: ""The Supreme Court has put out a fact-intensive test on the boundaries of the president’s immunity - with a huge thumb on the scale favoring the president’s immunity - in a way that will surely push this case past the election.""
During April 25 arguments in the case, Trump's legal team urged the justices to fully shield former presidents from criminal charges - ""absolute immunity"" - for official acts taken in office. Without immunity, Trump's lawyer said, sitting presidents would face ""blackmail and extortion"" by political rivals due to the threat of future prosecution.
The court's conservative majority includes three justices Trump appointed.
In the special counsel's August 2023 indictment, Trump was charged with conspiring to defraud the United States, corruptly obstructing an official proceeding and conspiring to do so, and conspiring against the right of Americans to vote. He has pleaded not guilty.
Trump's trial had been scheduled to start on March 4 before the delays over the immunity issue. Now, no trial date is set. Trump made his immunity claim to the trial judge in October, meaning the issue has been litigated for about nine months.
In a separate case brought in New York state court, Trump was found guilty by a jury in Manhattan on May 30 on 34 counts of falsifying documents to cover up hush money paid to a porn star to avoid a sex scandal before the 2016 election. Trump also faces criminal charges in two other cases. He has pleaded not guilty in those and called all the cases against him politically motivated.
A spokesperson for Smith declined to comment on Monday's ruling. A lawyer for his office told the Supreme Court during arguments that the ""absolute immunity"" sought by Trump would shield presidents from criminal liability for bribery, treason, sedition, murder and, as in this case, trying to overturn the proper results of an election and stay in power.
During the arguments, justices asked hypothetical questions involving a president selling nuclear secrets, taking a bribe or ordering a coup or political assassination. If such actions were official conduct, Trump's lawyer argued, a former president could be charged only if first impeached by the House of Representatives and convicted in the Senate - something that has never happened in U.S. history.
In a May Reuters/Ipsos poll, just 27% of respondents - 9% of Democrats, 50% of Republicans and 29% of independents - agreed that presidents should be immune from prosecution unless they have first been impeached and convicted by Congress.
A plodding timeline
Smith, seeking to avoid trial delays, had asked the justices in December to perform a fast-track review after Trump's immunity claim was rejected by U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan that month. Trump opposed the bid. Rather than resolve the matter promptly, the justices denied Smith's request and let the case proceed in a lower court, which upheld Chutkan's ruling against Trump on Feb. 6.
The immunity ruling comes 20 weeks after Trump on Feb. 12 sought relief from the Supreme Court. By contrast, it took the court less than nine weeks in another major case to reinstate Trump to the presidential primary ballot in Colorado after he appealed a lower court's ruling that had disqualified him for engaging in an insurrection by inciting and supporting the attack on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters.
The timeline of the court's immunity ruling likely does not leave enough time for Smith to try Trump on federal election subversion charges and for a jury to reach a verdict before voters head to the polls.
Trump took numerous steps to try to reverse his 2020 loss to Biden.
Federal prosecutors have accused Trump of pressuring government officials to overturn the election results and encouraging his supporters to march to the Capitol on Jan. 6 to push Congress not to certify Biden's victory, based on false claims of widespread voting fraud. Trump supporters attacked police and stormed the Capitol, sending lawmakers and others fleeing. Trump and his allies also are accused of devising a plan to use false electors from key states to thwart certification.
Not since its landmark Bush v. Gore decision, which handed the disputed 2000 U.S. election to Republican George W. Bush over Democrat Al Gore, has the Supreme Court played such an integral role in a presidential race.
Trump also faces election subversion charges in state court in Georgia and federal charges in Florida brought by Smith relating to keeping classified documents after leaving office.
If Trump regains the presidency, he could try to force an end to the prosecution or potentially pardon himself for any federal crimes.",
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/kenya-to-open-market-for-duty-free-eu-imports-4675654,"Kenya and the European Union have enforced a trade deal after a decade of negotiations, opening up the domestic market for tax-free goods from the 27-country bloc after 25 years.
EU-Kenya Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA), which preserves unrestricted access of Kenyan goods to the European bloc except for arms, came into force on Monday, Kenya’s Cabinet Secretary for Investment, Trade and Industry Rebecca Miano announced.
“The EU-Kenya EPA is one of the most ambitious agreements negotiated between the European Union and an African country in terms of promoting economic sustainability. It can serve as a template for other African countries, particularly those in Eastern Africa to adapt,” Ms Miano said in a statement.
“The agreement includes trade, economic and development cooperation and a chapter on trade and sustainable development which covers provisions on labour issues, gender equality, forestry and environment and the fight against climate change.”
The pact, the first trade agreement between the EU bloc and a developing country, ensures Kenya’s largely agricultural produce such as vegetables, cut flowers, fruits, tea and coffee continue to enter the bloc duty-and quota-free.
Nairobi, on the other hand, has committed to gradually lower duty on imports from Europe within 25 years after which trade will be liberalised.
This means no duty will apply for goods from Europe such as machinery as well as mineral and chemical products, while investments from the EU will also be incentivised.
The EPA deal, however, has a protectionist clause which bars the EU from applying blanket subsidies to agricultural exports to Kenya in the absence of a deepened policy dialogue with Nairobi. This clause is aimed at safeguarding agriculture and food security in Kenya against unfair competition from the EU.
Trade between the two parties favours the EU, which sold goods worth Sh223.12 billion to Kenya, while importing Sh150.08 billion.
The enforcement of the EU-Kenya EPA comes after approval from the European Parliament on February 29, paving the way for heads of State and government to complete the ratification process.
The document is largely a modification of the text in the stalled EU-East African Community pact, which was first agreed in October 2014 subject to approval by respective parliaments. The major change is the inclusion of clauses around climate change.
The implementation of the EU-EAC treaty, which Kenya endorsed in 2016, had stalled after the other EAC countries rejected it.
Rwanda signed but did not ratify, while Tanzania and Uganda refused to approve the pact for various economic and political interests, including the fear of European goods flooding the market.
Unlike Kenya, which is a lower middle-income country, the other EAC countries are shielded from higher tariffs on exports under the ""everything but arms"" trade arrangement for least-developed countries.
This is provided for under the World Trade Organisation’s (WTO’s) Special and Differential Treatment (S&D) because they are the least-developed countries (LDCs).
The refusal to cooperate by EAC peers prompted Nairobi to enter into a temporary special arrangement with the EU, which has allowed Kenya’s exports to continue accessing the EU markets duty- and quota-free.
The EAC Heads of State Summit in February 2021, however, allowed partner members to sign bilateral trade deals on condition that they leave room for other EAC countries to join in future.
Kenya and the EU have utilised this window to re-engage on the pact, leaving the door open for other EAC member States to join when they choose to.
This culminated in the signing of the new document last December subject to ratification by respective parliaments.",
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/dar-port-starts-facelift-in-hub-status-fight-against-mombasa--4674792,"Tanzania’s seaport operations are set for a major overhaul after private investors took over the running of the maritime assets with plans to shore up the efficiency and competitiveness of the Dar es Salaam port in the fight for regional businesses with the port of Mombasa.
The refurbishment of Dar port has seen the number of containers entering the inland container depot (ICD) increase by more than 16 fold to 100 containers in 12 hours from six within the same amount of time, while the number of containers ferried by a single truck in 24 hours to 36 hours has increased from one to six.
“It is beneficial to the port because I can see a lot of competition by the private sector. It is a sign of improvement for the port,” says Emmanuel Mallya, an expert in port issues in Tanzania.
“We are seeing positive prospects for the growth of the port. We used to bring to our ICD six containers for 12 hours. Now for 12 hours we are bringing more than 100.”
Dar Port and Mombasa Port play pivotal roles in the East African maritime trade, serving as primary gateways for international trade, facilitating the smooth flow of goods and functioning as transhipment hubs within the region.
The two ports' efficiency affects regional integration, economic growth and trade.
Port users are already seeing early dividends in the shift to allow private players to run the port at a time when Tanzania is working to attract more cargo to its shores.
According to Mr Mallya, a truck initially used to take between 24 hours to 36 hours to bring one container to the ICD but things are changing and currently one truck brings up to six containers.
“All our inland container yards are now full of containers. We don’t know where to send additional ones,” he says.
Dar port serves countries such as Malawi, Zambia, Eastern DRC, Burundi, Rwanda, Zimbabwe and Uganda while Mombasa caters to Uganda, South Sudan, Northeastern DRC, Burundi, and Rwanda.
Tanzania has handed over the operations and management of its maritime sea assets to Dubai’s DP World and India’s Adani International Ports Holdings (AIPH) for a period of 30 years.
The country hopes to overhaul the performance of its maritime assets and strategically position Dar port to compete effectively with the port of Mombasa.
Mombasa port bypassed its main regional competitors, Djibouti and Dar es Salaam in the latest World Bank global ports index over ship delays and non-tariff barriers.
The Container Port Performance Index (CPPI) 2023, shows that the port of Dar es Salaam dropped 55 places from 312 to 367, blamed on inefficiencies while increasing business bottlenecks in the Djibouti port, a facility touted as the region’s maritime hub, resulted in a drastic drop from position 26 in 2022 to 379 in 2023.
DP World and the Tanzanian government signed a deal in October 2023 for the Emirati logistics company to manage two-thirds of Dar es Salaam port for the next 30 years. Under the deal, DP World will operate and modernise the multi-purpose Dar Port.
DP World will initially invest more than $250 million to upgrade the port and the investment could increase to $1 billion during the concession period, alongside hinterland logistics projects.
The agreement aims to optimise the port’s operations to improve transport and logistics services throughout Tanzania and its hinterland.
Adani has also been granted a 30-year concession to manage Dar es Salaam port’s Container Terminal 2, which includes four berths and has an annual cargo handling capacity of 1 million Twenty-Foot Equivalent Units.
With this development, foreign investors now control eight out of 12 berths at the facility.
Kenya is also considering privatisation initiatives for multiple berths at the Mombasa and Lamu ports.
Last year, the Kenya Port Authority invited investors to express their interest in leasing port infrastructure through public-private partnerships.",
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/how-kenya-paid-sh197bn-interest-on-debut-eurobond--4675074,"Kenyan taxpayers paid $1.53 billion (Sh197.4 billion) in interest on the 2014 Eurobond whose last instalment was repaid last Friday, underlining the heavy cost of reliance on commercial debt to fund the budget.
The interest paid is the equivalent of 55.6 percent of the $2.75 billion (Sh354 billion in Monday’s rate) that the Treasury borrowed in the debut sovereign bond in June 2014.
This bond was sold in two tranches of five and 10 years, split at $750 million (Sh96.5 billion) and $2 billion (Sh257.4 billion) and paying interest at rates of 5.875 percent and 6.875 percent respectively.
Eurobonds attract a fixed rate of interest during the life of the loan, and the principal is repaid in a bullet payment upon maturity, rather than on a reducing balance basis.
This is unlike the concessional loans whose principal amount is paid down progressively alongside interest, sparing the borrower having to pay high interest throughout the life of a loan.
Eurobond loans also pose a repayment problem upon maturity as the borrower is required to settle the principal in one go, causing foreign currency liquidity pressure on the exchequer.
For the five-year bond—which the government repaid in June 2019—the interest charge totalled $214.2 million (Sh27.6 billion). On the 10-year paper, the total interest amounted to $1.32 billion (Sh169.8 billion), owing to its higher quantum and longer tenor.
The 10-year bond was partially repaid ahead of time in February through a buyback that was financed by a new Eurobond sale. The buyback saw the State retire $1.44 billion worth of notes early, with the balance being repaid last Friday using the proceeds of a $1.2 billion loan contracted from the World Bank.
“Payment was settled on June 21. Bondholders have received their due (and) the matter is behind us,” Public Debt Management Office director-general Haron Sirima said.
At the time of issuance, the debut Eurobond was seen as a relatively cheap option for development financing owing to the prevailing low international interest rates, and therefore an alternative for domestic borrowing in order to reduce competition for credit with the private sector.
The government identified a number of infrastructure projects in agriculture, transport and energy for funding using the proceeds of the bond, although subsequent audits did not show direct allocation to the projects as had been planned.
In the energy sector, the Treasury indicated that the money would go to expanding transmission lines, and exploration and drilling of geothermal wells.
In the transport sector, the Treasury identified the dredging of the Lamu Port, which was in its initial stages of development at the time, and an urban commuter rail linking the Nairobi city centre the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport as priorities for fund allocation.
In agriculture, funding was earmarked for the Galana-Kulalu irrigation project. These projects were supposed to generate income to help service the loan, according to the initial plans by the government.
A special audit done in 2019 by the Office of the Auditor-General, however, found that the funds were likely put into general budgetary use by ministries after being transferred to the exchequer account.
This made it difficult to identify whether the proceeds of the bond were put into the specific projects that had been earmarked for funding.",
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/eyes-on-president-ruto-office-over-sh667m-budget-cut-pledge--4674838,"President William Ruto faces public scrutiny and delicate juggling over his pledge to cut non-essential expenditures in his office, including travel, hospitality, and the purchase of motor vehicles to curb the wastage of funds.
Official estimates showed that the items listed as non-essential for the President’s office total Sh667 million— putting the focus on the size of chops that would be effected to justify his austerity promise while avoiding inconvenience to his day-to-day activities.
Cuts to travel expenditure may see Dr Ruto reduce local and foreign trips, while the planned refurbishment of his office in Nairobi’s Central Business District and the modernisation of the government printing press could also be halted in the rationalisation plan.
The pronouncement by the President proposing cuts to his office budget was forced upon by days of deadly protests in which the public demanded an end to wasteful and frivolous spending by the State amidst lean times caused by high debt levels.
The proposed cuts to spending by the Executive Office of the President are expected to precede further reductions in spending plans with President Ruto directing the National Treasury to pursue additional austerity measures to cut non-essential spending by Parliament, the Judiciary, and county governments.
“I direct immediate further austerity measures extending to the entire Executive arm of government. I direct that operational expenditure in the Presidency be reduced to remove allocations for the confidential vote, reduce travel budget, hospitality and purchase of motor vehicles, renovations, and other expenditures,” President Ruto said.
The listed spending areas had an allocation of Sh667 million for the financial year starting today, according to data from the National Treasury budget books.
Spending on domestic and foreign travel had been estimated at Sh10.4 million and Sh7.5 million respectively, a higher allocation compared to the Sh5.2 million and Sh7.2 million programmed in the budget ended June 30. The hospitality supplies and services budget was however lower at Sh84.7 million in contrast to Sh144.1 million previously.
The purchase of vehicles and other transport equipment for the Executive Office of the President would have however gobbled up Sh50 million from Sh27.3 million previously.
Other recurrent spending areas for the office cover printing, advertising, and information supplies and services; training expenses, purchase of fuel and lubricants, purchase of office furniture and the routine maintenance of vehicles and other transport equipment.
Proposed cuts to development spending by the office cover the refurbishment of buildings at Harambee House which hosts the Executive Office of the President and the modernisation of the press and refurbishment of buildings at the government printer which sits on Haile Selassie Avenue in the capital city.
The budget to refurbish the President's office in Nairobi CBD was set at Sh14.3 million while the upgrade of the government printer would cost Sh500 million.
The total budget to the Executive Office of the President had been set at Sh5.3 billion for the year to June 2025.
President William Ruto can implement the desired changes to the Sh3.92 trillion budget through the 1st supplementary estimates for the 2024/25 financial year having signed the 2024 Appropriations Bill into law on Friday as passed by MPs.
The President indicated that the supplementary budget would achieve cuts of Sh346 billion covering the hole resulting from the withdrawal of the 2024 Finance Bill.
The initial Sh3.92 trillion budget included Sh2.78 trillion in recurrent spending, Sh687.9 billion in development spending, Sh446.1 billion in transfers to counties including equitable share, Sh43.6 billion to Parliament, and Sh23.6 billion to the Judiciary.
The National Treasury expected to fund the budget through Sh3.3 trillion in total revenue collections including Sh2.91 trillion in taxes, leaving behind a balance of Sh597 billion to be plugged by Sh33.8 billion in external financing and Sh263.2 billion in domestic borrowing.
The withdrawal of the 2024 Finance Bill has however thrown a spanner in the works, requiring the exchequer to come up with a fresh fiscal framework including a lower spending target and/or new tax measures and reforms.",
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/opinion-analysis/columnists/leaders-gaslighting-us-to-submission--4674968,"The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines gaslighting as the psychological manipulation of a person usually over an extended period of time that causes the victim to question the validity of their own thoughts, perception of reality, or memories and typically leads to confusion, loss of confidence and self-esteem, uncertainty of one's emotional or mental stability and a dependency on the perpetrator.
The dictionary continues to explain that the term gaslighting originated from the title of a 1938 play and the movies based on that play, the plots of which involve a man attempting to make his wife believe that she is going insane. His mysterious activities in the attic cause the house’s gas lights to dim, but he insists to his wife that the lights are not dimming and that she can’t trust her own perceptions.
I ended my column last Monday by saying that following the Gen Z protests the previous week, corporate leaders need Gen Z mentors to help them get a real-time understanding of their current and future customers. Then things became hotter last Tuesday and Thursday.
Gas flame hot. Conversations on various social media platforms became emotive, passionate and even incendiary. Two debates on two different groups that I am a member of stood out for me. The first, a neighbourhood group, had two Members of Parliament (MPs) who voted yes and were specifically called out for this. One MP hugged a mute tree and remained as silent as a Manchester United fan at a Premier League Recent Winner’s Whatsapp group as the group chatter went on and on about how tone-deaf the political class were choosing to be against their constituents.
The second MP chose to leap off the self-incriminating cliff with defensive clapbacks on why they voted yes, once a video of them speaking in Parliament supporting the controversial Finance Bill was posted on the group. This MP thumped their chest and said they had nothing to apologise for. The abuses that followed sent the second MP to join the first one sitting under the Old Trafford mute tree.
The second debate was on a different group of professional colleagues. Amongst them is a senior public servant who chose to come in and throw a grenade. Rather than reading the room where there was also much discussion about the reason behind the tax protests, the individual chose to paint a picture of chaos, fear and despondency if the protests, which by this time had started having violent outcomes, didn’t end.
The individual did not for a single minute explain the rationale behind the Finance Bill. Not a single minute. Consequently, many of the other group members called the individual out, asking them to remove the rose-tinted glasses and red carpet-lined blinkers that were blocking them from seeing what the mood of the nation was. Following the withdrawal of the Finance Bill later that day, nothing has been heard from the individual who likely joined the other MPs sitting under the Old Trafford mute tree.
Legislators post dancing videos on Tiktok, swaying their hips with shiny faces lifted to the Range Rover heavens, thanking their Lexus gods for the far they have come.
When called out for the exuberance of their instant coffee wealth, they rubbish the naysayers and call them jealous. They gaslight the public and tell them how a stable country is critical for prosperity and that the new taxes will be good for the country. They look for an evil bogeyman who is pulling the strings of resistance, since Kenyans are unable, neither individually nor collectively, to see wanton wastage and blatant corruption.
We get it, dear public servants. We get it completely. You know better than us what is good for us. You know what good governance looks like from the third floor of your newly purchased Karen villas. You rush to give us good governance as your chase cars run us off the road, with the ubiquitous dour-faced bodyguard pointing an ashen walkie-talkie holding wrist at us for daring to share the same tarmac that you do.
You have set world-class governance standards from all the international benchmarking you have done and would have continued to do in the quadrupled parliamentary travel budget that the Finance Bill had set. We remain in stupefied awe of your brilliance as you attempt to gaslight us into a chaos-led submission. What a sad time for Kenya.

https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/markets/capital-markets/demand-for-t-bills-dries-up-against-higher-interest-rates--4674734,"The demand for Treasury bills (T-bills) by investors has dried up even as interest rates on the short-dated securities continue to rise, upsetting the Central Bank of Kenya’s (CBK) plan of lowering interest rates on government paper.
Last week’s T-bill auction, which aimed to raise Sh24 billion, only realised Sh7.6 billion in investor bids against Sh14.4 billion in the previous week.
Bids on the short-tenor papers narrowed throughout June, falling from Sh36.2 billion in the first week, and Sh22.7 billion in the second.
Interest rates on the bills have nevertheless continued to soar week on week with the return on the 91-day T-bill edging higher to hit 15.9771 percent.
Rates on the 182-day and 364-day bills have meanwhile hit 16.7636 and 16.7911 percent, respectively.
The market-weighted average interest rate for the 91-day paper pushed above 16 percent in the auction signaling underlying pressures on interest rates despite CBK expectations on the easing of interest rates on government securities.
CBK has continued to reject expensive bids from investors having accepted Sh6 billion from the recent auction despite its underperformance.
Investor apathy on Treasury Bills is expected to put the apex bank under pressure as it seeks to raise at least Sh15.6 billion from this week’s T-bill auction to cover the redemption of previously issued short-term papers.
The balance of Sh8.3 billion is expected to cover new borrowing from T-bills.
High interest rates on T-bills continue to linger in a high for longer interest rate environment which is underpinned by a tight monetary policy with the Central Bank Rate at 13 percent compared to 10.5 percent at the same time last year.
CBK primarily deploys Treasury bills to control the money supply in the economy and balance out short-term liquidity requirements for the State.",
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/corporate/technology/how-firms-can-ride-on-x-spaces-to-net-masses--4675042,"At the height of the anti-Finance Bill protests, organisers shattered records by setting up interactions that saw listeners hit highs of over 130,000, demonstrating the efficiency of the platform to gather mass audiences of diverse walks of life using minimal resources.
Unveiled in December 2020 to encourage individuals and businesses to build more personal connections with their audiences, the feature which acts like a virtual room allows users to have live audio conversations.
Other rival offerings, which have not gained as much traction, include Meta’s beta app for Oculus Rift which allows Facebook friends to hang out in virtual reality as well as WhatsApp channels and WhatsApp communities which are close-knit group tools used to organise and manage conversations.
According to digital marketing strategist Egline Samoei, X emerged as an effective tool for mobilisation during the protests because of its open structure that allows prioritisation of topics in feeds as opposed to individual relationships between interacting accounts.
“It’s an open and public platform in that you don’t have to be friends with someone to view their postings hence the content reaches as many people as possible,” she opines.
“X Spaces has proven to be a powerful feature on X. Businesses can leverage this feature for brand awareness, driving engagements and community-building conversations around products to provide a deeper level understanding which will in turn foster brand loyalty,” she adds noting that the engagements are also fertile ground from which businesses would pick valuable customer insights.
Her sentiments are echoed by Dennis Maina, managing partner at digital marketing agency Suss Digital Africa, who calls on marketers to stay adaptive and forward-thinking.
“The digital marketing landscape is in a constant state of flux, and success lies in the ability to not just ride the waves but to anticipate and leverage the currents that propel the industry forward,” he states. “Marketers need to ensure each interaction contributes to a unified brand image and a consistent narrative.”
Other gains derived from hosting the conversations include increased visibility on the general platform, helping businesses network with relevant influencers, offering an opening to demonstrate expertise as a specialised authority as well as strengthening relationships with customers.
But how do you amass the numbers?
The pundits explain that the first step is always building a strong community that discusses topics of collective interest, while also taking care to occasionally throw in themes around general trends to sustain interest.
According to Ms Samoei, one of the key primary challenges that businesses seeking to pursue the route will grapple with is maintaining a consistency of high-quality topics that keep audiences engaged throughout.
“Also, since the x Spaces is public, one may face brand hijacking or brand safety issues. It’s worth mentioning that sometimes the X Space may experience glitches making the Spaces inaccessible for some users,” she states.
According to research conducted by X whose findings were published last year, every 10 percent increase in conversations powered by the Spaces resulted in a three percent increase in sales volumes.",
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/corporate/technology/naivety-do-you-have-this-innovators-superpower--4675034,"I fondly remember an opportunity in telecommunications where a local telco was struggling with the implementation of service and risked going over budget and being out of allocated time. Their partner in the project was a large multinational organisation that had deployed similar solutions for a handful of other peers in different markets.
By all measures, ambition, and logic, this should have been a walk in the park, with world-class infrastructure, fantastic pedigree in talent, and subscribed standards. What remained unaccounted for was the deep fragmentation in devices on the network at the time, meaning that suddenly the standard would not deliver. Enter naivety.
When we think about the concept of disruption, we are inclined to imagine that it requires one to be well-versed in an industry, sector, product, service, or process. Shouldn't the best solutions come from those who understand the intricacies of the problem they are solving?
Absolutely! But sometimes, the biggest roadblock to innovation is not a lack of knowledge, but an acceptance of the status quo, better articulated as standards.
In this story, I tasked my team to think through possible solutions to the problem, with a deliberate decision made not to mention the ""problematic” standard. To be clear, the issue was not in the standard itself, as it addressed the section of the market, but that its presence and prior deployment success blinded those on the project to any other options, including going back to the drawing board.
In a few weeks, across multiple sprints, the team delivered a solution that passed the test for problem fit, deployed, and scaled to great success.
As counterintuitive as it may sound, the ability to look at a problem or opportunity through virgin eyes can many times be the differentiator in creating and unlocking value.
Look at the innovations celebrated now. They may seem obvious after the fact but were most likely viewed as ludicrous at the beginning. You must question and interrogate how things have always been done, to either take a tangent and chart a new path or improve on the current one.
However, there is a caveat. Unchecked, naivety can be a recipe for disaster. While a clear-eyed view of the problem cum opportunity is essential, so is a healthy respect for the realities of the industry. Naivety can easily become a liability, potentially leading to wasted time, capital, and ultimately a failed venture.
The sweet spot lies in striking a balance. The ideal team might have a visionary outsider at the top tempered by seasoned industry veterans who can help navigate sector complexities, sidestepping critical mistakes and errors.
Ultimately, the key to unlocking the true power of disruption lies in recognising that the most transformative ideas often come from those who see the world a little differently. Naivety, combined with experience and respect for the playing field, can become the secret sauce that moves a startup from an audacious idea to an industry-changing force.",
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/markets/capital-markets/money-order-use-dips-33-percent-on-customer-shifts--4674742,"Kenyans issued fewer money orders last year due to a bigger shift by customers to other digital payment systems and reduced disposable income.
A money order is a secure alternative to cash or a personal cheque, which you can use to send money or pay bills. It works much like a cheque and is usually issued by a banking institution. You can cash or deposit a money order into a bank account.
Money orders are readily accepted and converted to cash and are often used by people without access to a standard checking account. They are an acceptable form of payment for debts, both personal and business. You can buy a money order for a small service fee from most banking institutions.
Data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) shows the number of money orders issued last year fell by a third (33.3 percent) from 2022 pointing to a higher uptake of electronic funds transfers, mobile payment applications, and use of credit and debit cards.
Some 4.6 million money order papers were issued last year from 6.9 million in 2022.
Although the issued money orders declined, the number remains high and has been climbing from 1.19 million in 2019 to 3.15 million in 2020 and a high of 9.4 million in 2021.
""The number of money orders issued declined by 33.3 percent from 6,999 thousand in 2022 to 4,668 thousand in 2023,"" said the statistics bureau.
Despite the decline in their usage, money orders are preferred for their security compared to checks because they don't include personal banking information, such as the bank's account information.
Money orders are purchased upfront with cash, hence a minimal risk of having it bounce after depositing.
In jurisdictions where electronic payment methods are less prevalent, money orders can be a convenient and reliable way to send money and are widely acceptable.
Money orders are issued by the post office or banks. Some international payment service providers charge from as low as 1 percent of the sum value of a money order while others charge up to 8 percent of the principal amount.
The KNBS data shows that overall postal and courier services output rose by 36.1 percent from Sh19.9 billion in 2022 to Sh27.1 billion in 2023 attributed to outgoing courier packages from 4,733 to 5,215 in the period under review and an increase in registered and insured items posted.",
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/gen-zs-hold-less-than-3pc-of-state-jobs--4674820,"Less than three percent of jobs at ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs) are held by Kenyans aged below 25, a report by the Public Service Commission shows, citing concerns about low pay and lack of flexi-time and underlining difficulties in retaining young talent.
The age group, popularly known as Generation-Z (Gen-Zs) held a paltry 1,730 positions out of the 74,877 civil service jobs across the MDAs, while 41,689 jobs are held by Kenyans aged over 41.
Kenya has for years been struggling to create jobs for university and college graduates with the unemployment crisis fueling public outrage.
The disclosures, contained in a workforce review by the PSC highlight the lack of incentives such as career growth opportunities at the MDAs and remuneration as major causes of low retention of young talent.
“There is a moderate challenge in retention of employees under Generation-Z who usually join the service at the entry level,” PSC says. “This (low retention) could be attributed to the perception of low remuneration and unfavourable conditions of service, especially in view of global embracing of flexible-work arrangements and technology and lack of clarity in career advancement” it adds.
The age group between 20-24 years is the worst hit by Kenya’s ticking unemployment time bomb, with a growing number of them increasingly looking abroad, mainly in the Middle East, for employment.
Young Kenyans are keen to work for flexible hours with a majority finding it tough to work in the 8am to 5pm office environment.
Majority of the university and college graduates are opting for casual jobs and online tasks in the face of the thinning job opportunities at the government offices and private sector.
Treasury’s decision to freeze fresh recruitment at the government offices has further cut the chances of young Kenyans securing jobs in the MDAs and other public offices.
The private sector has also gone slow on hirings amid tough economic times marked by increased operational costs, stiff competition, and near-stagnant sales.
Frustration in securing jobs and a rising cost of living has fueled public anger with Gen-Zs currently at the forefront of anti-government protests that have rocked the country since this month, driven by the Finance Bill, 2024 which has since been withdrawn.
The PSC data shows that Kenyans aged between 36 to 40 years account for the highest chunk of the jobs at 16.21 percent or 12,136 slots followed by those in the bracket of 41 – 45 years at 15.49 (11,595).
More than one-quarter of the jobs or 19,257 positions are held by Kenyans aged over 51 years, presenting a mass exodus in the next 10 years which will add to the government’s pension burden besides raising questions on skill transfer.",
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/corporate/companies/nhc-stuck-with-sh1-3bn-unsold-houses--4674950,"The National Housing Corporation (NHC) is stuck with hundreds of houses valued close to Sh1.3 billion it has been unable to sell, even as the government pumps more through its affordable housing programme.
Latest details reveal that by June last year, the corporation had a stock of unsold houses across different parts of the country, some of which were completed years ago but have not attracted buyers.
“The statement of financial position reflects an inventories balance of Sh1,305,018,402 which includes an amount of Sh1,275,730,014 relating to stock of unsold houses held by the Corporation. As previously reported, despite some of the projects having been completed several years ago, the houses have remained unsold and hence they continue to be reported as inventories,” Auditor-General Nancy Gathungu notes in a report.
NHC housing units sell at between Sh1.58million and Sh8.75million, depending on the size and location. For instance, a studio apartment under the affordable housing scheme retails at Sh1.58 million while the most expensive three-bedroom master ensuite unit goes for Sh8.75 million. Although the auditor-general does not specify the number of unsold units, projections show that they are in their hundreds going by the Sh1.3 billion total value.
This raises questions on how the State will market the thousands of houses it has lined up with billions of shillings already being pumped into the programme.
President William Ruto continues to insist on the importance of the affordable housing project in the creation of jobs for youth but the government has been silent on how it will ensure the units are sold after completion, with the majority of targeted beneficiaries being low-income earners.
Formally employed Kenyans have since July last year been deducted 1.5 percent of their salaries towards the Housing Levy Tax, with the amounts being channelled to the Housing Fund.
But the auditor-general now reveals that with the “stock of unsold houses"" constructed over the years continuing to pile, NHC is now having to approach individuals and institutions to buy them, to no success.
“Management explained that it has scaled up engagement with County Governments, Saccos, Kenyans in the diaspora, and other relevant institutions to market the unsold houses,” Ms Gathungu says in her report on NHC.
Unable to offload the houses to the market, NHC has been forced to rent out houses worth Sh843 million, but Sh433 million houses remain idle.
On its website, the NHC lists at least 10 projects where it has residential houses it is selling. They include Kisumu Kanyakwar, Phase Three where it has 100 houses, and Stoni in Athi River where it has 160 unsold affordable houses and 110 unsold affordable houses in Homa Bay.
“In the circumstances, the Corporation may not have obtained value for money for the schemes implemented at Sh1,275,730,014 included under inventories,” the audit notes.
In its expression of commitment to Housing, the government budgeted Sh92.1 billion to the sector for the fiscal year starting July, including Sh67.4 billion that will go to affordable and social housing.
This is more than thrice the Sh28 billion budget the government allocated to Housing in the 2023/24 fiscal year, though only Sh5.45 billion had been spent by the end of May.
“The Government’s commitment is to turn the housing challenge into an economic opportunity to create quality jobs for the youth directly in the construction sector and indirectly through the production of building products,” Treasury Cabinet Secretary Njuguna Ndung’u said while delivering the 2024/25 budget.
The government’s plan- which has not been achieved so far- is to construct 200,000 houses every year.
MPs recently blocked a plan by the Treasury to open up affordable houses for open sale in the market, amid objection by Kenyans who sensed a plot to let non-deserving rich people end up being beneficiaries of the houses meant for low-earners.
Treasury had in the Finance Bill, 2024, proposed to amend the Affordable Housing Act to remove a requirement that owners of affordable houses seek approval from the affordable housing board prior to sale of their houses.
This risked leaving the houses free-for-all and selling at market prices, despite having been built on the back of taxpayers’ money so that they can specifically benefit low-earners.
“The Committee noted that the current provision in the Affordable Housing Act limits the right to property as enshrined in the Constitution and would be subject to abuse and therefore recommended deletion of the clause,” the National Assembly’s Finance and Planning Committee stated.
Section 54 of the Affordable Housing Act, 2024- which Treasury wanted to delete- states “Except with the prior written consent of the Board, a purchaser of an affordable housing unit under this Act shall not by contract, agreement or otherwise, sell or agree to sell his or her unit or any interest therein to any other person.”
Following the proposal by the Treasury, Kenyans petitioned parliament objecting to the move, arguing that it risked creating a loophole that would be exploited by rich, non-deserving persons to own the houses.
“Repealing the section that prohibits buyers from selling affordable houses will lead to speculative purchases by the wealthy and well-connected, thereby excluding the citizens who are intended to be the primary and sole beneficiaries of the programme,” a petitioner Kevin Wanambisi said.
Another petitioner Elizabeth Nyangara asked the committee to block the proposal by the Treasury “because selling the units incentivizes corrupt individuals to take up units built with taxpayer money, sell the same, pocket the difference, and jump the queue again to do it all over again.”",
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/eac-achieves-100pc-mobile-penetration-beats-africa--4674810,"East African countries have achieved 100 percent mobile penetration at 199.7 million subscribers, ahead of Africa’s 92 percent but short of the globe’s 111 percent as of the close of last year.
Fresh data from the East African Communications Organisation (EACO) indicates that the regional penetration growth for the year ended last December outpaced both the average of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Africa region as well as the global average which moved 10 and four percentage points respectively.
In its regional sector report for 2023 published last week, EACO further indicated that the region’s mobile internet subscriptions stood at 61 percent penetration with the annual internet traffic hitting 2.9 billion gigabytes.
The regional average for third-generation (3G) coverage rose from 71 percent to 78 percent with Kenya and Rwanda leading with almost universal coverage at 97 percent and 99 percent respectively. Fourth generation (4G) on the other hand, expanded its regional coverage from 52 percent to 62 percent where Kenya and Rwanda again led the way with close to or exceeding 97 percent.
At the same time, mobile data prices in the region were found to have fallen significantly over the three years to last year, further accelerating the adoption of mobile services.
“The influx of low-cost smartphones from Chinese manufacturers has made mobile phones more accessible to a wider population. Increased competition among mobile network operators and government interventions have also driven down data costs, making internet access more affordable.”
According to EACO, innovations such as Kenya’s M-Pesa have partly contributed to the penetration growth due to their heavy reliance on mobile telephony services.
The report indicates that mobile money subscribers in the region stood at 128.7 million, reflecting a 64 percent penetration rate.
In Kenya, the latest Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) data shows that the total number of mobile phone devices connected to mobile networks stood at 65.7 million as of the end of March, translating to a 127.5 percent penetration rate.
During the three months to last March, Kenyan dumped the active use of 628,818 feature phones in favour of smartphones whose uptake grew by 886,884 gadgets within the same period.",
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/opinion-analysis/columnists/historic-gen-z-protests-ushering-new-era-of-activism-in-kenya--4674988,"Kenya has recently emerged as a beacon of civic and political activism, driven by a historic wave of protests addressing various social and economic grievances.
The powerful EndFemicideKe protests called for gender justice, while demonstrations against forced evictions and demolitions in informal settlements during the flood season highlighted the plight of marginalised communities. Yet, it is the widespread outrage over the contentious Finance Bill 2024 that truly galvanised the nation, drawing intense scrutiny and support both domestically and globally.
These protests have made history with their groundbreaking use of technology to rally and unite citizens beyond traditional tribal divisions.
The innovativeness, boldness, and resilience of Kenyan Gen Zs and millennials in activism tactics are noteworthy. Technology and social media played crucial roles in enabling broader participation in political discourse, increasing scrutiny of government actions, and empowering a demographic that challenged traditional power structures.
Scores of citizens voiced their frustration, anger, disappointment, opposition, and demands online and organised nationwide protests using hashtags like #EndFemicideKe, #TotalShutdownKenya, #RejectFinanceBill2024, and #OccupyParliament on social media platforms such as TikTok and X. Online petition platforms like Change.org (against the Finance Bill) and Avaaz.org (against femicide) were also used to rally public support.
The year began with massive demonstrations against femicide, driven by alarming statistics and a demand for stronger legal protections and enforcement. January and February saw some of the largest protests in Kenya’s history, with women and allies marching to demand justice for victims and stricter laws to protect women.
Led predominantly by young women and feminists, including many Nguvu Change Leaders playing different roles, these protests highlighted systemic gender-based violence and the need for legislative reforms to ensure the safety of women and equality.
In April, protests erupted over unfair demolitions and evictions following severe flooding, which disproportionately affected vulnerable communities. The evictions were deemed inhumane as many felt brutalised and were left without an alternative place to relocate to, no fair compensation, sufficient notice, or proper consultation.
These protests mark a turning point for Kenya, heralding a new era of collective action and political and social accountability in Kenya that has reshaped public discourse and policy direction.
They reflect deep-seated discontent and growing disillusionment among young Kenyans with existing policies that overlook public participation and fail to address urgent national issues. There is a demand for youth and women to have a meaningful role in shaping the future, not just demanding change but actively steering its course.
The government’s response was criticised as selective and punitive, prompting calls for fairer environmental policies and better disaster management.
The most recent wave of protests has been driven by opposition to the Finance Bill 2024, which proposed significant tax hikes. These demonstrations, marked by a diverse demographic including millennials and mostly Gen Z participants, showcased widespread economic discontent.
The proposed tax increases were seen as burdensome, especially for the younger population struggling with unemployment and economic instability.
The outcome, which saw President Ruto conceding, underscores the growing influence of young people and women in national affairs, though their voices and concerns are often excluded from top decision-making. This has widened the gap between the government and disillusioned citizens who have lost faith and trust in leadership.
In supporting and amplifying these transformative movements, the younger generation and women, civil society organizations (CSOs), the media, and the government have pivotal roles to play. CSOs can provide the necessary organizational infrastructure, resources, and advocacy training to sustain the momentum of these protests, ensuring that young voices are heard and their demands are met.
The media, as a powerful tool for shaping public opinion, can continue to spotlight these movements, foster informed debate, and hold those in power accountable. Meanwhile, the government must embrace a collaborative approach, engaging in constructive dialogue with these young activists and stakeholders to co-create policies and solutions that reflect the diverse interests of all Kenyans.
Together, these efforts can pave the way for long-term solutions, fostering a more equitable and just society where every Kenyan, especially the youth and women, can thrive and participate meaningfully in shaping the nation's future.
