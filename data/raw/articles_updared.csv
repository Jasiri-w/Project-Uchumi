https://nation.africa/kenya/life-and-style/entrepreneur-finds-success-turning-textile-waste-into-carpets-and-padding-for-sofas-toys--4686274,"In March this year, the East African reported that Mitumba imports from China to Kenya jumped by 86.2 per cent in the first quarter of 2024. Over the years, the volumes of second-hand clothing, shoes and textiles have increased at worrying rates.
But quantity is not the only issue - several organisations have raised alarm over the quality of second-hand textiles making their way into Kenya and Africa from around the world. A 2023 report by Changing Markets Foundation, an organisation that exposes irresponsible trade practices - titled Trashion: The stealth export of waste plastic clothes to Kenya, shows there is an increasing number of low quality, unwearable second hand clothing coming into the country. The report notes with concern that Kenya and the rest of Africa have become a release valve and a textile dumping ground for countries in the global north as fast fashion and consumerism explode.
Though the Mitumba Consortium of Kenya maintains that only 2 percent of second hand apparel imports are of low quality, Changing Markets Foundation and Clean Up Kenya report that over 40 percent of these imports are unwearable.
As it is, Kenya lacks the infrastructure, systems and policies to manage textile waste. As second hand clothes and shoes pile up in our markets and homes, we lack a clear direction on where to take them at the end of their life cycle.
A Kenyan company is working hard to change this. DN2 Property had a chat with Alex Musembi, the Co-founder and General Manager, Africa Collect Textiles (ACT). ACT is diverting thousands of kilograms of textile waste from landfills and rivers through a unique business model that turns the waste into home decor and other products. Musembi shares their journey:
Early Detection
“The history of ACT goes back to 2013 when we started thinking about textile waste. The company’s full-time operations however started in 2020. Before starting the company, I was working for a Dutch non-profit, textile collecting company which had operations in Kenya. In Europe, companies collect materials and clothes which are sorted and dispatched or shipped to Africa in bales and sold as second hand clothing. I was part of that value chain. The company also had a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) program supporting different initiatives. One of them was a knitting project in Kenya and I was in charge of it as the General Manager.
The motivation behind ACT came from observations I made while working in the second hand clothes’ value chain. I noticed there was a lot of textile waste coming into the country.
As the textiles are collected, sorted and packed into bales, they are also mixed with non-wearable items. These could be stained clothes or low-quality materials. Some of them are unfit for the Kenyan market - they could be too big or too small depending on their country of origin. Kenya is warm most of the months, and some second-hand clothes are designed for much colder weather. Such clothes are a waste when shipped to Kenya because no one can wear them. More than 10 years ago, we could see textile waste becoming a big issue in Kenya and Africa even though most people were unaware of it.
Partnership with Nakumatt
Before setting up the business in 2020, we started with research. We attended accelerator programs, worked on defining our value proposition, and learned how to turn the business into a profitable venture. We put in a lot of legwork to ensure once we hit the ground running, the business would be a success.
Between 2014 and 2015, for instance, we partnered with Nakumatt, a retail giant at the time. Through our strategic partnership with the retailer, we installed our collection bins in their branches. We started with Nakumatt Lifestyle, Mega and TRM. People would drop off their old clothes at the collection centres as they came to shop. At the time Nakumatt was way ahead of the retail chain and through the partnership, we worked on a loyalty program. Customers who donated clothes were to earn loyalty points to be redeemed by shopping at the supermarket. Such a program was going to create a win-win situation for everyone. Our main goal was to divert textile waste from landfills while providing the public with a convenient method of disposing of their unused textiles.
The partnership was going very well and we were collecting at least 500 Kilograms of textiles per branch every week. But what we didn’t know is that Nakumatt was on the brink of collapsing at the time. By 2017 they shut down completely. Though our primary goal was to research and test the viability of our business model, we had to rethink our entire model. Still, we learned a lot from the partnership.
Anonymous Donations
We currently have three textile waste collection models. The first one involves placing collection bins in different strategic locations. We have over 40 bins in different estates, malls, shops, institutions, supermarkets and at Gikomba market. The collection bins’ model we are working with is a European contextualised model. In 2012 we conducted research to find out the most convenient way to collect textiles. We interviewed people and one of the things that came out strongly was that they want to donate anonymously. This is tied to African cultures and beliefs. People feel uncomfortable sharing their clothes with others casually. Some people hold spiritual beliefs and that leads to a hoarding culture.
This is one of the reasons we decided to set up donation bins in different locations to minimise face-to-face interactions between donors and collectors.
Along the way, some people suggested door-to-door pickup. Not everyone can access our bins. We started scheduling pick-up days for different estates with our van. The door-to-door pick-ups became our second collection model.
The third model provides solutions for corporates. A lot of companies are becoming environmentally conscious. Previously, businesses would burn their old uniforms, but that is not sustainable anymore. Donating these uniforms is not an option either, for security reasons. They have company logos and if they end up in the wrong hands they could be misused through impersonation. We are currently providing several security companies and other corporations with a safe and sustainable alternative for disposing of old textiles.
The upcycling and reusing process
Once the textiles are collected and they make it to our facility, we sort them into wearables and non-wearables. The wearables have to flow back to the market if they are good enough to be reused. We sell them to women in rural areas such as Murang’a, Mwea, Meru and parts of Nairobi at an affordable price. Delivering the clothes to them increases their profitability. Most importantly we are giving these clothes a longer life cycle instead of wasting them.
The non-wearable textiles are used as raw materials for our line of products. We have specialised in home decor products like pillows, lumbar pillows, duvets, cushions, chairs, rugs, carpets, toys, backpacks and baskets. We also have a B2B arrangement through which we help companies create branded merchandise from their upcycled uniforms or textiles.
Beyond Home Decor
Our first range products were rugs, tapestries and carpets. We are the first company to upcycle denim and unwanted textiles into home decor products. Family is also an integral part of our business model. We needed to make products that are family friendly. We started with the African Queen Rug, and it is one of our best selling products to date.
We are currently scaling to mechanical recycling. We want to recycle more than a million kilograms annually. Our mechanical recycling process will involve producing fillings through a downscaling process which breaks down textiles into fine fibres. These fibres can be used as raw materials for yarn or as fillings for sofas, puffer jackets, toys and pillows. Currently, the fillings we use in Kenya are imported from abroad and that means we are not creating jobs. Our money is building other economies. If Africa Collect Textiles can produce enough fillings by recycling textiles, we will not only divert textile waste from dumping sites but also create jobs for Kenyans.
The challenges
Despite our success, we’ve jumped through several hurdles. The biggest issue when it comes to doing business in Kenya, especially manufacturing, is the cost of operations. Things like fuel, water, electricity and labour are expensive and that makes local businesses uncompetitive in the global market. Regulatory issues are also a challenge. Sometimes the regulatory agencies create bottlenecks for businesses. Issues such as corruption and demands for kickbacks sabotage manufacturing in the country.
In the beginning, lack of awareness was a big problem. Social behaviour change is needed for this model to work. Helping people understand why they should not throw away their old clothes and shoes requires lots of awareness efforts. It’s a new concept and it takes time for people to accept it.
Lastly, no one has done this kind of business in Kenya. We are the first company collecting, sorting and upcycling textile waste. There is no data to refer to. We have to define numbers such as how much textile waste is out there, how many kilograms we can collect and how much we can process. No one has commercialised the textile waste sector like we have and that makes it unattractive to investors or venture capitalists, due to lack of crucial data.
Designing the products and getting the right professionals to work at the factory has not been easy either. Tailors and weavers are used to making different products and now we are exposing them to a very unique line of products and it takes training to get perfect products. Overall, it’s not an easy business.
Changing buyer behaviour
Regardless of these challenges, we have several distributors in Kenya like the Secret Garden Shop, African Lifestyle Hub and the Village Market. We are still trying to scale up in other Kenyan locations.
We also sell in several European markets. In the Netherlands we have a distributor called Nic & Mic. We have a B2B partnership with the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust. In German, we sell through a shop called MultiCulti. In Italy, we have partnered with Ultramoda. Buyers in European markets are slightly ahead when it comes to upcycling and buying sustainable and ethically produced products. Kenyans are also becoming conscious of these things but we still need to catch up.
Impact and Global Partnerships
So far, we have diverted more than 150,000 kilograms of textile waste from landfills. We have also created over 120 jobs by working with women who weave our baskets, and full-time jobs for those working in our facilities. By estimates, we have reduced about 921 trillion tonnes of carbon emissions. We are also driving social change and now, the people who work and buy from our brand understand the importance of increasing the life cycle of textiles.
We are also forming more strategic partnerships with groundbreaking innovators. There is a company in Switzerland called Winter & Company. It’s in the stationery industry and they’ve been around since 1892. They have an innovative experiment geared toward making paper out of textile waste and we are shipping textiles to them from Kenya. Such a partnership creates a lot of value. By buying our unwearable textiles, they are helping us divert them from clogging up our rivers and oceans. The paper they are producing is also revolutionary as it will save trees which are the primary raw material for paper.
Moving forward, I am optimistic about scaling ACT as a pioneer in diverting textile waste from landfills. For the next three years, we hope to set up 10 new collection points each year. We are also creating more awareness to scale up the amount of waste we are collecting and process to a million kilograms annually. Scaling up means more jobs. We’ve also partnered with an organisation called Ethical Fashion. They will be operating from our facility, buying textiles from us and producing sustainable fashion products for some of the biggest brands in the world.",2024-07-11
https://nation.africa/kenya/news/gender/inside-gender-policies-that-are-transforming-counties-4685936,"What you need to know:
- County governments are taking the lead in promoting gender equality through tailored policies.
- Makueni, Kajiado, Meru, Migori, Kisumu, Isiolo, and most recently, Nyeri counties have emerged as pioneers of county gender policies.
- These policies are already showing tangible results, from increased support for SGBV survivors to greater women's participation in local government.
Fatuma Nyerere's eyes light up as she recounts the changes she's witnessed in Kisumu County over the past few years. As a human rights defender in Kaloleni estate, she's seen first-hand the impact of the county's new gender policies on the lives of women and girls.
""The sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) policy has been a godsend,"" Fatuma says, her voice brimming with enthusiasm.
""Survivors are finally accessing justice. Our success rate in these cases has soared to 75 per cent, thanks to the policy's advocacy and awareness campaigns.""
Fatuma's story is just one thread in a larger tapestry of change. From the shores of Lake Victoria to the plains of Kajiado, from the highlands of Nyeri to the beaches of Homa Bay, a quiet revolution is unfolding. County governments are taking bold steps to address gender disparities and protect their most vulnerable citizens.
Seven counties - Makueni, Kajiado, Meru, Migori, Kisumu, Isiolo, and most recently, Nyeri - have emerged as pioneers, adopting comprehensive gender policies tailored to their unique challenges. This shift towards gender-inclusive governance is gaining momentum, driven by a growing recognition that gender equality is not just a matter of fairness, but a cornerstone of development.
As Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga said during the launch of his county's policy, ""We're creating a more equitable society, ensuring equal access to education, healthcare, economic opportunities, and political participation.""
Each county's approach is as diverse as Kenya itself. In Kajiado, the focus is on eradicating female genital mutilation (FGM), a deeply entrenched practice that has long cast a shadow over the region.
Beatrice Sontai, an FGM survivor turned activist from Kiserian, has witnessed the impact of Kajiado's anti-FGM policy first-hand.
""Since 2019, we've seen robust campaigns led by the county and its partners,"" she explains. ""The drop in FGM cases has been significant.""
The policy's strength lies in its community-centred approach. By fostering dialogues and interventions that engage every community member, Kajiado is slowly but surely turning the tide against this harmful practice.
Jeremiah Kipainoi, another anti-FGM activist working across Kajiado and Narok, emphasises the critical role of political will and resources.
""Political goodwill is the backbone of our fight against FGM,"" he asserts. ""But it must be coupled with adequate budgetary allocation. Only then can our campaigns truly achieve their intended purpose.""
Kisumu County, on the other hand, is taking a comprehensive approach to gender equality. Their focus spans a broad spectrum: from combating sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) to promoting women's empowerment and mainstreaming gender across all sectors.
In 2019, the county became the second in Kenya to launch an SGBV policy, marking a significant milestone in the fight for gender equality. Beatrice Odongo, the County Executive Committee (CEC) Member for Gender, Culture and Tourism, explains the policy's far-reaching impact:
""We're not just tackling violence; we're reshaping our society,"" Beatrice says. ""This policy creates robust support mechanisms for survivors while ensuring that SGBV laws are stringently enforced at the grassroots level.""
The results have been transformative. SGBV steering committees and technical working groups now provide strategic direction, implementing laws and mobilizing resources for protection, prevention, and response initiatives.
But Kisumu's gender revolution extends beyond addressing violence. The county's Gender Mainstreaming Policy has opened doors for women in public service. In a recent hiring of revenue officers, nearly a third of the 375 positions went to women - a marked improvement from previous years.
Beatrice's pride is palpable as she outlines the progress: ""Gender inclusion is becoming our norm. Four out of our ten county executive members are women now. We've also established a gender mainstreaming committee with representatives from every department.""
Physical violence
These initiatives couldn't be timelier. The 2022 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey paints a sobering picture of the challenges women in Kisumu face. Eleven percent of women aged 15-49 years reported experiencing sexual violence, with seven percent suffering such abuse in the past year alone. Even more alarming, over a third of women in this age group have experienced physical violence since turning 15, with a quarter facing it in the last year.
In the heart of central Kenya, Nyeri County is also charting a new course with its recently launched gender policy. This comprehensive initiative tackles a spectrum of issues, from SGBV to women's political representation.
Esther Ndung'u, the CEC member for gender and social services, doesn't shy away from the challenges.
""We're still grappling with SGBV incidents that hinder our development,"" she admits. ""But our policy takes a systemic approach, addressing the root causes and enabling factors of gender-based violence.""
The county's strategy is multifaceted. They've trained 40 GBV community champions and established a technical working group that brings together national and county stakeholders. The group meets quarterly to strategize on eradicating GBV.
""We're not just treating symptoms,"" Esther explains. ""We're introducing behavioural and attitude change programs to eliminate harmful cultural practices at their source.""
Nyeri's policy also aims to break the glass ceiling in politics. While progress has been made in appointive positions - three out of ten cabinet members and four out of 13 chief officers are women - elective positions lag behind. The 2022 General Election saw only three women win county assembly seats through the ballot, with ten more nominated by the majority party.
To address this disparity, the policy seeks to strengthen affirmative action programs. As stated in the Gender and Development Policy 2021-2025, ""We're ensuring equality and women's empowerment across social, economic, political, and cultural spheres.""
Further in Nyanza, Homa Bay County launched its SGBV policy in March with an ambitious goal: to halve SGBV cases within five years.
Dolphin Ochere, the County Gender Chief Officer, has already seen its impact.
""This policy is a powerful educational tool,"" Dolphin says. ""It's enlightening our residents, especially women and girls, about their rights and the steps to take when vulnerable community members are at risk.""
Surprisingly, the policy's reach has extended beyond its initial target. ""We're seeing men open up about domestic abuse they face,"" Dolphin reveals, shedding light on an often-overlooked aspect of the issue.
The county is taking innovative steps to ensure the policy's accessibility. Gender issues are now a staple in community engagement meetings, and there are plans to translate the policy into Swahili, Braille, and Olusuba, a language spoken by the Abasuba community on Lake Victoria's islands.
However, the path to gender equality is not without obstacles. Many counties, including Homa Bay, face financial constraints in implementing and disseminating these policies. The planned translations and wider distribution of the policy document remain hindered by funding challenges.
Some stakeholders argue for even stronger measures. Julius Omuga, Homa Bay County Education Network Coordinator, suggests elevating the policy to an Act, giving it more legal weight. ""The current policy provides guidelines, but an Act would have real teeth,"" he argues.
Basra Hassan, a program officer with the Community Aid Transformation Alliance Group, agrees on the need for strengthening the policy. However, she acknowledges the financial hurdles that could impede such efforts.
Despite the hurdles, the transformative impact of these gender policies is undeniable. Across the country, they are fostering safer, more equitable communities where women and girls can flourish.
Take Kajiado, for instance where the anti-FGM policy transcends mere law enforcement. It's a catalyst for changing deeply rooted cultural perceptions. By engaging community leaders, educators, and families, the county is not just banning a practice – it's shifting attitudes and promoting alternative rites of passage for girls.
Gender equality
In Kisumu and Nyeri, the approach to SGBV is equally nuanced. Rather than relying solely on punitive measures, their policies emphasise prevention through education and awareness-raising.
The ripple effects of these policies extend far beyond their immediate focus. By promoting gender equality and women's empowerment, they're contributing to broader development goals. Research consistently shows that when women have equal access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities, entire communities thrive.
For women like Fatuma Nyerere in Kisumu and Beatrice Sontai in Kajiado, the impact of the gender policies is already palpable. These policies aren't just documents – they're beacons of hope, illuminating the path towards a more equitable future for all Kenyans.",2024-07-10
https://nation.africa/kenya/news/report-majority-of-the-homeless-are-men--4686626,"A new report by the National Council for Population and Development (NCPD) shows that men make up more than half of the homeless in Kenya.
According to the report, out of 10 homeless people, eight are men, as indicated in the Sessional Paper No.1 of 2023 on Kenya National Population Policy for Sustainable Development.
According to the Fifth Sessional paper, men make up 80 per cent of the homeless people in the country, with 42 individuals out of 100,000 being homeless.
Men in the country also rank highly among other vulnerable populations, including persons with disabilities and total orphans.
“Homelessness is often considered a sign and cause of poverty and social exclusion. The main issues affecting this segment of the population are lack of residence, poverty, health, education and social integration,” stated NCPD Director-General Mohamed Sheikh.
In terms of homelessness, men are followed by children aged five years.
Speaking during the report launch in Nairobi, Dr Sheikh implored the government to “explore effective measures for settling homeless persons”.
Main concerns
The report has listed vulnerability to poor health, insecurity and poor access to social amenities as the main concerns facing the destitute in the country.
At the same time, the number of homeless people in the country has increased by nearly twofold in a span of five years.
The Kenya Population and Housing Census 2019 enumerated 20,101 homeless people, which is less than 1 per cent of the total population in the country.
Presently, a total of 46,639 Kenyans are living on the streets, with Nairobi County leading with the highest number at 15,337.
Other counties with a large number of homeless persons, according to the report, include Mombasa (7,529), Kisumu (2,746), Uasin Gishu (2,147) and Nakuru (2,005).
Vulnerability
“This category of the population is found in all the segments of the population,” the report reads in part. “Vulnerability results from orphanhood, disability or difficulty in performing activities of daily life, social discrimination associated with intersex, and homelessness due to displacement or poverty.”
Kenya is now ranked as a Low Middle Income Country and the ninth largest economy in the African continent. However, 18 per cent of the population in Kenya lives in squalor, spending below $1.98 (Sh255) daily according to a 2022 World Bank report.
The rate of unemployment has also increased in the last decade to 5.5 per cent in 2019 from 3 per cent in 1999, according to the report.
The report, however, shows a sharp decline in the number of children engaged in illegal employment.
“The proportion of children engaged in labour declined from 35 per cent in 2014 to 9 per cent in 2022. Labour force participation rate among the working age is estimated at 77 per cent,” it states.
Labour force participation rate, as explained in the NCPD report, is “a measure of the proportion of a country’s working-age population that engages actively in the labour market, either by working or looking for work”.
Through its newly launched policy, NCPD has called upon both the national and county governments to ensure the integration of population issues in efforts to address various areas of concern.",2024-07-11
https://nation.africa/kenya/counties/muranga/-angry-mob-kills-murder-suspect-as-police-officers-take-to-their-heels-4686580,"Irate residents of Gachocho village in Murang’a County on Wednesday, July 10, raided a police patrol base, and stoned officers who fled, before dragging a murder suspect out of the cells and murdering him.
The locals said an eye for an eye was the only sure justice for them since they have no faith in the police stationed in the area.
Kigumo police boss Kiprono Tanui said that trouble started on Tuesday night when three brothers quarrelled over a domestic issue, a fight ensued, and one died.
“It is alleged that two brothers ganged up against their sibling and assaulted him, resulting in his death. When the matter was reported, officers were sent to arrest one of the brothers as a prime suspect since the other had fled,” he said.
Mr Tanui added that when neighbours learnt of the incident, they armed themselves with crude weapons and stormed the Gachocho police patrol base, demanding to be handed the suspect in custody.
“Of course, that was an impossible request, and our officers declined. The residents stoned the officers, they even used catapults. The officers manning the patrol base were overwhelmed,” he said.
Mr Tanui identified the dead brothers as Kibugu wa Richard and Maina wa Richard, who was killed at the police post.
Police cells
He said that as officers fled for dear life, the residents broke into the police cells, dragged the suspect out and stoned him to death.
“When reinforcement arrived, it was too late. Teargas and other crowd control methods were used, but we were unable to rescue the suspect, who, unfortunately, succumbed to injuries inflicted by the mob,” Mr Tanui said.
The rowdy residents attempted to take the body, saying they wanted to bury it in a public cemetery without any ceremony.
“We were able to prevent the residents from taking the body. A postmortem will be done as investigations progress. We have started investigations to establish the people who attacked the police and murdered the suspect. We will make sure we get the other suspect who fled,” he said, adding that the bodies of the two brothers were taken to Murang’a County mortuary.
The family's spokesman, Elijah Nduati, said: “We are saddened by this turn of events...These brothers have never loved one another and their quarrelling is historical.”
“We now have two bodies to bury and another son hiding and whose fate is uncertain...God, this is raw grief,” he added.
Police boss Catherine Ringera from the neighbouring Kahuro Sub-County said that the missing brother had surrendered at the station in the afternoon.
An advocate of the High Court, Timothy Mwangi, told Nation.Africa that police patrol bases are not gazetted to legally hold suspects.
“Once officers in these patrol bases arrest suspects, they are supposed to transfer them to any nearby gazetted police station. In this case, the suspect who was killed was supposed to have been taken to Kigumo Police Station,” he said.
Negative emotions
“Due diligence is supposed to be exercised by police officers once they arrest a suspect linked to serious crime, since they are bound to invite negative emotions from members of the public,” he added.
Area Nyumba Kumi community policing initiative member Martin Mburu said the crowd was enormous for the police to restrain it. He said they were overpowered and ran for their lives.
“It was dramatic. The crowd gained access into the police station and fished out the suspect and murdered him...That is what happens when a society loses trust in the system,” he added.
Murang'a Senator Joe Nyutu said the incident was a shame and called on police officers to always be accountable.
""This is evidence of the collapse of the rule of law. When residents resort to go after suspects in custody and proceed to lynch them outside police stations, it tells a story about how they rate security personnel...it is scaring,"" he said.
He said the same frustrations are being experienced in the crop and livestock thefts ""where residents tired of waiting for government response have resorted to patrolling their homesteads and shambas and ending up lynching suspects that they nab"".
Mr Nyutu said ""Our security officers must get on top of these incidents and give our people a reason to believe in due process instead of resorting to jungle law"".",2024-07-10
https://nation.africa/kenya/news/politics/don-t-engage-raila-kahiga-mutahi-tells-president-ruto-4686518,"Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga has urged President William Ruto to abandon the national dialogue aimed at resolving issues raised by young protesters and instead focus on addressing the concerns of Generation Z.
Speaking at the county's Annual Department Performance Contracts signing ceremony, Mr Kahiga criticised the President's decision to engage the opposition regarding the issues raised by the young protesters, calling the move outdated.
""Mr President, wake up and smell the coffee. I have listened to you, and those are outdated methods. The idea of bringing in Mr Raila Odinga is something that Kenyans grew tired of long ago—he has been brought in too many times. The same applies for Kalonzo Musyoka. This is a new era, and I know you read the Bible; new wine and old wineskins don’t mix. If we are dealing with new wine, we need new wineskins,” he said.
According to Mr Kahiga, the discussions involving Dr Ruto, DP Rigathi Gachagua and several leaders from both the government and the opposition, including Mr Odinga and Mr Musyoka, will not yield any different results.
He expressed disappointment that the demands of Generation Z have not been addressed, with the President only setting up a 150-member task force to negotiate. He warned that if the state continues with the talks, it is the young people and Kenyans who will suffer.
“As leaders, let us engage with the young people and stop branding them names. Stop using derogatory terms while defining them. If indeed their demands are unreasonable, let us explain to them,” he said.
During the ceremony, which was attended by managing directors of the five water service providers (WSP) in the county and county government staff, Mr Kahiga also criticised politicians who have allegedly sidelined the Deputy President.
He noted that the seclusion of DP Rigathi by the government has only strengthened his bond with the electorate and urged President Ruto to allow the DP to perform his constitutional duties with respect befitting the office.
“We request the President to allow his DP to be who he was elected to be during the August 9, 2022 elections,” he said.
He also advised the President to consult with his deputy and the cabinet to find modern and innovative ways to address concerns raised by Kenyans.
On administration of the devolved unit, the county boss ordered departments to avoid starting new projects before completing the ongoing ones unless they are adequately funded. He also instructed department heads to sell or donate idle and unserviceable assets to raise surplus revenue.",2024-07-11
https://nation.africa/kenya/news/my-hands-are-tied-cs-nakhumicha-on-the-question-of-intern-doctors-4686576,"Health Cabinet Secretary Susan Nakhumicha has said that her hands are tied on the posting and payment of medical interns.
She announced that the government will immediately start posting some 552 interns at the Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC) recommended rate of Sh70,000 per month as she awaits the outcome of a court case on the same matter on September 26.
Speaking to the Nation on Tuesday evening and through a statement, the CS apologised to the interns for the pain, anguish, psychological torture and frustration they have endured for almost two years.
“The Ministry of Health (MoH) is cognizant of the negative impact created by the continued delays in the posting of interns. We empathise with our young doctors, who have had to endure untold psychological trauma and financial hardship, even as we work round the clock to find a practical solution to the prevailing situation,” she said.
The CS explained that the return-to-work agreement signed by the government and the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU) on May 8 contained a proposal on how to unlock the stalemate.
“Whereas KMPDU preferred that an intern be posted based on the 2017 collective bargaining agreement (CBA) rates of Sh206,400 per month, the realities of the fiscal space coupled with the withdrawal of the Finance Bill 2024 cannot permit this,” Ms Nakhumicha said.
She added that it is the desire of the ministry to post all the interns immediately, which is why it will begin by posting 552 interns immediately, with the rest following as more resources become available.
The CS noted that since January 2023, the ministry has posted 4,156 interns across the six cadres, including 1,735 doctors— 1,214 medical officers, 496 pharmacists and 25 dentists at a monthly pay of Sh206,400.
According to the ministry, the exponential increase in the number of training institutions churning graduates, the cost of internship has progressively outstripped the available financial resources. This, it said, had created a growing backlog of graduates awaiting posting.
The CS further disclosed that the court case notwithstanding, the parties agreed to continue pursuing a consensus within 60 days that ended on Sunday.
“So far numerous meetings have been held with good progress made towards achieving consensus. Of note is that both parties agree on the need for the interns to be posted without further delay,” she said.
Ms Nakhumicha acknowledged the impact of the delayed postings and advised the interns across the cadres to report to their internship centres pending the resolution of the pay issue.
The CS assured Kenyans that the ongoing discussions between KMPDU and the Health Ministry, and all other consultations with relevant government departments and agencies, will resolve the current impasse and see the young doctors get their careers back on track.
“Following the gazettement of the presidential task force to address long-standing issues on human resources for health, the ministry is optimistic that the task force will come up with recommendations on how to deal with the internship issue permanently, “she said.
KMPDU Secretary-General Davji Atellah maintained that they would go back to the streets if all intern issues are not fully addressed.",2024-07-11
https://nation.africa/kenya/life-and-style/how-we-broke-into-international-markets-female-entrepreneurs-share-their-secrets-4686560,"One of the most common gaps in entrepreneurship is gender gap. While many women in Africa, are entrepreneurs, very few of their businesses are likely to attract investment, go global, and scale.
And while access to finance is a big barrier, the major issues that women-led SMEs face are non-financial.
“We spoke to the women founders, and they told us, ‘yes, we need access to finance'. That's a big thing. But then there is also the non-financial stuff. Like; how do you make sure you have a business continuity plan? How do you make sure that your mental wellness is okay? How do you interact with the different organisations and the government? What about branding, sourcing and keeping employees happy?’” said Elizabeth Wasunna, the Absa Bank Kenya business banking director.
Ms Wasunna says the three things that matter most to women entrepreneurs are access to finance, networks and mentorship, and coaching.
These issues hinder women-led businesses, especially when it comes to accessing emerging markets and attracting investors and, therefore, their companies remain small.
Ms Wasunna was speaking at the 2034 Absa InspireMe Conference where in partnership with International Trade Centre (ITC) SheTrades where 10,000 businesswomen from across Africa gathered in Nairobi. At the event, African women businesses were connected to 11 global buyers and 20 large African corporations.
To understand the challenges African women entrepreneurs, face while scaling businesses, Lifestyle spoke to five women who have grown their businesses across borders. They give practical advice on how to get women out of their comfort zones and reach new heights.
Veronicah Gakio, founder Ankole Jewels, makes jewellery from horn, brass, and semi-precious stones. It also produces crotchet bags finished with genuine Kenyan leather. Sells in Kenya, UAE, and the US
“I started my business in November 2019, right before Covid. Though I worked in human resources in Dubai for nine years, I loved unique jewellery. When I came back to Kenya, I worked for a company that was making jewellery which inspired me to start my own company.
I have always wanted to have that piece of jewellery that nobody else has. In my early 20s, I'd buy jewellery and then combine it with others for unique pieces. And that's precisely what I offer in my brand—custom-made pieces. I'm focused on the unique aspect of my items.
I started by bootstrapping from my savings. The beauty of my business is that if someone gives me a big order, they have to pay 50 percent upfront.
While my company is fairly young, I have clients not only from Kenya but also from the United Arab Emirates, the US and even India. It’s a 50/50 split between retailers and resellers. In my business, the international market does better because that's where I get most clients.
I feel like foreigners, especially in the US, appreciate more hand-made items and the sentiment of ‘one-person trash is another one treasure’.
What has helped me scale fairly quickly is the power of social media. Most clients visit my Instagram page and order the items, which I courier to them. I do sponsored posts on Instagram and decide which location to focus on. One has to target the right audience with each post. But sometimes, as much as we try, we may get the wrong audience.
The biggest challenge I face, like most of the exporters, is the high airfreight costs. For example, the price of shipping a pair of earrings can be equivalent to their price.
I would tell those wanting to scale not to limit themselves and try to be as unique as possible. Don't just go for something quick to make.
Do things that stand out. Be unique. It might be expensive to make unique things, but it pays at the end of the day because people identify you. Network as much as possible. Don't shy away from talking to people, thinking that you're disturbing them. Sell yourself.
Don't limit yourself; talk about your brand. Introduce yourself, and what you do, and people will appreciate what you're doing.”
Anita Kittoe, Oye Bags and Clothing founder: from hobby to empowering local artisans
Anita Kittoe, the creative director and founder of Oye Bags and Clothing in Accra, Ghana, has transformed her side hobby into a flourishing business over the past eight years. Initially working full-time in banking, Anita crafted tote bags and clothes in her spare time.
“It started as a hobby and then five years into it, I left banking and then I've been doing it full-time since,” Anita says.
This transition has enabled her to travel, network, and collaborate with other entrepreneurs globally, including trips to Egypt and Kenya. “We sell in the UK, US, Ghana and Kenya. Our focus from last year is to expand within the continent,” Anita says.
Oye Bags and Clothing is also a platform that supports local artisans and suppliers. “Not only is the business generating income but also creating a livelihood for local artisans, and suppliers who supply raw materials,” she says.
Anita says collaboration with stakeholders has been instrumental in expanding her business and accessing new markets.
“I am a member of SheTrades, Ghana Export Promotion Agency, and Ghana Enterprises Agency. Ghana Trade House was launched in Kenya by GEPA and this has enabled SMEs to access the market,” she says.
Attending international events, and trade fairs and doing pop-up markets have been crucial in Oye's growth. These events offer networking opportunities and inspiration from like-minded entrepreneurs.
“Meeting others who have faced and overcome similar challenges provides motivation and reinforces the belief that growth and success are attainable,” she says.
Oye Bags and Clothing currently operates two shops in Accra and has stockists in the US and the UK, including locations in Atlanta, New York, and London. The brand also leverages online sales, shipping products worldwide via DHL.
“Social media has been very good to us since many people today don't like going to shops,” she says.
Anita says financing has been a significant challenge, and she initially relied on her salary, high-interest microfinance loans, and support from family and friends.
“Ghana interest rates are super high—35-40 percent. I just signed off on a loan and the interest rate is almost 40 percent,” Anita who says access to grants has eased her burden, shares.
Anita emphasises the importance of organic growth and patience. Aspiring exporters should develop their products to meet international standards and grow naturally to avoid overextending their capacity. Ensuring product quality and readiness for the global market is also paramount.
“You need to develop your product to a certain level and be confident that your product is ready for the international market. There are all of these regulations out there. You need to check with your local agencies and be sure that your product is safe to go out in the first,” she advises.
Anita notes the difficulties in collecting payments and the complexities of shipping products within Africa compared to markets like the UK and the US. Addressing these issues is crucial for smoother expansion and operational efficiency.
“It’s as simple as ‘how do I get paid? This is a major problem across Africa. It's easy for someone to send me money from the UK than from here in Kenya. So one has to figure out a way,” she says.
Francesca B. Apeagyei, Nguvu Global co-founder: Empowering women and expanding shea cosmetics across continents
Francesca B. Apeagyei, alongside her sister, co-founded Nguvu Global Limited, a social enterprise based in Accra, Ghana. Specialising in shea cosmetics and natural oils, Nguvu operates a processing centre in northern Ghana, where shea nuts grow wild.
Here, they support 1,500 women from nearby communities who pick and process the shea nuts into butter, which Nguvu Global then buys, processes further with natural oils and fragrances, and exports.
Nguvu Global's shea cosmetics are available in Melcom, Ghana's largest supermarket chain, and at the Accra airports, among other local shops. Internationally, they extend their reach to Kenya, Liberia, South Africa, the US, and the UK. This impressive growth in just four years stems from a blend of strategic location, partnerships, and leveraging local resources.
The business idea originated from Francesca's sister’s research on women in marginalised area development, which highlighted the economic potential of shea butter. Recognising the disparity between resource availability and local poverty, the sisters aimed to create a sustainable and empowering business model.
“She realised that we were sitting on a natural resource that could be catapulted into something large,” says Francesca who shares the company name Nguvu, which means strength in Swahili, symbolises the collective strength of women.
Francesca and her sister have navigated significant challenges, including the Covid-19 pandemic, which led Francesca to pivot from her travel business to focus entirely on shea cosmetics. This period was used to refine product formulations and explore online sales, leading to increased local and international demand.
“The travel business had collapsed, and I was looking for a way to pay the rent. Shea had potential, if we were to put the structures in place in terms of logistics, pricing, packaging, and promotion. I used the lockdown period to test my product on my friends. I would rather test on my friends who won't sue me than random people,” Francesca says of the formulations she started producing from her kitchen counter.
Their international expansion strategy involved leveraging Francesca's marketing expertise and taking calculated risks, such as personally travelling to new markets like South Africa and Kenya to establish connections and understand market needs. Collaborations with the Ghana Export Promotion Authority also played a crucial role in entering new markets, such as through trade shows and establishing trade houses.
Being a female entrepreneur in Ghana presented additional challenges, particularly in accessing finance. Francesca often found that her proposals were not taken seriously by male-dominated financial institutions. To overcome this, she strategically involved a male financial coach in meetings to secure necessary funding.
“They (male executives) look at you like a young girl trying to do business. So they toss you about. Or they are hearing, but they are not listening to you. I decided to go to meetings with a male financial coach because he would speak the mathematics and shake hands and I'll just be quiet and get my money. My work would continue. I found that to be a smart way of getting what I want without having to fight all the time,” she says.
Logistical challenges, particularly high shipping costs and long transit times within Africa have been significant obstacles.
“Business revolves around time. The customers are impatient. If the product is low on stock in Kenya and I need to quickly send stock, it means that by default, if I use flight, I'm going to lose money. That customer is not going to wait 30 to 90 days for shipping. That customer is quickly going to move on to a product that's available and ready on the shelf. It's a tough business call,” she says.
By partnering with government institutions like the Ghana Shippers Authority and GEPA, Nguvu Global has been able to mitigate some of these costs and streamline its shipping processes.
Looking ahead, Nguvu Global aims to solidify its presence in five key African markets—Kenya, South Africa, Egypt, Morocco, and either Uganda or Rwanda—alongside expanding into European and Middle Eastern markets such as Germany and Dubai. The ultimate goal is to position Nguvu Global as a leading African brand in the global cosmetics industry, comparable to European luxury brands.
Francesca emphasises the importance of travel and firsthand market exploration. She advocates for personally visiting new markets to gain practical insights, build connections, and understand consumer preferences.
Adowa Koren Dejean-Lynch, CEO BEEyond Honey Collection: Innovating food security and honey production in Rwanda
Adowa Koren Dejean-Lynch is an African British Caribbean entrepreneur based in Kigali, Rwanda. Her journey to Rwanda began two years ago with a mission to address food insecurity and climate change through innovative agricultural solutions.
Her first product, Microgreens, is a crop that grows in just 14 days using minimal water and no fertilisers, making it ideal for urban settings and small spaces like patios.
A year into her venture, Adowa expanded her focus to pollination, recognising the critical role bees play in crop production. She noticed the discrepancy in honey production between countries like Ethiopia and Rwanda and sought to create a premium honey product that could compete on an international scale. BEEyond Honey Collection blends honey with spices, herbs, and alcohol, creating a unique product range aimed at wellness and premium markets.
“I wanted to produce a premium brand coming out of Africa for the International market,” Adowa who draws inspiration from her African and Caribbean heritage says.
Starting in 2022, Adowa faced significant challenges, from cultural and logistical hurdles to financial constraints. Despite knowing no one in Rwanda and relying on support from her family, she stayed focused and driven.
“What keeps me grounded is being focused. You have to be able to wear many hats. You don't have to be brilliant at your idea, but begin with what you've got. Be prepared to learn and listen because as the business grows you will get people who want to bolt your business and give you the support you need,” Adowa says.
BEEyond Honey Collection's pilot in Rwanda proved successful, leading to plans for expansion into Kenya and beyond. Adowa aims to produce 40,000 units in the first year of full-scale production, positioning her product as a premium brand both in Africa and internationally. She is exploring opportunities for manufacturing in Kenya and has received interest from the SheTrades Initiative for exporting to the UK.
Adowa advises aspiring entrepreneurs to be honest with themselves, stay dedicated, and surround themselves with supportive mentors and peers. She highlights the importance of feedback, adaptability, and maintaining a positive mindset.
“Don't be afraid to ask for help. As women we're so good at being the support that we forget how to say, ‘I can't do this…help me’. I had to learn that. When you go to a new country you're struggling with culture, traditions, currency, and setting up a home….it’s a lot. Ask for help,” Adowa says.
Lydia Wangari, founder Farmplace, expands agricultural exports and embraces community impact
Lydia Wangari says her company specialises in exporting avocados, mangoes, and macadamia nuts. Recently, it has ventured into value-added products such as macadamia and crude avocado oil.
Lydia's passion for agriculture stems from her upbringing in a family of coffee farmers in Kiambu, Kenya.
“We started the business initially with my father. I come from a family of coffee farmers and from where I come from there's a lot of avocados,” says Lydia.
Inspired by the high demand and prices for avocados in the US, where she worked in the nursing industry, Lydia decided to harness the potential of Kenya's rich agricultural landscape.
“Food is something that you can't live without and I mean, avocado is healthy, right? I have a passion for healthy eating. There's a lot of need for avocado in the world. People use avocados for a lot of things—for food, hair products, oil. Avocado oil is a very premium oil,” she says.
Since its inception, Farmplace has expanded its market reach to the Middle East, the Far East, and Europe, exporting to countries like Italy and Germany. Plans are underway to penetrate the US market. Lydia attributes their success to attending trade fairs, understanding customer needs, and securing necessary certifications for the European market. “You have to attend trade fairs. There's a lot of investment in marketing. You have to go outside there, listen to clients, and know their needs. You know, there's some trust when a customer puts a face to the person. And also, it's about, do you know what you're selling? Why are you it?” poses Lydia.
Lydia candidly discusses the challenges faced in the export business, including ensuring product quality and navigating complex payment terms. Initial financing came from her savings, which was later supplemented by support from Absa Bank. The company also benefits from upfront payments by customers, easing financial pressures.
“Financing is very crucial in exports. It's extremely, extremely expensive…I won't lie. But the returns are good.”
To ensure high-quality produce, Lydia emphasises the importance of groundwork and education. She works closely with small-scale farmers, particularly women, providing them with the necessary knowledge and resources to produce export-quality fruits.
“Avocado has a lot of pests. If you don't know, you can pack a lot of rejects. And then your customer sends you a report of what your product looks like. There's a lot of education and groundwork to be done. I engage myself with small-scale farmers, mostly women. Understanding what it is they do, how it’s done, and identifying a group of farmers to work with. It’s not easy.
I've gone even for a whole year not exporting, just gaining information. My father used to do the groundwork but after he passed on three years ago, I had to get out from desktop research and get the information from the ground. I had to pause, go around, learning from people who've done it. Some will share, some will not. There's also pricing, which is difficult. You need to ask somebody to hold your hand. And I can tell you for free, my banker tries to help me a lot.”
Diversification and Future Goals
Recognising the need for diversification, Farmplace Limited has started producing macadamia and avocado oil, which has a high demand locally and internationally. This move helps stabilise the company's income streams and fills gaps in the export market.
“New customers sometimes ask why should I trust you with my money? I use Absa to reach payment terms—we work on a bank-to-bank transaction. Whether the customer's bank and my bank are the intermediaries. I release the documents to my bank, then their bank releases the money. But remember, some of our banks are not in their countries. That’s a major challenge that I am yet to unlock. That's why I've diversified to oil. Because of the beauty with oil, I can also sell locally at a good price,” she says.
Lydia's future goals for the company include expanding production capacity, entering new international markets, and seeing Farmplace products on the shelves of major chain stores globally. She is also deeply committed to empowering women in her community, believing that supporting women can lead to broader community development.
“Groundwork. Networking. Financing,” Lydia says is the key to hacking other markets. The company currently employs four permanent staff and outsources casuals according to their needs.
Lydia stresses the importance of having a clear purpose, investing in information, building strong relationships with banks and customers, and leveraging bank support. Attending trade fairs and seeking guidance from established exporters are also crucial steps. Hiring credible consultants can provide professional insights and aid in navigating the complex export landscape.
“You need information, even more than money. You need to know the prices. What’s the traceability of your fruits? You need to trace in case you get a quality report from your customer. You just don't pick fruit from anywhere. Not all fruits are export quality.
You need to know the licences required and the government bodies involved. To navigate, you can hire a consultant. Walk to the packhouses, and see what's done from A to Z,” she advises.
Lydia's vision is to create a sustainable business that not only thrives in the global market but also uplifts local communities. “I want to see our products on the shelves of major chain stores across the world,” she says.",2024-07-11
https://nation.africa/kenya/news/court-declines-to-temporarily-halt-housing-levy-4686892,"The High Court has declined to temporarily suspend parts of the Affordable Housing Act, including the collection of the levy, saying public interest favours allowing the law to operate until the petitions are decided.
A three-judge bench said that laws enacted by Parliament enjoy a presumption of constitutionality and the court cannot stop them unless it can be shown that there is a real risk of a right being violated.
Six petitions were filed challenging various provisions of the Affordable Housing Act of 2023 and were consolidated before Chief Justice Martha Koome appointed Justices Olga Sewe (presiding), John Chigiti and Josephine Mong'are to hear the cases.
“It is our finding, therefore, that the petitioners have failed to show that the impugned provisions pose a danger to life or limb or that they threaten the Bill of Rights to warrant the orders sought. We are not persuaded that the petition will be rendered nugatory if the orders sought are not granted,” the judges said.
The judges said they had no doubt that the affordable housing levy had generated a lot of public interest with differing arguments as to its constitutionality.
Lack of clarity
The petitioners, among them Dr Magare Gikenyi, had argued that the absence of a board to manage the fund and the lack of clarity about the collector of the levy left the money vulnerable to theft and misappropriation in contravention of Article 10(2) of the Constitution, which provides for principles of national values and good governance, integrity, transparency and accountability.
They also pointed out that the duties of the Commissioner General of the Kenya Revenue Authority are limited to the affairs of the authority and not to the collection of the levy.
The court was further informed that the housing levy was set at 1.5 per cent without a study to show how the fund would operate, yet no money should be collected from the public without an expenditure line and a fully functioning fund established as required by law.
The government defended the law, arguing that every Act of Parliament enjoys the presumption of constitutionality.
Parliament also argued that the Act provides a legal framework for the levy and that the imposition of levies is not unusual in Kenya. It cited the Road Maintenance Levy and the Petroleum Levy as examples of such initiatives.",2024-07-11
https://nation.africa/kenya/news/nairobi-hospital-saga-why-lobby-wants-entire-board-recalled-4686766,"The wrangling at Nairobi Hospital has taken a new turn as members of the Kenya Hospital Association (KHA), the organisation that owns the hospital, have called for an extraordinary general meeting to remove more than 10 directors from the board, citing a loss of confidence in their leadership.
In a petition addressed to the board of KHA, members of the requisition group listed 13 directors, including chairman Chris Bichage and vice chairman Philemon Mwaisaka, alleging that they have failed in their legal and fiduciary duties to the company and its interests.
""The cited failures of the board include, but are not limited to: collectively passing resolutions to accept and issue tenders contrary to the hospital's procurement manual, to be financed by offshore borrowing of astronomical sums of an estimated Sh2 billion, using the company's assets as collateral without informing or obtaining the approval of the members, without considering alternative financing, thereby jeopardising the company's assets and in fact the existence of the company should the company be unable to repay the astronomical proposed loans,"" reads the petition drafted by the KHA requisition committee.
""We, the undersigned, representing more than one-tenth of the total voting rights of all members of the Kenya Hospital Association (the company) entitled to vote at the general meetings of the company as at the date of this letter, hereby serve and request you in terms of article 18 of the company's articles of association and section 277 of the Companies Act, 2015 to convene an extraordinary general meeting of the company for the purpose of removing the unlisted directors from the board,"" it added.
The members have faulted Dr Bichage and Mr Mwaisaka for failure in leadership and, management of the company, which involved leading and presiding over meetings of the Board of Management in making resolutions that have been against the company’s Articles of Association, Human resource manual and procurement manual.
In addition, the duo has been accused of acting in serious conflict of interest and in contravention of the Articles of Association of the company, by conducting business with the company using proxy companies and failure in leadership and management of the company, resulting in serious decline in performance, revenues, efficiency and brand standing of the hospital.
“In those premises, the Hon. Dr Chris M. N. Bichage and Mr Philemon Mwaisaka are not suitable to continue as a director and or chairman of the Board and vice chairman of the Board respectively,” the petition read in parts.
As the chair of the human resources committee of the board of management, Barcley M. Onyambu has been accused of presiding over irregular employment of staff at the Hospitals, based on tribalism, nepotism, and cronyism, and in contravention of the company’s human resource manual and board charter.
Others directors include; Dr David Githanga, Dr W. Irungu Ndirangu, Dr Magdalene Muthoka, Mrs Ludmilla Shitakha, Dr Fred Kambuni, Dr Mbira Gikonyo, Hon Philip Waki, Prof. Herman B Manyora, Prof. John Mwero and Mr Geoffrey Ng’etich.
To this effect, the member of KHA has maintained that it was urgent to scrap off the entire board to help salvage the Hospital before it is declared insolvent.
“It is critically urgent and necessary to the removal of the Board of management and reconstitution thereof with a capable Board to save the Hospital and the company,” read the petition.
According to the KHA board requisition committee, the recalling of the directors has reached an advanced stage despite a continuous threatening letter from the company’s secretary of KHA, Gilbert Nyamweya, under instruction from the current board chairman.
In a letter dated July 1, 2024, seen by this publication, the committee, through its lawyer Ahmednasir M Abdullahi, SC has already written to Mr Nyamweya to unconditionally and immediately desist from interfering with the ongoing process for the recall of an extraordinary meeting terming it a legal process.
""We are now at an advanced stage in the process of recalling the KHA board. However, we are also aware of the ongoing threatening letters from the company secretary of KHA on the instructions of the current chairman of the board that we are recalling.
These are just threats with no legal substance. It is a desperate attempt by the board to avoid a legitimate recall by KHA members. The recall has followed due process as set out in the Companies Act and is therefore valid,"" the committee said.
In the latest development, in a public notice, KHA has issued a stern warning to Kenyans about a fraudulent syndicate of individuals posing as Nairobi Hospital employees.
In the advisory advert placed by the association, it warned that the individuals were unlawfully soliciting members’ personal data with the individuals operating out of various hospitality establishments in Nairobi, misleading the public.
""KHA wishes to disassociate itself from this syndicate of individuals and their unlawful solicitation of KHA members' details. Please report any such solicitation of your details to the KHA office for action by law enforcement agencies,"" the advert advised.
In the same advert, the association published pictures and names of two former employees, Mr Victor Opiyo Miseda who was the Chief Operations Officer at the hospital and Engineer Shammah Kiteme, who was the Chief Engineer.
The warning indicated that the two ceased to be employees of Kenya Hospital Association trading as the Nairobi Hospital with effect from June 12th and June 30threspectively and they are therefore not authorized to transact any business in the same of or on behalf of KHA.
""Any person who deals with the two or their agents or servants as an apparent representative of KHA or the hospital does so at their own risk. We advise our stakeholders, including KHA members and the general public, to act with caution and disregard any communication made by the above person on behalf of the hospital,"" the advisory warned.
A call and text message to the hospital's chief executive officer inquiring about the specifics of what the individuals had done went unanswered.
Speaking to this publication, Robert Shaw, the former board member of KHA, attributed the move, to a campaign to silence and intimidate the competent practitioners who have always not been not bowed to intimidation, and also scare the few doctors who form the minority of the employed doctors in the hospital.
""They are very competent and independent people. So the move is just to threaten them while the management is trying to stop the process of recalling the directors. Most of the doctors are not employees of the hospital, they are consultants,"" Mr Shaw said in a telephone interview.
To successfully recall the board of management, the members need a minimum of 300 signatures, which Mr Shaw says has already been attained.
In its latest report in the financial year ended December 2022, Nairobi Hospital made a loss of Sh564.7 million attributing the loss to a fall in patient numbers.",2024-07-11
https://nation.africa/kenya/news/education/kuppet-teachers-turned-away-from-hospitals-due-to-unpaid-insurance-dues-4686572,"The Kenya Union of Post-Primary Education Teachers (Kuppet) has demanded the immediate reinstatement of the withdrawn medical insurance scheme for tutors.
The union said health facilities under the scheme had announced the suspension of services with effect from Monday, July 8 and that some of its members had been denied services in regions such as Vihiga, Nyeri, Nairobi, and Mombasa.
“As of Monday, July 8, nearly all private and mission hospitals accredited under the scheme had stopped providing services to teachers and their dependants. Only public hospitals now offer services to teachers, yet these are too few and often lack equipment or reagents for lab tests, and even the process of seeing doctors is a problem,” said Mr Moses Nthurima, Kuppet’s acting secretary-general.
The union has also demanded that the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) explain to the country why teachers are suffering despite the huge investment by the government in the medical insurance scheme.
Human dignity
“Many teachers have been forced to pay for services out of their own pockets, while others are being detained in various hospitals that have withdrawn their inpatient healthcare services,” the trade unionist said.
The teachers, Mr Nthurima added “are supposed to attend to students and they cannot because they are sick.”
“Whereas the government has paid a whopping Sh15 billion towards the medical scheme, teachers are back to the bad old days of holding fundraising events to offset medical and funeral expenses,” said the Kuppet boss.
The union leader further emphasised that having access to medical care is a matter of human dignity. Without the means to afford medical attention, the Kuppet boss said, one's dignity is completely undermined.
“These teachers are pillars in their communities. Kuppet demands the immediate reinstatement of the scheme so that teachers can access the services due to them as a matter of right,” Mr Nthurima said
At the same time, Kuppet has expressed concerns about what he claimed was the reduction of the Kenya National Examinations Council (Knec) budget.
‘No national examinations’
""The council's budget has been cut to zero and the government has not allocated any money for the administration of national examinations. With only three months left before the examinations begin, this means there will be no national examinations this year unless parents agree to foot the costs,"" said Kuppet National Chairman Omboko Milemba.
Mr Milemba complained that, even after the government has made basic education free, parents have continued to pay examination fees.
“We must safeguard the integrity of national examinations, which will be administered in the next three months,” said Mr Milemba, who is also the Emuhaya member of Parliament.
Echoing Mr Nthurima’s sentiments on the medical insurance cover, Mr Milemba said many hospitals had complained of not receiving payments from TSC.
“We are requesting the Teachers' Service Commission to ensure that, when teachers go for treatment, the responsibility for their medical bills is taken over by the commission. The commission must act as a surrogate parent for the teachers. Therefore, we urge them to allocate the promised funds so that the scheme can be fully supported,” Mr Milemba said.",2024-07-11
https://nation.africa/kenya/news/justice-david-majanja-dies-in-nairobi-4686324,"High Court judge David Majanja is dead. Chief Justice Martha Koome confirmed the sudden death on Wednesday, July 10, saying the Judiciary fraternity is heartbroken.
""We are all heartbroken,"" Justice Koome said.
She said Judge Majanja will be remembered as a towering figure in the development of our transformative post-2010 jurisprudence and a crucial pillar in the institution-building of the JSC and the Judiciary.
The judge was recently re-elected as a member of the Judicial Service Commission (JSC), representing the Kenya Magistrates and Judges Association. He died at The Nairobi Hospital on Wednesday, July 10, where he was receiving treatment.
Justice Majanja, who is stationed at the High Court civil division at Milimani was re-elected on May 25 to the JSC for a second term.
He was appointed as a Judge of the High Court in 2011 and had previously served in Kisumu among other court stations.
Before his re-election at the JSC, Justice Majanja served as the chairperson of the human resource management committee, and a member of the Audit, Governance & Risk Management Committee and Learning & Development committee.
He holds a Master of Laws (LLM) degree from the University of Pretoria and a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Nairobi.
He was a member of the bench that found the Housing Levy, which was contained in the Finance Act, of 2023 discriminatory and unconstitutional.
Senior counsel Kiragu Kimani described Justice Majanja's passing as tragic. He described Justice Majanja as the perfect gentleman and a fine human being to boot.
""Easily one of the best judges we have ever had. His work ethic was second to none and I doubt that anyone can match his track record in terms of quantity and quality of decisions,"" Mr Kimani said.
Law Society of Kenya (LSK) president Faith Odhiambo said the legal fraternity had lost one of the fine minds on the bench.
""His studious contributions to our country's Jurisprudence and commitment to uphold standards of excellence in Judicial service formed a remarkable legacy for which he will be fondly remembered and greatly missed,"" Ms Odhiambo said in her X post.

CNN will merge its news-gathering and digital news teams, invest in video operations and launch pay-per-view news products, CNN Worldwide CEO Mark Thompson told staff in the memo.
""We are building a billion dollar+ digital business of the future,"" he said in the memo.
Thompson, a former New York Times, and BBC executive who took over as CNN's CEO in October last year, is trying to streamline the network's operations and grow sales to counter falling TV viewership.
CNN will launch a standalone subscription product for CNN.com by the end of this year, the first in a series of planned subscription offerings, including one that will focus on lifestyle and feature content.
The outlet will create TV Future Lab, a unit to produce content for the Max streaming platform and package CNN's TV content for its digital channels. CNN, which is owned by Warner Bros Discovery, started streaming content on Max last year.
Thompson also detailed several changes to CNN's editorial workflows, including a centralized planning and pitching process and a new ""story manager"" role to run all aspects of a story from beginning to publication or airing.

The voice that so unmistakably commanded the airwaves through her songs is still there, but the troubles she is facing steal its piercing decibels. She hesitates at times, not sure whether she is pursuing the right train of thought.
The past 14 years have been a trying period for the mellow-voiced singer, which is why she has not released an album since she released her third in 2010. But she pushes out an occasional single once in a while.
She has watched a number of her siblings ail and die, one after another. She comes from a family of five girls and six boys. She is the 10th born, and all her four sisters are now dead. Over the years, she has had to contend with the demise of her siblings, some of whom she nursed to the final minute.
And currently, her husband of 42 years, Francis Thiong’o, is under intensive care at the private wing of the Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH).
He has been bedridden since early June, when he took himself to a private hospital in Nairobi for a minor operation that was supposed to last only a few hours but went awfully wrong.
Now, she is the quintessential loving wife, pulling all stops to find money for his treatment (they need at least Sh4.5 million currently, and the bill keeps growing) and to provide everything that is needed to nurse him back to health.
Debt of Sh1.2 million
The family had to part with their car logbooks, two, hers and her son's, to secure her husband’s discharge from a private facility (with a debt of Sh1.2 million on the books) before Mr Thiong'o was transferred to KNH.
“The surgery was meant to be done on a Saturday (June 6) and then he would be observed overnight and released that Sunday. But that was not to happen,” says Jemmimah. “He walked into that hospital, but by the time we were asking them to have him transferred to KNH, he was immobile, being fed through a pipe, and could not talk.”
Her husband had chosen that date because he wanted to be fit as a fiddle when he attended the first birthday of one of his grandsons.
“For the 13th, we had plans. We had invited friends,” says Jemmimah.
However, that birthday was foregone, as the agenda abruptly turned into visiting the 66-year-old in hospital. On Jemmimah’s request, Lifestyle will not publish finer details of Mr Thiong’o’s illness due to ongoing medical processes.
One sure thing, though, is that Jemmimah sticks to God. She cites scriptures and preaches about God at every opportunity during our interview. “Do you question God?” we ask her.
She says no.
“I’ve gone through many things. Many things. And in all that, I have learned to trust in Jesus; trust in God in everything,” she says. “But when you call on God, he helps. And then I thank God that I’m surrounded by good people who are in fellowship and the church, and they have stood with me. They have walked with me, and that is where I get my strength from. And then also, the word of God comforts a lot. Psalms 23 says it very well: Even though I pass through the valley of the shadow of death, His rod and his staff are still with me; so He shall comfort me. And He has comforted me.”
“Akisema utapona, hakuna atakayezuia, mama aliyetokwa na damu aliponywa na kazi yake (If He says you will recover, no one will block that as the woman who was bleeding was cured through his work),” says part of Mwenye Baraka, the song that made her a household name in the early 2000s.
Obvious gift
In the true spirit of that message, she is waiting on God to cure her husband, and she exudes confidence that he will be back to his radiant self one day and that they can even write a book about the experience.
Jemmimah became a celebrity at 40, though she had been singing from a very young age.
“I wrote my first song when I was in Class Five, which I gave to one of the churches, and we were singing it in the choir. I sang in the church for many years until I was 40,” she says, noting that she inherited the music gene from her father.
“My father would sing everywhere. He had a really good voice and I was wondering why he was not singing. The rest of my sisters were members of different choirs, but they never recorded. And right now, my son and my daughter sing. My daughter is a worship leader in one of the churches – Citam Thika Road. My son is an instrumentalist,” says Jemmimah.
She could have recorded songs earlier, but she remembers being told by producers that the market for Kiswahili songs did not bring the best returns. However, because of the obvious gift she had, she was encouraged by her church to go into recording.
Anglican clerics, among them the late Archbishop Manasses Kuria and Bishop Peter Njenga, also gave her encouragement, and another member of her church took her to River, where she met R Kay, the music producer, and artistes Mary Githinji and Sarah Kiarie. This was in 2002. She recorded her songs, and the album was released in 2003.
In her opinion, the song Alinitua would be the most powerful on the album. It is because she wrote it after recovering from a slipped disc: “and then God healed me miraculously.”.
However, as it quickly turned out, Mwenye Baraka became a darling of the masses.
“That’s the song that, now I can say, many people resonated with. Reason? I can’t tell,” says Jemmimah, who considers Alinitua her favourite song.
So far, she has recorded “almost 50-something songs,"" which are in three albums, while others were released in the form of singles.
“I recorded the last album in 2010,” she says. “In between, I have released singles.”
This year, she planned to release live renditions of some of her songs, but that project is now on ice.
“I had to stop,” she says, adding that her husband’s illness forced her to drop everything.
Having ruled the airwaves with her songs, we ask her whether music pays.
“Music can pay, but music has a lot of loopholes,” she says. “I am yet to meet a musician who does not have a side hustle—something that you’re doing to boost your ministry; because it’s ministry.”
“We would be lying if we say that we did not have a time when we earned from music; we had. But we really had to work very hard. You are always on your toes, going to do crusades and other things,” she adds.
She has witnessed the industry fast-forward from tape cassettes to compact discs to digital versatile discs to USB devices and now streaming services and on-demand video platforms. From cassettes to YouTube, it has been a steep learning curve for her.
“Sometimes I think for most of us it (technological advancement) was like a setback because we had to learn how to do these things for ourselves,” says Jemmimah.
Asked about the younger gospel artistes, she believes they are doing well enough.
“They’re doing well. It’s good to accept when people do well. The younger people are doing well. We have people like Eunice Njeri, Evelyn Wanjiru, many sing now. You know, we are diverse,” she says. “They brought music to another level from what we were doing.”
Jemmimah’s inspirations for writing songs come from the Bible and sometimes sermons. Sometimes it is pure inspiration.
“You just wake up one morning and you start writing, and you don’t even know why you’re writing, and it becomes a song,” she says.
In the same vein, she has a problem with gospel artistes who do not go to church.
“They don’t want to be in church, but they want to sing gospel. They don’t want to be in fellowships, but they want to sing gospel. Gospel is a result of what you learn from the word of God, and what you learn,” says the musician.
As she ages in the music industry, justifying every day why she deserves to be in the local gospel industry’s hall of fame, she also has to reflect on the family tribulations she has faced. She lost one of her sisters, Grace, in 2010 after nursing her for a while. Grace had a heart problem.
“After a long illness, she died after surgery,” says Jemmimah. “I was really crying because I could not understand why. That was 2010, and that’s when I stopped singing.”
She lost a brother in 2011, a sister in 2012, another sister in 2018, then another brother in 2021.
“I won’t lie, there are times that you lock yourself in the bedroom and you feel as though you want to scream; you don’t know what to say. But I think God prepared me painfully. Painfully, yeah, and that same God is the one who’s giving me this grace to move on,” says Jemmimah.
Her husband can now talk again, though not clearly.
“He is getting better, and we thank God,” says Jemmimah.

https://nation.africa/kenya/blogs-opinion/editorials/protect-workers-abroad-4686586,"The suffering of Kenyan workers in the Middle East has been flagged numerous times following deaths or serious injuries inflicted by employers, their kin or agents.
It is a pity that the search for greener pastures ends so tragically or causes so much agony and torment.
Many families are mourning the deaths of their kin in unclear circumstances. And for some, the suffering is intensified by the long wait for the bodies to be flown back home.
Many Kenyans, most of them domestic workers, leave the country with irresistible promises by recruitment agencies only to end up in hell on earth. Once in the Middle East, they are abandoned by the recruitment agencies and hardly get any help from the Kenyan missions in their host countries.
Torture and humiliation are the daily experiences of many of those still overseas. They often recount harrowing stories of being overworked and mistreated.
Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi has confirmed that at least 316 Kenyans have lost their lives in the Gulf in the last two years. Saudi Arabia accounts for the highest number of the deaths of Kenyan immigrants in any of the Middle East countries with 166 workers.
With President William Ruto personally encouraging Kenyans to seek jobs overseas, the Middle East is a popular destination already accommodating 416,548 immigrants. According to Mr Mudavadi, the number could be higher as some do not register with the country’s missions in their host nations.
The assurance that although the recruitment for jobs overseas is a largely private sector affair, the government will not condone unethical enlisting of Kenyans by some agencies is welcome. The government has an obligation to protect its citizens at home and wherever they may be living or working abroad. It must liaise with its Saudi counterpart to ensure the protection and safety of the suffering Kenyan workers.",2024-07-10
https://nation.africa/kenya/counties/west-pokot/sleepy-aramaget-west-pokot-first-town--4686682,"Aramaget slum sits on 10 acres of land next to Kapenguria prisons, two kilometres from West Pokot County headquarters.
For locals, this shanty town in Kapenguria Sub-county holds fond memories of what was once West Pokot's first cherished 'town'.
Its existence dates back to the 1920s as the region's first trading centre, when people flocked there for all sorts of activities.
The historic shanty town, dotted with dilapidated mud-walled structures, once drove the local economy in a vibrant atmosphere created by exuberant traders.
Today, however, Aramaget lies silent, abandoned and dilapidated.
Now, signs of poverty and dilapidated buildings under the cover of rusted, torn iron sheets welcome you to the town.
The buildings that were once shops stand in rows, a sign of the lost prosperity.
Its dirty streets are punctuated by a destroyed tarmac road.
Over the years, sleepy Aramaget has become a hub for criminals and alcohol dens. The once vibrant shops are now cheap apartments.
For the locals, Aramaget is an ironic story, a sad reminder that modernisation does not always bring development.
Even with the new Kapenguria prisons nearby and new buildings such as the Early Childhood Education Centre built by the county government, it has failed to revive its fortunes.
Nation.Africa was able to track down some elders and residents who are familiar with the history of Aramaget.
They recalled that shops and clubs began to close as people gradually disappeared from the streets.
According to Pokot elders, Aramaget's reputation surpassed that of the present-day townships of Makutano and Kapenguria. It had been boosted by the establishment of the district headquarters in Kapenguria, they revealed.
The first person at the trading centre was an old man called Arap Maket from the Sengwer community of the Talai clan, who had seven wives and owned the first club called Kukui Maket, Pokot Council of Elders chairperson John Muok told Nation.Africa.
Muok, a former paramount chief, said Indians and Arabs used to sell goods at the market.
An Arab, Mohammed Calib, whose family is still in Kapenguria, set up the first posho mill in the centre in 1947, he said.
Calib owned a Chevrolet car, he recalled.
Among the Indians who came to Aramaget was Hugh Patel, who set up a branch of his Kitale town business at the centre in 1949.
“Patel had a lorry that used to transport people to and from Aramaget. Other Indians like Makalila and Parsodo also arrived,” recalled Muok.
Muok, who was a student at Kapenguria Government School (GS) in 1946, said there was a Busaa liquor club in the centre that attracted many people.
“We used to go and make houses at Aramaget using mud during holidays,” he said.
According to the elder, the old market town began to face competition from shopping centres that sprang up along the highway such as Makutano.
Christopher Lonyala, the former mayor of Kapenguria, said people from West Pokot County used to relax at Aramaget because of the Kapenguria Six – Kenya's founding fathers Mzee Jomo Kenyatta, Kungu Karumba, Fred Kubai, Paul Ngei, Bildad Kaggia and Ramogi Achieng Oneko – who were arrested on October 20, 1952 after the then Kenya Colony Governor, Sir Evelyn Baring, declared a state of emergency. The six were imprisoned there.
“We had three Indians and four white people at Aramaget. A judge at the African court in the area, Jackson Marua, with other government officers used to shop at the centre. Those people who used to build Kapenguria and the District Commissioner's office in 1952 used to stay in Aramaget,” he told Nation.Africa.
Lonyala said that another old man, Krop Cheruiyot, opened shops in Aramaget in 1952.
“Cheruiyot was the first councillor for Siyoi ward in 1964. He teamed up with his business partner Michael Kamarkech,” he narrated.
The elder added that the district commissioner and other government officials used to spend their free time in Aramaget.
“The trading centre had three shops and a hotel,” he said.
Later, the town became the main stage for buses such as Mawingo buses and Subira vehicles.
Another elder, Harrison Loyatum, said the town was affected during the 1992 clashes.
“Many Kikuyus who had set up businesses in the town were evicted and the businesses collapsed,” he said.
Loyatum said that after Kapenguria Hospital was established, the town moved to the Bendera area.
“There is also no space for development, and the non-operational ECDE teachers college could have helped Aramaget town to grow. Elders like Tomena, who was the chief of Mnagei, Kibutusi, Kamarkec, John Kaguo, and Kanyongi in the early 30s made the town to thrive,” he said.
One resident, Ochuoda Owino, said Aramaget can still grow if the government revamps it as a historical town.
“Those who were here between 1920 and 1930 will be surprised if they come back. Those who remained were unable to revive it, and everything collapsed. We need the town to be developed,” he said.
Residents attribute the death of the town to increased crime and the presence of illegal brews.
“It is hard to believe that on any ordinary day years back, this was an atmosphere of wild shouting from traders, bargaining buyers, and residents going about their business, which made Aramaget one of the busiest shopping centres in the larger West Pokot,” said Charles Krop, a resident.
He said Aramaget was littered with ghost shopping centres that were once beacons of a thriving economy and prospects. “Most of the traders who used to run shops in these centres have since moved on,” he added.
Irene Chebet, who owns the last remaining shop, said a spate of robberies had driven the last traders out of town. She cuts a lonely figure in her shop.
“Before I opened my shop in 2020, this centre was deserted,” Chebet said.
“It takes me three days to sell 10 loaves of bread and I often have to spend cold nights inside the shop to keep thieves away. Most of my customers are prison warders.”
There is hope for Aramaget's revival and West Pokot Governor Simon Kachapin has said he has an ambitious plan to make it happen.
""We will soon issue title deeds to the people so that they can start developing the town. We need vehicles to come to Aramaget and people to start new businesses,"" he said.",2024-07-11

https://nation.africa/kenya/counties/nakuru/teenager-killed-in-alleged-drunk-driving-on-way-to-school-4686836,"A family in Store Mbili village in Njoro, Nakuru County, is in mourning after their 13-year-old daughter died in a road accident allegedly caused by drunk driving on her way to school.
The incident happened early Tuesday, July 9, when Margaret, a Grade Five pupil at Mutirima Primary School, was walking to school with her younger sister.
They were hit by a vehicle reportedly driven by a 21-year-old man accompanied by two youths who were allegedly under the influence of alcohol after a night of partying in Njoro town.
In an interview, Margaret's mother, Beth Nyambura, told Nation.Africa she woke her children at 5 am and got them ready for school.
Within minutes of leaving home at around 6:30am, her younger daughter returned in distress with the devastating news that her older sister, Margaret, had been fatally injured in the accident.
""Wambui, a hardworking and disciplined girl, left home that morning full of life and it is devastating that her promising future was abruptly ended by a reckless driver under the influence of alcohol. I was shocked when she came crying and said her sister was dead. She told me what had happened, but at first I could not believe it. Her father then rushed to the scene and confirmed the worst, that she had been run over by the car,"" said the grieving mother.
Ms Nyambura said her younger daughter sustained injuries to her hands and legs in the accident.
A neighbour, Peter Ngugi, who witnessed the accident, said he heard a loud bang and when he rushed to the scene he found the vehicle which had veered off the road after hitting the two sisters.
They were trying to speed away but they veered off the road and hit the girls,"" Mr Ngugi said.
""I went to check on the occupants of the overturned vehicle and found two young men and a woman. One of the men had escaped. The driver and the woman were drunk. The driver confessed that they had been drinking at a club in the Egerton area and returned the vehicle to its owner. We just want action to be taken against them,"" Mr Ngugi said.
He said the deceased died of her injuries on the way to a nearby hospital for treatment.
A crowd quickly gathered at the scene and managed to arrest the three occupants of the vehicle, who confessed that they were returning from a night of drinking at a club near Egerton.
Police quickly arrived to diffuse the tense situation and took the suspects into custody.
Njoro Sub-County Police Commander Paul Wambugu said the driver had been identified as Sammy Kirubi, adding that they had launched a manhunt for the suspect, who fled the scene.
""We are investigating the fatal accident, including allegations of drunk driving. The body of the deceased has been taken to Egerton Funeral Home and the vehicle has been impounded at Njoro Police Station,"" Mr Wambugu said.

https://nation.africa/kenya/news/gender/three-world-records-in-two-months-the-journey-of-unstoppable-faith-kipyegon--4685660,"What you need to know:
- Faith Kipyegon has broken multiple world records and is aiming for her third consecutive Olympic gold at the 2024 Paris Olympics.
- She has overcome challenges, including taking a break to start a family, and has become one of the most successful middle-distance runners in history.
- Her humble beginnings and dedication to her sport have made her an inspiration to many.
Faith Kipyegon has broken her own 1,500m world record just weeks ahead of the 2024 Paris Olympics – where she has set her sights on her third consecutive gold over the distance. No athlete in history has won three Olympic 1,500m titles and it would make 2024 a huge year for the Kenyan star, who also competes in the 5,000m event.
Faith was in the headlines throughout 2023 - and particularly at the 2023 in Budapest, Hungary. That’s because she broke three world records in less than two months on her way to Hungary, where she lifted gold in the 1,500m for the third year in a row – as well as winning the 5,000m event. She became the first woman in history to win gold over both distances at the championships.
While Ethiopia, Uganda and Kenya continue to spearhead Africa’s hopes for medals in middle and distance running events, over time athletes from the continent are earning fewer gold medals at major events, even Kenya’s famous male distance athletes.
Faith, however, has bucked the trend. Considered by many as the greatest female 1,500m runner in history, she is the one athlete who has been consistent for the last eight years.
As a sport scientist with a research focus on Kenyan athletics, I have followed Faith’s career with interest. But who is she, what drives her and how did she manage to achieve this level of success despite taking a break from competing to start a family?
World record spree
Of the last six World Athletics Championships or Olympics dating back to 2016, the 29-year-old Faith has only missed out on 1,500m gold once. That was in 2019 when the championships took place 15 months after she gave birth to her daughter.
She has comfortably won Olympic gold medals in 2016 and 2021 as well as her multiple world championship titles. She broke the 1,500m world record in June 2023 and just a week later stunned the stadium – and herself – by smashing the 5,000m world record. It was only her third race over the distance. Her season has simply been outstanding – also breaking the world record for the mile.
The 2023 World Athletics Championships cemented her legacy and single season success – which compares to other historic feats such as US stars Usain Bolt’s 2009 and Florence Griffith-Joyner’s 1988 performances.
Who is Faith Kipyegon?
The eighth of nine children, Faith grew up on a farm in Ndabibit, a village in the Rift Valley region of Kenya. Like many kids educated in rural areas, she walked and jogged many miles to and from school. Little did she know that this would instil the fundamental locomotion and physical skills that would form the foundation of her athletics career. This walking is enhanced by the physical education and sports activities that children engage in while in school.
By 14, Faith had tried her hand at football when, during a physical education class, she took part in her first 1km race. She finished far ahead of everyone else in class.
In the words of Faith, winning that race created an awareness that she could “run fast and be a good athlete”. Just two years later, she came fourth in the World Cross Country Championships under-19 event.
At 16 she was the youngest finisher in the cross country top 21. Running barefoot, she started her winning trend at a cross country event the following year and achieved 1,500m Olympic gold in 2016.
After world 1,500m titles in 2016 and 2017, Faith took a break to give birth to her daughter, Alyn. She faced the conflict of many women athletes, between family and career.
“I was so afraid, maybe I will not come back, I will just disappear,” she said. “I thought it was the end of my career, but it was the beginning.”
It took great mental strength to take a year off and gradually rebuild her stamina, strength and speed. In a vibrant comeback, she seems stronger than ever. Winning gold at the Tokyo Olympics and last year’s world championships made her the first woman to claim four global outdoor titles in the 1,500m, thus the greatest female mile runner ever.
Faith spends five days a week training, separated from Alyn and her husband Timothy Kitum, the 2012 Olympic 800m bronze medallist, who serves in the army in Kenya. For all three of her world records, she wore a bracelet adorned with her daughter’s name and the colours of the Kenyan flag. Alyn wears a matching bracelet while doing schoolwork back home.
Her successes on the track have brought riches to her and her family. The Kenyan government has rewarded her excellent performances with cash and a house.
During a recent speech she broke into tears, saying: Now I can buy my father a car. I promised him when I was going to break a world record that I’m going to buy a car for him. So now I can fulfil my promise.
Faith’s humble background meant that her parents couldn’t watch her win gold at the 2016 Olympic Games because they didn’t even have electricity in their rural home. It is inspirational to see what her vision, focus and application have yielded over time. Her training environment at Kaptagat in Kenya, also reveals her humility. She’s part of a group of 30 or so athletes who largely live together and share chores, along with marathon world record holder Eliud Kipchoge.
Faith’s story is worth telling. She stands as an inspiration to countless girls back home and, indeed, a continent.

https://nation.africa/kenya/business/kenya-s-domestic-debt-up-by-sh577bn-in-a-year-4686226,"The government’s local debt expanded by 5.8 per cent during the fiscal year that ended last month, with new borrowings hitting Sh577 billion up from Sh545.2 billion acquired in a similar period the previous year.
According to fresh data from the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), the additional loans took the country’s domestic debt stock to Sh5.41 trillion as at the end of June 2024, up from Sh4.832 trillion at the end of June last year.
The National Treasury had set the domestic borrowing target at Sh851.8 billion as of May, including Sh471.3 billion in net local borrowing and Sh380.5 billion in payments or redemptions. The projection on new domestic borrowing has, however, been a moving target with the National Treasury having first revised the net domestic borrowing targets to Sh415.3 billion down from the original Sh587.4 billion projections in its September Budget Review and Outlook Paper (BROP).
The second 2023/24 supplementary estimates meanwhile set the target for net domestic borrowing further down to Sh407.0 billion.
The government was at the time seeking to implement an elaborate scheme to slash fresh debt by Sh273.7 billion.
CBK, which is the government’s fiscal agent, had said that reduced borrowing in the domestic market would help cool pressures on interest rates.
The cut in local borrowing was further expected to help raise dollar inflows and slow down weakening of the shilling due to a gaping mismatch between supply and demand for the international reserve currency.
Domestic borrowing
In December, Treasury again reviewed the domestic borrowing target to Sh471.4 billion on the back of lower-than-projected tax collections.
The heightened borrowing came despite the implementation of new and aggressive taxation measures contained in the Finance Act, 2023 which sought to narrow the country’s fiscal deficit during President Ruto’s first full financial year in office.
In the full year ended June, the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) collected Sh2.22 trillion in ordinary revenue marking a 9.5 per cent jump from the Sh2.03 trillion netted in the fiscal year ended June 2023.
Despite the growth in both tax collections and net borrowings, the taxman missed its target by Sh267 billion on the back of reduced corporate profits and job cuts in a period when businesses were held down by the depreciation of the local currency as well as high energy prices.
Analysts have blamed the International Monetary Fund for setting unrealistic tax targets for Kenya as part of its ongoing budgetary support programme.
Among the taxation shifts that the Dr Ruto-led regime oversaw during its first full fiscal year in office included enforcing the 16 percent value-added tax on fuel.",2024-07-10
https://nation.africa/kenya/business/lsk-resignation-ktda-director-sexual-exploitation-allegations--4686876,"The Law Society of Kenya has waded into the controversy surrounding the election of John Chebochok as Kenya Development Authority (KTDA) zonal director over accusations of sexual exploitation of workers.
Mr Chebochok’s election on June 29, 2024, as a director of Tegat/Toror tea factory in Ainamoi, Kericho county has kicked up a storm in the tea sector in what has led to a boycott of the produce from international buyers in protest.
In a statement, LSK called for the immediate resignation of Mr Chebochok and demanded that KTDA “implements robust policies and mechanisms to ensure the safety and protection of all workers from sexual harassment and exploitation.
LSK President Faith Odhiambo called for the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) to review its vetting procedures to conform with the express provision of Chapter 6 of the Constitution to prevent individuals with questionable characters from contesting for leadership positions in the future.
“KTDA and other stakeholders must be transparent about the steps being taken to address these concerns and must hold accountable those who fail to uphold ethical standards,” Ms Odhiambo said.
The LSK is also calling on stakeholders to take decisive action to rectify the situation to ensure all ethical standards are upheld.
LSK demands come even as more than 4,200 people signed an online petition seeking to have Chebochok removed.
Under the lobby group Nguvu Change Leaders, the petitioners said Mr Chebochok has no moral authority to lead the small-scale tea growers as a KTDA representative despite having been elected in a process that has been challenged.
It comes ahead of a Special General Meeting scheduled by shareholders on July 18, 2024, that will decide the fate of the embattled newly elected director.
The Nguvu Change Leaders is also demanding that the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) subject all the documents presented by Mr Chebochok to the IEBC for clearance into scrutiny as a matter of urgency.
“The election of Mr Chebochok undermines the efforts by the government and other stakeholders to fight gender-based violence in the country. It is a matter we should all deal with as a society” Ms Nelly Andeso, who is leading the petition, said in a statement.
The lobby group is calling for concerted efforts to ensure that women in the tea industry are protected from sex pests.
“Chebochok’s actions are not only a violation of human rights but also undermines the moral fabric of the society as it has a negative effect on the mental health of the victims and the economy of the country” Ms Andeso said
Liptons Teas and Infusions and James Finlays have announced the suspension of trade deals with the factory while demanding that Mr Chebochok be removed from the position.
It stems from the past record of the newly elected director where he was captured in a BBC documentary aired on February 20, 2023, seeking sexual favours from workers and job seekers at multinational tea companies in return for promotions, allocation of light duties, salary increase and employment.
Mr Chebochok who was a contractor at James Finlays Kenya had the services offered by his company terminated as a result while the managers and supervisors who were captured in the secretive video recording were suspended.
James Finlays Kenya and Ekaterra Plc which were affected have since taken corrective measures to curb a recurrence of the cases that shocked the tea industry.
Six Non-Governmental Organisations under the Coalition of Organisations Working on Sexual Violence in Kenya have moved to court seeking to block the confirmation of Mr Chebochok as a director.
The newly elected directors who are set for confirmation by shareholders of the factor are; John Chebochock (Ainamoi), Kemboi Geoffrey Kipkirui (Kapsaos zone), Philiph Kipkoech (Mosop zone), Japeth Chepkwony ( Kapsuser zone), Chepkirui Korir (Sosiot zone) and Evans Kiplangat (Waldai zone).
Already, the factory board members led by Mr Japeth Chepkwony have since asked Mr Chebochok to step down so as to save farmers from loss of business.
Usikimye Community Based Organization, Wangu Kanja Foundation (K) Registered Trustees, Centre for Rights Education and Awareness (CREAW) Oxfam, The African Gender and Media Initiative Trust (GEM) Registered Trustees and Flone Initiative – are the organizations that have moved to court.
Mr John Chebochok, Tegat Tea Factory Limited, Kenya Tea Development Agency, Tea Board of Kenya (KTDA), Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) have been named in the petition as the respondents.
The Law Society of Kenya (LSK), Utu Wetu Trust, Association of Grassroots Journalists Kenya, Advocates for Social Change –Kenya, Independent Medico-Legal Unit, KATIBA Institute, National Gender and Equality Commission and Kenya National Commission on Human Rights have been listed as interested parties in the petition.
“This gross misconduct not only tarnishes the reputation of the tea industry but also inflicts severe harm on the victims, whose wounds remain unhealed, and their cries for justice need to be heard and redressed,” Ms Chepkoech (advocate) states in court documents.
The petitioners stated that on June 19, 2024, the Coalition Against Sexual Violence (CASV) wrote to KTDA and IEBC over the clearance of the candidate.
Mr Willy Mutai, the Tea Board of Kenya Chief Executive Officer had on June 24, 2024, written to IEBC CEO Hussein Marjan highlighting the potential negative repercussions on the global market for Kenyan tea.
The IEBC has sought to absolve itself from blame saying Mr Chebochok presented all required documents as laid down in the election manual before being cleared to contest, including a police clearance certificate.
“The checklist provided that a valid certificate of good conduct issued by the National Service’ Department of Criminal Investigations would suffice as proof of good standing of a candidate,” Mr Marjan said in a statement.",2024-07-11
https://nation.africa/kenya/sports/athletics/lawrence-cherono-gets-seven-year-ban-for-doping-violation-4686674,"Kenyan Lawrence Cherono has been handed a seven-year ban after the former Boston and Chicago marathon winner was found to have violated anti-doping regulations, the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) said on Wednesday.
The AIU imposed a ban of four years for the violation together with another four-year ban for the tampering or attempted tampering of the doping control, but reduced the overall ban by one year due to admission and acceptance.
Cherono, 35, had been provisionally suspended in July 2022 after testing positive for trimetazidine in an out-of-competition sample, and the AIU determined that the athlete did not have an exemption for the banned substance.
The Kenyan told the AIU that he had been experiencing stomach problems and said a doctor had injected him with an unknown substance, but later gave a different explanation, blaming a mix-up with his wife's medication.
The seven-year ban starts from July 16, 2022, the date of the original provisional suspension.",2024-07-11
https://nation.africa/kenya/news/gender/my-husband-wants-me-out-the-traditional-same-sex-union-that-ended-in-shocking-property-dispute-4686020,"What you need to know:
- A court case involving a woman-to-woman marriage in Machakos County has exposed the vulnerabilities faced by women in traditional 'iweto' unions.
- Josephine Ndulu, who believed she was securely married to Angela Nyamai under Kamba customary law, now faces eviction from her home after a court ruled she had no rights to the property she shared with her 'wife'.
In the heart of Machakos County, a tale of love, tradition, and betrayal unfolds, challenging the very foundations of a unique marital custom.
Josephine Ndulu's world has been turned upside down, her dreams of a secure future shattered by a court ruling that has left her distraught and facing ridicule in her community.
""They're mocking me,"" Josephine tells nation.africa, her voice trembling with emotion.
""They say they're hatching a plan to kick me out of this homestead using a court order.""
Her pain is palpable, a stark contrast to the relief felt by Angela Nyamai and her daughter Nthikwa Murimi, who sighed with relief as the five-year legal battle came to a close.
At the heart of this complex drama lies the practice of iweto marriage, a woman-to-woman union sanctioned by Kamba customary law. It's a tradition that has long provided a solution for widows, barren women, or those without sons, allowing them to secure their family lineage and social standing.
For years, Josephine believed she had found security in her marriage to Angela. As a peasant farmer, she had devoted herself to their shared life, tending to leased parcels of land in the neighbourhood. The union seemed to offer the prestige of marriage and the promise of a stable future.
But the idyllic facade crumbled in 2015 when Josephine discovered that Angela had been secretly selling parcels of their family land in Kasolongo Village. Feeling betrayed and fearing for her future, Josephine sought answers, only to find herself facing a plan to evict her from the very home she thought was hers.
Angela, operating from a different parcel of land in Machakos, justified the land sales as necessary to cover hospital bills. She claimed the land was gifted to her by her late husband, Joseph Munyao Kilonzo, before his death in 2005, asserting her right to dispose of it as she pleased.
The legal battle that ensued has shed light on the complexities of iweto marriages.
While Angela attempted to divorce Josephine in 2016, the court directed her to follow Kamba customary law, highlighting the legal ambiguities surrounding such unions.
Josephine's quest for justice led her to file a case against Angela in 2019, seeking to nullify the land sales and secure her share of what she believed to be their joint property.
However, Machakos Principal Magistrate Hellen Mbati's ruling dealt a crushing blow to Josephine's hopes.
""The plaintiff only proved that she is an iweto,"" Magistrate Mbati stated in her ruling. ""She neither contributed to the suit property nor provided any evidence of making improvements thereon.""
The court's decision underscores the precarious position of women in iweto marriages, caught between tradition and modern legal frameworks.
Geoffrey Mutua, a Kamba clan elder who testified in the case, explained the intricacies of such marriages: ""To prevent a woman from being ostracised for being childless, Kamba custom allows her to woo a young woman. If the young woman accepts the marriage proposal, the old woman observes all the ceremonies which apply in a conventional marriage, such as paying bride price.""
The practice mirrors similar customs in other African communities, including the Igbo in Nigeria, the Nuer and Dinka in South Sudan, and even among the Nandi and Kikuyu in Kenya.
While it serves a social purpose, it also raises questions about the rights and status of the women involved.
Serah Ngila, a teacher who has extensively studied iweto marriages around Kangundo in Machakos County, notes that some women enter these unions motivated by the husband's wealth.
""Iweto marriage is one of the preferred options available for women without sons, though it contravenes Christian teaching,"" she explains in a paper dubbed ‘The persistence of Iweto Marriage among the Akamba Christians of Kangundo District Machakos County, Kenya’.

""The society has not come to terms with other solutions such as adoption of children.""
African literary icon David Maillu offers a different perspective, arguing that iweto is essentially an adoption to cure childlessness.
""The iweto marriage institution is as divine as the conventional marriage,"" he asserts. ""It is meant for serving a particular purpose; siring children to keep the family name alive. An iweto is entitled to the property of her husband just the way an adopted child enjoys full rights like any other child.""
Yet, as Josephine's case demonstrates, the reality can be far more complex and fraught with challenges. The court's ruling has exposed the vulnerabilities faced by women in such unions, particularly when it comes to property rights and inheritance.
Angela maintains that she is not married to Josephine, claiming that Josephine is merely a relative who came to stay with them and remained. She denies taking bride price to Josephine's parents, and refuses to discuss her 2016 attempt to divorce Josephine in a Machakos court.
This denial adds another layer of complexity to the case, highlighting the difficulties in legally recognising and protecting the rights of women in customary marriages that fall outside the scope of conventional marital laws.
The case has sparked debate about the place of such customary practices in contemporary society. As Kenya grapples with modernisation and changing social norms, traditions like iweto marriages find themselves under scrutiny, challenging both legal and social systems to adapt and provide equitable solutions.
For Josephine, the future remains uncertain. Forced to lease out parcels of land in the neighbourhood for farming, she faces the prospect of losing her home and the life she has built. Her story serves as a poignant reminder of the challenges faced by women navigating the intersection of tradition, law, and personal relationships.
As the community watches and whispers, Josephine and Angela stand on opposite sides of a divide that goes beyond personal conflict, touching on deeper issues of cultural practice, legal recognition, and the evolving nature of family in modern Kenya.
For now, Josephine's story remains unfinished, a testament to the complex interplay of love, tradition, and law in a rapidly changing society.",2024-07-11
https://nation.africa/kenya/news/where-are-they-tales-of-anti-ruto-protesters-arrested-by-police-not-to-be-seen-again-4686568,"Mukhtar Tache Ali, Nura Abdi Diba and Issa Osman had just broken bread with two other friends at a restaurant in Isiolo town on the dawn of July 6, and were about to part and go about their businesses.
As the group of five walked out of the restaurant looking to make the best out of the day, police officers lying in wait had different plans for them.
Two white Toyota Prados and white Subaru Outbacks were parked in different locations within Isiolo town.
Plain-clothes security agents cornered and violently picked them up, bundling them into the vehicles.
Two of them were thrown out of the car after a little questioning, before the vehicles sped onto the Isiolo-Nairobi highway. Those are the last known whereabouts of Mr Ali, Mr Diba and Mr Osman.
Mr Abdi Osman Guyo, elder brother of Mr Osman, said that the incident happened between 5am and 6am.
“The vehicles were parked in three different locations. They picked five of them but two were dropped in different parts as the vehicles sped towards Nairobi,” said Mr Guyo.
In a joint statement, the families demanded their immediate release after reporting their abductions at the Isiolo Police Station, which was recorded under Occurrence Book (OB) number 29/06/07/24.
They complain that the three detainees have been denied access to family, friends and legal counsel despite recent reassurances by President William Ruto that there will be no politically-motivated police excesses in his regime.
The three are among at least 18 individuals still being held by security agencies, reliable sources have informed Nation.
The number has not, however, been authoritatively confirmed as police bosses refrain from speaking on the record on their colleagues’ actions and tactics during and after the street protests that culminated in the invasion of Parliament Buildings.
A multi-agency team has been formed in a bid to investigate several individuals the government believes could have funded the anti-tax protests, though youths with huge online followings who have become the face of the protests say the protests are not funded by any political figures.
Investigations
On Tuesday, Interior CS Kithure Kindiki said that investigations into some individuals are nearly complete.
A senior police officer told the Nation that the multi-agency team is drawn from the police, Kenya Defence Forces and National Intelligence Service.
The team reportedly has representatives from commercial banks tasked with tracing financial flows for suspected financiers. The lenders are being coordinated by the Financial Reporting Centre, the officer added.
The team formed a week ago has been holding a series of meetings at the National Defense College in Karen to strategise on the investigations.
Sources familiar with the matter yesterday said that the decision to form this multi-agency team was reached at a meeting held at the office of the president last Saturday and attended by all senior security bosses.
The meeting, according to sources, was chaired by the Interior CS. Inspector General of Police Japhet Koome, his deputy Douglas Kanja, NIS boss Noordin Haji and other officials from the OP were present.
While no evidence has been traced to affirm its position, the NIS in a confidential brief stated that two politicians from Central region, three from Nairobi, one from Rift Valley, a businessman, and a local and International NGO are under focus for allegedly financing the anti-government protests.
State-instigated abductions have continued despite repeated denials by President William Ruto of such kidnappings in the past month, and a directive for immediate release of all those held incommunicado.
At least 39 people died in the anti-government protests, with 361 injuries, 627 arbitrary arrests and 32 abductions, the Kenya National Human Rights Commission – an independent government body – said last week.
President Ruto has since the start of the protests shifted goalposts, first insisting that there have been no abductions in his time as Head of State, then stating that those picked up by security agencies were formally arrested.
Last week, during an X Spaces engagement, President Ruto said that he would initiate investigations into alleged abductions, and ensure that formal arrests are done in accordance with the law.
Mr Guyo said that his brother’s abductors asked the two released men to step out of the car, one at a time, and lie down facing the ground.
“They told them not to raise their heads until they completely leave the place,” he said.
It is also emerging that Issa Osman is sickly and the family is fearing for his health. He had recently married and the wife was so shaken and worried whether the husband was safe, his family said.
Mr Guyo added that the three families have tried their best to search for the three in vain. He said that they had visited various police stations both in Nairobi and Isiolo but they have not found them.
Released unconditionally
“This is just wrong and all we want is that they are released unconditionally,” he said, adding that if they had committed any crimes then they should be arraigned in court and not being held incommunicado.
At the same time, Mr Yussuf Huka who is a community elder said that they suspect that the trio had been abducted due to the protests that have for the past three weeks taken place in various parts of the country.
In Nanyuki, Lewis Ngunyi presented himself to police officers on July 8 after learning that unknown people had been tracking him with an aim to abduct him.
He has been detained since then, with the DCI only filing a miscellaneous application in court on Wednesday to hold him for a further 14 days.
Lewis was eventually released on July 10, evening.
The body of Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT) student protestor, Denzel Omondi, was found in a dam in Juja after he went missing following suspected abduction by security agents.
In Nairobi, Mr Jackson Kuria Kihara, alias Shakurthecop who is a Police Constable attached to Kamiti Prisons, was arrested for protesting outside parliament.
Mr Kihara was arrested while yelling as he displayed a placard that read: “We want justice and not your deepest condolences.”
He was arrested by officers attached to Parliament Police Station.
“The officer in charge of Kamiti Medium Prison was contacted and he confirmed the officer works under his command and is currently facing disciplinary proceedings,” a report filed at Parliament Police Station under OB number 36/09/07/2024 read in part.
The report only revealed that he had been placed in custody for the offence of participating in an unlawful assembly but never revealed which station he was being held at.
The Nation contacted Ms Doris Kemey, who is the Nairobi Central Police Station boss, who said that she was not aware of Mr Kihara’s whereabouts.
However, an officer privy to the ongoing investigations hinted that the officer was being held at Central Police Station.
Mr Benjamin Njeru of MNW and Advocates who is his lawyer said that it was very difficult to know the whereabouts of the officer as no one was willing to reveal where he had been taken to.
“We have really struggled. On July 10, the police in Parliament Station sent us to Central Police Station and there we were not given information whether he was in the cells,” Mr Njeru said.
According to him, he spent the better part of Tuesday evening and night trying to locate him in vain.
However, on Wednesday, July 10, morning, he managed to find his client being held at Central Police Station and that he had been made aware that the police were planning to charge him for unlawful assembly.
“He was arrested for unlawful assembly which is ridiculous considering that he was demonstrating alone. To make it worse it is now over 24 hours and he has not been taken to court,” Mr Njeru said.
This is not the first time Mr Kihara has been arrested and gone missing before being found later.
Three weeks ago, images of the officer where he was captured carrying posters opposing the Finance Bill 2024, made rounds on various social media platforms.
At the time he was praised by many social media users but the joy could be cut short after it emerged that he was missing.
He went missing on June 26, and the family really suffered as they searched for him in vain and they remained with the option of pleading to the government to assist them to trace Mr Kihara.
Some of the posters that he shared on social media critiqued some of the suggestions that were part of the Finance Bill 2024. He shared the images while dressed in full police uniform.
One poster read; “Sanitary towels should be free. Unafikiria tax sana Zakayo. Power belongs to the people.”
Another one read; “Guns should not be used on peaceful protesters save them (bullets) for Haiti gangs.”
According to the National Police Service (NPS) standing orders, a police officer when using social media privately shall not, in their capacity as national police employees purport to make any official comment on social media about any incident, police policy or procedure without prior authorisation and in accordance with the media policy.
“The spokesperson appointed from the office of the Inspector General or respective Service Headquarters is responsible for representing the service externally on matters concerning communities, crimes, or policing Public comment as a private citizen,” the standing orders on the use of social media read.
The orders do give police officers the right to enter into public debates and comment on social, economic or any other issue, however, any comment shall be made strictly as a private citizen and be separate from, and avoid any reference to matters of employment with the NPS.
The orders also caution the police not to refer to their position or profession whenever they are expressing an opinion or participating in public debate in a private capacity.
“Any comments shall not be seen to represent the National Police Service, Administration Police Service, Kenya Police Service, Directorate of Criminal Investigations in part, or to compromise the officer’s ability to serve the government of the day in a politically neutral manner,” the orders state.
Obscene material
In case a police officer goes ahead and posts offensive, tribal, or obscene material on their personal social media site, the orders say that they shall be in breach of this order and shall be subject to a disciplinary procedure.
On Tuesday, the government said that it will ensure that it investigates and prosecutes all persons, including police officers, who are implicated in the abductions, enforced disappearances and arbitrary arrests of Kenyans during the anti-Finance Bill 2024 protests that rocked the country in the past 3 weeks.
Interior CS Kithure Kindiki said that all persons living in Kenya are protected from unlawful or arbitrary arrears, abductions and enforced disappearances.
""The Government reiterates its duty to respect and ensure the protection of all constitutionally guaranteed rights and will not condone any violation whether perpetuated by security personnel or by public or private persons,"" said Prof Kindiki.
In addition, he warned people who take advantage of peaceful protests to cause harm through vandalising and looting of property.
Ms Faith Odhiambo (LSK president) and Mr Hosea Manwa, a member of the LSK council, termed the abductions.
“As LSK we are saddened with the series of abductions taking place despite the President reassuring members of the public that this will not take place under his leadership,” Mr Manwa said.
Ms Odhiambo said that the abductions were unconstitutional and were persisting amid perpetual denial by the government.
“We would like to bring to the attention of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) Kenya and the general public the abduction of three young men in Isiolo. We note with concern that these unconstitutional abductions persist amidst perpetual denials by government officials in charge of security over their occurrences,” she said.
“We demand an immediate investigation into this complaint and prosecution of the criminals perpetrating abduction of citizens,” she added.",2024-07-11
https://nation.africa/kenya/news/politics/kalonzo-s-new-demands-that-could-derail-the-remaining-eight-nadco-bills-4686556,"Wiper Democratic Movement party leader Kalonzo Musyoka has said he is not interested in joining hands with the Kenya Kwanza government as he does not want to be associated with President William Ruto’s administration.
The former Vice-President dismissed talks that opposition outfit Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Coalition Party is warming up to the idea of a government of national unity. Speaking during the Wiper National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting at the party’s headquarters in Nairobi yesterday, Mr Musyoka said the coalition will soon convene and make it categorical to its leader, former Prime Minister Raila Odinga, that Kenyans do not want to be associated with the Ruto regime.
“We will tell him that Kenyans do not want dialogue. We do not want to be seen to be sanitising a regime that has failed,” he said.
President Ruto had on Tuesday announced plans for “a broad-based political arrangement”, which pundits took to mean a government of national unity.
Peaceful protesters
On Wednesday, July 10, Mr Musyoka also took a swipe at the National Police Service for using excessive force against peaceful protesters.
He urged the rank and file of the police service not to be used by their commanders to kill, injure and maim young protesters.
“We cannot be abducting, killing and destroying the lives of our future leaders,” Mr Musyoka said in reference to the recent abduction of Mr Joshua Okayo, the President of the Kenya School of Law. The Wiper party further accused the Kenya Kwanza regime of stalling the full implementation of the National Dialogue Committee (Nadco) report.
Wiper Secretary-General Shakila Abdalla lauded President Ruto for assenting to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (Amendment) Bill, 2024, but called for the enactment of the remaining Bills in order to give life to the Nadco report.
Ms Abdalla pointed out that, had President Ruto acted on several issues pressing Kenyans and fully implemented the Nadco report, the chaos and deaths that were witnessed over the past few weeks would have been avoided.
“As Wiper, we are extremely disappointed with the dragging of feet and lack of goodwill from the Kenya Kwanza regime. The present circumstances, however, afford all of us an opportunity to re-look at these pieces of legislation and ask the question: are they relevant at this time? Nonetheless, our party is committed to the full implementation of the Nadco report,” Ms Abdalla said.
Dialogue
The party also dismissed calls for dialogue to resolve issues affecting the country, saying, previous efforts have borne no fruit.
“You do not need dialogue ... to investigate public debt because the auditor-general’s office has the same role. The attempt to [subvert] the Constitution by forming a task force on the subject is equally telling. You do not need dialogue to post medical interns and sack corrupt government officials,” she said.
On Tuesday, Mr Musyoka said the remaining eight Bills contained in the Nadco report need to be reviewed to align them with the political realities.
Mr Musyoka also regretted that the cost of living, an agenda item pushed by the opposition but rejected by the government, is among the grievances that have been cited by the protesters.
“We undertook that process with gusto and an open mind as Azimio but [National Assembly Majority Leader] Kimani [Ichung’wah] and his Kenya Kwanza team convinced us that it was the government’s responsibility and the opposition had no part to play in the discussions about the high cost of living,” he said.
“I hope that in the light of recent development, my friend Kimani would have revised that thought because again Finance Act 2024 and the riots have lost young Kenyans,” he added.
Mr Ichung’wah, who co-chaired the talks, however, said on Tuesday that the remaining Bills will be given priority. The proposed legislation that emanated from the Nadco talks and that are yet to be considered include the Elections (Amendment) Bill, 2023, Elections Offenses (Amendment), Bill, 2023 and the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (Amendment) Bill, 2023.
Others are the Statutory Instruments (Amendments) Bill, 2023, Political Parties (Amendment) Bill, 2023 and the National Government Coordination (Amendment) Bill, 2023.",2024-07-11
https://nation.africa/kenya/counties/kisii/who-killed-my-son-braxton-kisii-widow-asks--4686932,"What you need to know:
- Mogesi recalled that her son's abductors claimed they were attacking the boys because they had been transported from Nairobi to take part in the July 2, 2024 protest in Kisii town.
- Omae's horrific abduction marked the beginning of a long, traumatic search — from police stations to hospital wards and even mortuaries.
At around 1am in the early hours of July 3, 2024, a loud bang followed by terrified cries and distress calls shattered the deafening silence in Jogoo Estate, Kisii County.
The desperate cries for help came from the home of a widow named Isabela Mogesi.
A group of unknown men, estimated to be in their 40s and heavily armed with all sorts of weapons, had broken into Mogesi's home.
They attacked her sons.
""I heard someone asking my children, 'Are you the ones who were brought from Nairobi to come and protest in Kisii?'""
The intruders had broken into the house next door where two of her sons were sleeping.
""I was too terrified to open the door and intercede for my children. However, from my hiding spot, I could see one of them lying prostrate on the verandah and surrounded by a group of vicious looking men,"" she narrated.
But while she was still trying to decide what to do next, her eldest son, Brian Philip, 31, who was sleeping in another house in the same compound, went out to question the attackers.
According to Mogesi, Philip pleaded with the men to show mercy to his younger siblings, telling the intruders that his brothers were innocent and had not taken part in the street protests.
“They didn't listen to any of that, instead they kept on beating up the boys mercilessly while repeatedly asking, ‘Is it you who usually gets paid to protest?’” said Philip.
He said there were so many attackers that he could not even identify a single face.
Attackers had left
""They were around 40 or so,"" said Philip.
As this was happening, Philip's mother quietly called her brother-in-law, Wycliffe Monari.
But by the time Monari arrived, the attackers had left with one of her sons, Braxton Omae Mogesi.
Mogesi recalled that her son's abductors claimed they were attacking the boys because they had been transported from Nairobi to take part in the July 2, 2024 protest in Kisii town.
Omae's horrific abduction marked the beginning of a long, traumatic search — from police stations to hospital wards and even mortuaries.
Little did his family know that the search would end a week later in a place known as Nyahera in neighbouring Homa Bay County.
""I received a phone call from a stranger indicating that somebody resembling my son had been found dead in Nyahera, Rachuonyo South Sub-county. We rushed there and found the police taking the body to the mortuary at Rachuonyo Sub-county Hospital in Oyugis town. We followed them there and confirmed that it was indeed my son, Braxton,” said the distraught mother.
Braxton's body had very deep cuts on his head and neck, and his scrotum had been severed.
Stone's throw
Police in Rachuonyo South told the family that the body was found lying by the road in Nyahera area, a stone's throw from the Kisii-Homa Bay border.
Dr Tobias Ochola, who conducted a post-mortem examination on the body at Rachuonyo Sub-county Hospital, said strangulation and excessive blood loss caused the death of the 23-year-old man.
Some neck vessels were also gorged out with a circular bruise: “circumferential on the neck, in keeping with a string”.
He also had injuries on his shoulder.
“I cry for justice for my child. I was surprised to hear that he was accused of participating in the protests. We were not aware of this. I wish they informed me of his sins,” Mogesi said in tears.
Contrary to claims that Braxton had travelled from Nairobi to join the protests in Kisii, his mother said her son had been in Kisii all along.
""It is true that he used to be in Nairobi but for the past three months he has been living here with me,” she said.
Monari, Braxton's uncle, condemned his killing and questioned why his nephew was not taken to court if he had broken the law.
“We have no clue about the identity of his killers and their exact motive. If it is true he was a bad boy then he should have been prosecuted and taken to jail. We want to know the truth from Interior Minister Kithure Kindiki and President William Ruto,” he demanded.
Monari said the family was deeply frightened and traumatised.
Extreme fear
Braxton's brother, who was beaten during the abduction, has since sunk into depression and lives in extreme fear, avoiding public appearances.
""We are afraid even as we plan for my nephew's burial. He may have done something wrong which we do not know m, but we plead with the killers to forgive us and spare us and allow us to bury him in peace. We are also pleading with the government to offer us protection,” he urged.
Braxton attended Enoosaen Boys High School in Narok County, where he sat his Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) exam.
""Braxton wanted to go to college and study Information Technology. In fact, they had already discussed this with our mother,"" said his brother Philip.
He was a strong supporter of Shabana FC, a Gusii-based football team.",2024-07-11
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/corporate/companies/bamburi-now-issues-eviction-notice-to-illegal-sand-dealers-4686128,"Listed cement manufacturer Bamburi has issued an eviction notice to sand dealers, transporters and traders who have allegedly encroached part of its land next to its factory in Mavoko, Machakos County.
In the notice issued on Wednesday, the firm asked the traders to immediately cease operations on the land and remove all the structures they had erected on it within three months or face eviction.
Bamburi chief executive officer Mohit Kapoor said the squatters' group, identified as Marimbeti Self Help Group, has unlawfully occupied the parcel without authority or license under any law.
“Take notice that you are in unlawful occupation of LR.NO.18696/3 AND LR 18696/4 in Machakos County (the land) owned by Bamburi Cement PLC without express/lawful authority or without any right or license under any law,” wrote Mr Kapoor in the notice copied to Mavoko Deputy County Commissioner as well as to the OCPD Athi River Division.
“Take notice that at the expiry of three months, we shall evict you without any further reference to you at your costs and peril.”
The notice rekindles memories of recent evictions effected by yet another cement manufacturer – the East African Portland Cement Company (EAPCC) – in the same Mavoko area after hundreds of squatters were accused of failing to regularise their plots.
The cement manufacturer's board of directors had earlier in 2019 resolved to dispose of some of its 16,000 acres of land in Mavoko in a bid to raise Sh45 billion to settle debts and turn the company around.
The residents have, however, been crying foul over alleged land grabbers whom they say are out to disinherit them through threats and forced evictions.
According to the settlers, unknown people were taking advantage of the recent land demolitions by EAPCC to evict the locals from their communal land.",2024-07-10
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/markets/capital-markets/eurobond-yields-fall-shilling-steady-amid-downgrade-4686206,"Interest rates on Kenya’s issued Eurobonds have fallen while the exchange rate remains unchanged, signalling market calm amid the sovereign credit rating downgrade, which has been feared to raise the country’s risk profile in domestic and international markets.
Yields on the Eurobonds have trended lower in recent days in contrast to last week, surprising market observers who had expected the ratings downgrade to drive fear and selloff activity.
The prevalence of calm in the market, which has also seen the Kenya shilling trade within a narrow range and foreign inflows to the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) persist, will be positive news for the government, which had fretted over an adverse reaction to the rating downgrade, including steeper credit costs and investor flight.
Eurobond yields have, however, defied the downvote on the country’s credit rating by falling, with the paper maturing in 2034, for instance, marking the highest gains between Monday morning and Tuesday evening.
The yield on the 2034 Eurobond fell to 10.3506 percent on Tuesday night from 10.4596 percent in early Monday.
The 2027 Eurobond, which traded at 8.7476 percent on Tuesday, marked gains of more than one percent within days, having traded at 10.034 percent on July 4.
The Kenya shilling has, meanwhile, remained largely unchanged but has weakened slightly to trade at Sh128.60 on Tuesday from Sh128.52 on Monday and Sh128.46 on July 4.
Foreign flows to the NSE have remained resilient, with offshore investors registering a net buying position of Sh31.49 million on Tuesday, partly inversing Sh63.27 million in sales on Monday.
A spike in interest rates on the issued Eurobonds would have implied that investors would likely demand a higher return on future debt issuances by Kenya in the international markets as the country is assessed to be at a high risk of debt default.
Standard Investment Bank senior research associate Stellar Swakei says investors have not been reactionary after the ratings downgrade, there being no upcoming maturities in the short term, and from expectations that the government can anchor fiscal consolidation and debt sustainability over the long term.
“I think the maturities are not close enough, and going by that, investors see room for improvement around the fiscal concerns. The markets are also clinging to word that the National Treasury could return to buy back a further $1 billion (Sh128.6 billion) of its outstanding Eurobond notes,” she noted.
Global rating agency Moody’s downgraded Kenya’s credit rating deeper into junk territory on Tuesday, noting the country would struggle to address the high cost and volume of public debt following the withdrawal of the Finance Bill 2024, which sought to bring new revenue-raising measures with the goal of building further gains on fiscal consolidation.
While Eurobond yields have dropped, interest rates on the government’s domestic securities are, however, seen soaring as the Treasury is tipped to increase its local borrowing target in the wake of the frozen revenue-raising measures.
The rating downgrade is not expected to negatively impact the domestic capital markets, as the market regulator notes sound fundamentals that have lifted the NSE bourse to sit among the best-performing stock markets so far in 2024.
“Theirs (Moody’s) is an assessment, but as long as the fundamentals remain strong and investors understand the environment, I do not foresee a further deterioration. Of course, the downgrade is negative, but there is hope that we can resolve our issues. We have been in a worse situation before,” said Capital Markets Authority chief executive Wycliffe Shamiah.",2024-07-10
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/why-kenya-trails-tanzania-in-democracy-index-4686410,"The Kenya democracy index continues to trail Tanzania for four consecutive years on poor scores on electoral process and pluralism, civil liberties and functioning of government, the report shows.
The Democracy Index 2023 report by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), shows that Kenya scored an overall democracy index of 5.05 behind Tanzania’s at 5.35. This score shows no improvement from last year’s index, which has been remained the same since 2020.
Regionally, Kenya was ranked position 14 and globally 92.
According to EIU, “the democracy index is a thick measure of democracy that assesses each country across five categories-electoral process and pluralism, functioning of government, political participation, political culture and civil liberties.”
The electoral process and pluralism metric analyse ability to hold free and fair elections. The functioning of government involves assessing corruption, transparency and accountability by the state. Civil liberties comprise indicators related to freedom of expression and media freedoms.
Kenya scored poorly on electoral process and pluralism with 3.5 out of 10 in 2023.
Other areas that the country scored dismally are civil liberties (4.1 out of 10) and functioning of government (5.3 out of 10).
The report notes; “The failure of political incumbents to uphold democratic values and deliver good governance and economic progress has discredited electoral democracy for increasing numbers of Africans.”
Based on the 2023 National Ethics and Corruption Survey,57.3 percent of respondents perceived corruption level to be high in the country, with 24.7 percent citing high cost of living as the main reason.
Notably, the freedom of assembly though guaranteed by the Constitution has been undermined in Kenya. The police responded to Opposition protests in March 2023 with tear gas and live ammunition.
Three years after the Covid-19 pandemic, which translated to a rollback of freedoms across the world, the 2023 democracy results for Kenya indicate a continuing democratic malaise and no forward momentum.",2024-07-10
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/markets/capital-markets/property-fund-fahari-starts-restricted-trading-4686188,"Property fund ILAM Fahari I-Reit has begun trading on the Nairobi Securities Exchange's unquoted securities platform, bringing the firm back to the bourse on a restricted market after its delisting from the main investment segment in February.
The Reit’s shares (units) were available for trading on the platform yesterday at a fixed price of Sh11, which represents the price at which a section of minority investors were bought out last year by ICEA Lion Asset Management Limited.
ICEA Lion is also the manager of the real estate investment trust (Reit).
Investors seeking to buy into the Reit are obligated to acquire a minimum of 454,545 units worth Sh5 million in the fund based on the offering's restricted status, where high net worth or professional traders dominate.
The Reit manager expects the price per unit to grow based on the revaluation of the property fund, helping to cure part of the challenges that prompted the fund's removal from the NSE’s main market segment.
“We are at the redemption price and have indicated going forward what will happen in terms of the price. Obviously, there will be an opportunity for price discovery, and that is something we will see over time as the Reit continues to trade,” said ICEA Lion Asset Management CEO Einstein Kihanda.
The Reit's price going forward is expected to be dictated by three valuation methods, including the income, market, and asset approach.
The income approach is based on the discounting of cash flows to determine the intrinsic value, while the market approach compares the volume-weighted average share price of the Reit and the offer price. The asset approach uses the net assets of the business to determine its value.
ICEA Lion began the restructuring of the property fund by buying out minority investors at a premium price and subsequently delisting the security for the NSE. The Reit promoter is also seeking to review the fund's investment portfolio in addition to the price discovery goal.
“What we now have is a platform to undertake the restructuring process in terms of reviewing our property portfolio and building a pipeline of property investments. The restructure will reposition the Reit for growth,” added Mr Kihanda.
ILAM Fahari became the first Reit in East Africa in September of 2015 and listed on the NSE in November of the same year, raising Sh3.6 billion.
The listing of the fund on the Unquoted Securities Platform (USP) is targeted at providing liquidity to the remaining unitholders.
The Reit narrowed its net loss last year by 99 percent to Sh297,642 from a loss of Sh28.3 million previously.
The improved performance was attributed largely to a reduction in the fair value loss on investment property at Greenspan Mall Limited. The market value of its property portfolio fell slightly to Sh2.93 billion from Sh3.11 billion previously.
ICEA Lion Life Assurance and ICEA Lion Asset Management Limited hold a combined stake of 23.87 percent in the fund represented by 43.2 million units.",2024-07-10
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/lifestyle/food-drinks/linda-hits-a-lucrative-market-with-healthy-organic-ketchup-4686230,"When Linda Korir decided to venture into entrepreneurship, like the engineer she is, she made her calculations with precision, narrowing down to a product that would guarantee her success.
In a world dominated by synthetic flavours and preservatives, Linda established that there were few organic ketchup brands in the local market. The slim pickings were priced expensively, forcing consumers, already hard hit by high inflation, to stick with the unhealthy varieties.
The 30-year-old who has been passionate about agriculture since childhood was determined to work out a solution to this condiment problem.
“When I enrolled at Miramar International College to learn about hydroponics, I met a friend who was learning about tomato farming. I was tempted to join him, but I wanted to do some value addition venture to reduce wastage,” she says.
The organic ketchup business idea came naturally.
“Our products are all-natural. They have no fillers, no colours, no chemicals. Instead of sugar, we use jaggery. It may not be good for diabetes, but it’s a healthier option,” says Linda, the co-founder of Nutriblends.
She and her partner Precious Mbinya started the business with an initial investment of Sh10,000.
“We started with some tomatoes, ginger, garlic, onion and jaggery in Kenya Industrial Research And Development Institute (Kirdi) in South C, where we rented a room for Sh50 and did our production,” says Linda who worked for the Kenya National Highways Authority before the entrepreneurship bug bit her.
They source raw materials from local farmers in Kitengela and Ruiru at a price of Sh90 per kilo for tomatoes, but she says the price can be lower depending on the season.
The self-proclaimed productive engineer says, “I knew from the beginning that this business would be successful. I am a very positive person.”
The entrepreneurs target health-conscious clientele with five categories of organic sauces, including sweet and smoked chilli, sweet, premium spicy barbecue sauce, tomato and herb ketchup and habanero with pineapple.
“The ingredients used depend on the product you want to make, but the end product looks the same as other ketchup brands. The difference is that this is organic. In terms of income levels, because the products are premium, we are targeting a middle to upper income clientele because of the cost of the ingredients,” she says.
Growth and distribution
The business has grown from just her and her partner to nine employees (three permanent and four casual) since its products hit the market seven months ago.
“We have a pick-up station in Nairobi's Central Business District where our retailers pick them up. We also sell to restaurants, but with growing demand and enough manpower, we are looking at getting into online stores like Greenspoon and eventually supermarkets,” she says optimistically.
“We have seen the acceptance of the products in the market. The growth has been fantastic. People are embracing the change and we believe it will be a big thing in the market. The startup is in a growth process. We want our business to grow naturally,” she says.
Challenges
With many start-ups collapsing within five years of launch, Linda says their journey has not been a walk in the park. There have been plenty of bottlenecks, but aggressiveness keeps them going.
“The business is very interesting; we’ve had ups and downs. But it requires aggressiveness. However, there are challenges such as financing, marketing, and it is also challenging to do production in small bits because it takes a lot of time and resources. It stretches me a lot,” she says.
“I see Nutriblends as a household brand. And owned by our children and grandchildren. A company that grows to be a blessing to others, a healthy company,” she adds.",2024-07-10
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/why-court-declined-to-temporarily-suspend-the-housing-levy-4686956,"The High Court has declined to temporarily suspend sections of the Affordable Housing Act including the collection of the housing levy, stating that public interest is tilted in favour of allowing the law to operate until the petitions are decided.
A bench of three judges said that laws enacted by Parliament enjoy the presumption of constitutionality and the court cannot stop them unless it is demonstrated that there is a risk of being violated.
Six petitions were filed challenging various provisions of the Affordable Housing Act, 2023 and were consolidated before Chief Justice Martha Koome appointed Justices Olga Sewe, John Chigiti, and Josephine Mong’are to determine the cases.
“It is our finding, therefore, that the petitioners have failed to show that the impugned provisions pose a danger to life or limb or that they threaten the Bill of Rights to warrant the orders sought. We are not persuaded that the petition will be rendered nugatory if the orders sought are not granted,” the judges said.
The judges said that they did not doubt that the affordable housing levy had generated a lot of public interest with divergent arguments on its constitutionality.
The petitioners’ among them Magare Gikenyi had argued that since the board to manage the fund was not in place and there was no clarity as to the collector, the money would be exposed to theft and misappropriation in violation of Article 10(2) of the Constitution, which provides for principles of national values and good governance, integrity, transparency, and accountability.
They further pointed out that the job of the Commissioner General of the Kenya Revenue Authority is restricted to the affairs of the authority and not collecting the levy.
The court was further informed that the housing levy was placed at 1.5 percent without a study to show how the fund would be operating yet no money should be collected from the public without an expenditure line and a fully functional fund established as required by law.
The government defended the law arguing that any Act of Parliament enjoys the presumption of constitutionality.
Parliament also submitted that the Act establishes the legal framework for the collection of the levy and the collection of levies is not abnormal in Kenya. It gave examples of road maintenance levy and the petroleum levy as similar initiatives.
President William Ruto signed into law the Affordable Housing Bill, 2023 in March 2024 paving the way for the resumption of the deduction of the levy, which had earlier been stopped by the court.
Employees are deducted 1.5 percent of their gross monthly pay, matched by the employer.
Under the new law, Kenyans in the informal sector and others not salaried also pay 1.5 percent of their monthly gross earnings to fund President Ruto’s pet housing project.
Dr Gikenyi, one of the petitioners wants the court to declare that there was no sufficient public participation before the law was passed.
He also argues that the Act's sections 3, which establishes the levy, and 4, which imposes it, are unconstitutional as they are a threat to social and economic rights and are inconsistent with the Constitution.
The petitioners have also sought the quashing of the Government Financial Management (Kenya Slum Upgrading, Low-Cost Housing, and Infrastructure Trust Fund) Regulations in its entirety and for the State to be compelled to refund the amounts already collected from Kenyans.
“Articles 10, 21(3), and 201 require tax measures to be socially just, adequate, equitable, and progressive and must not disproportionately shift the tax burden to the poor and marginalised,” one of the petitioners submitted.
The petitioners will be urging the court to compel the State to conduct a human rights impact assessment of the tax measures proposed to fund any government programme and a permanent injunction imposed, barring the Ruto administration from imposing any tax without conducting the said assessment.
The Cabinet Secretaries for Lands and the National Treasury dockets, the Attorney-General as well as the National Assembly have opposed the case.
The judges noted that the petitioners were asking the court to suspend the operation of some sections of the law on an application without hearing the petitions on merit.
They said in principle, there is a general presumption that statutes enacted by Parliament are constitutional until the contrary is proved and such a drastic order cannot be issued on an application.
The judges said the hearing of the case would be prioritised.",2024-07-11
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/corporate/technology/ict-authority-revives-push-to-accredit-all-service-providers-4686140,"The Information, Communication, and Technology (ICT) Authority has revived a proposal to accredit all service providers in the sector, setting the stage for renewed clashes with industry players.
In the ICT Authority Bill 2024, the regulator is seeking to compel all service providers in the industry to register even as it also seeks additional powers to oversee the ICT sector, in addition to providing the services for State offices.
This proposal has been rejected multiple times before, the latest being in 2022, when the proposal sailed through the national assembly but former president Uhuru Kenyatta declined to assent to it following concerns raised by the industry that it would limit innovation by locking out some IT professionals as well as trainees and youth hoping to join the sector.
The Bill sets requirements such as registration fees before one is registered to practice.
“A person who intends to provide ICT services to any entity shall apply to the Authority for accreditation in a prescribed manner and upon payment of the required fee,” says the bill that has this week been subjected to public participation before being tabled in parliament.
If the Bill sails through lawmakers and gets presidential assent this time, all ICT practitioners and service providers will be required to have a minimum qualification requirement and some experience before applying for accreditation by the authority.
The accreditation will be renewed annually at a fee not yet determined, and the authority will have the power to revoke a practitioner’s licence at any time if they are deemed to have acted against “public interest” or contravened the terms of their accreditation.
Anyone who will provide ICT services without the prerequisite accreditation will be penalised by imprisonment for up to five years, or fined at most Sh5 million, the bill proposes.
While the bill does not clearly define who an ICT service provider is, it could affect professionals such as computer scientists, web and app developers, software and hardware engineers, internet service providers, and IT support staff across both private and public sectors.
Stakeholders in the industry have criticised the bill as being detrimental to the industry, saying it is likely to stifle innovation and should be shot down multiple times as it happened previously.",2024-07-10
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/opinion-analysis/columnists/no-sunset-yet-for-solar-energy-4685980,"Solar power is about to end fossil fuels' dominance in the global energy market, supplying most of the world's electricity, transportation, and heating. Although fossil fuels are finite and harmful, they are also costly and unreliable. In contrast, solar energy is abundant, clean, and inexpensive, and it can be used practically anywhere on earth.
Solar energy is fast becoming more accessible and affordable, altering the energy landscape because of technology advancements and increased productivity.
The Economist on June 22nd predicted that ""solar cells will in all likelihood be the single biggest source of electrical power on the planet by the mid-2030s."" Solar energy is expanding at an unprecedented rate.
The publication reported that installed solar capacity doubles every three years and grows tenfold. This expansion will have a significant impact on the cost of power, lowering it to less than half of the lowest accessible now. Some foreign missions in Nairobi are already utilising solar to power themselves.
The world, and more specifically Africa, where many still lack electricity, will begin to feel the effects of this energy richness. The continent has abundant solar resources, with an average of more than 300 sunny days per year. Yet, it also faces severe energy challenges, with more than half of its population lacking access to reliable and modern energy services.
Many African countries rely on expensive and unreliable imports of fossil fuels or suffer from frequent power outages and poor grid infrastructure. Solar energy offers a viable alternative that can address these challenges and unlock Africa's economic potential.
As the price of solar energy declines, barriers to its widespread adoption remain. The high upfront cost of solar panels and installation is still a challenge. Although solar energy can save money in the long run, many potential users lack the capital or credit to invest in solar systems. Therefore, upfront tax incentives that cut the initial cost or provide financial benefits for using solar energy can play a crucial role in accelerating the transition to a solar-powered world.
Power in every home will significantly reduce food waste and improve food security in Africa.
Solar energy can provide decentralised and off-grid solutions that can reach remote and rural areas, where most of the energy-poor live. It can also reduce dependence on fossil fuel imports and improve energy security and sovereignty.
Moreover, solar energy can create jobs, stimulate local industries, and foster innovation and entrepreneurship. Solar energy can also support sustainable development and environmental protection by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and enhancing resilience to climate change.
To realise the vision of universal energy provision, the continent must overcome several other barriers and challenges that hinder the widespread adoption and deployment of solar energy. These include a lack of adequate financing, policy frameworks, technical skills, and public awareness, as well as competing interests, vested interests, and corruption.
Thus, there is a need to create an enabling environment and a supportive ecosystem for solar energy. This entails investing in infrastructure, capacity building, innovation, and governance, as well as promoting regional cooperation, knowledge sharing, and best practices.
There is, therefore, an urgent need to phase out subsidies and tax breaks for fossil fuels, which distort the energy market and create an unfair advantage for dirty and expensive sources of energy. By removing these incentives, governments can level the playing field and allow solar energy to compete on its own merits.
Additionally, governments can introduce carbon pricing mechanisms that reflect the true social and environmental costs of fossil fuels and make solar energy more attractive and affordable. Furthermore, governments can allocate more public funds and mobilise more private capital for solar energy projects, especially in underserved and marginalised areas.
This can be achieved by providing grants, loans, guarantees, or other forms of financial support, as well as creating conducive regulatory and legal frameworks that reduce risks and barriers for investors and developers.
By reducing investments in expensive sources of energy and prioritising the emerging role of solar power, Africa can unlock its vast potential for clean and renewable energy and benefit from its multiple advantages.",2024-07-10

The recently oversubscribed water infrastructure green bond by the Tanga Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Authority (Tanga UWASA) highlights the huge capital market potential for major projects.
Launched on February 22, 2024, and listed on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE) on May 15, 2024, the TZS 53.12 billion (Sh2.575 billion) issue attracted impressive response from investors, both domestic and foreign.
The Tanga UWASA bond saw a 103 percent oversubscription, with 65 percent coming from local investors and 35 percent from foreign investors. Nicodemus Mkama, CEO of the Tanzania Capital Market and Securities Authority, acknowledged the bond's success as a turning point for the country's capital markets.
Kenya has explored similar financing options for infrastructure projects. The Kenya Association of Stockbrokers and Investment Banks (KASIB) has taken an initiative to help water companies obtain funding through the capital market with its County Bonds Financing Programme.
Using this programme, water service providers (WSPs) can raise funds through the capital markets to be invested in smart water metering, expansion of the water reticulation network, and replacement of old and leaking pipes.
The Kenya Pooled Water Fund project previously made an unsuccessful attempt to raise Sh10 billion using a local bond. To fill the Sh995 billion funding deficit, the government gave the green light to water companies to borrow money from the capital markets.
The successful adoption of water/infrastructure bonds in Kenya might result in numerous benefits.
The purpose of water bonds such as Tanga UWASA's is to finance environmentally conscious projects. Additionally, due to restricted funding, the government often encounters project execution delays. Bond issuances can support government initiatives as a competitive substitute for conventional funding sources.
By leveraging the capital markets to raise funds for water infrastructure projects, we can attract both domestic and international investors, which will increase market liquidity and stimulate cash flows. It will also provide diversification opportunities for investor portfolios.
To emulate Tanzania's feat Kenya must take important actions to create a favourable atmosphere for sustainable bond issuance.
A clear and supportive regulatory framework must first be in place. This includes accelerated approval procedures and providing incentives for green projects. To streamline the process, all approvals should be centralised under a single regulator, such as the Capital Markets Authority.
Another critical step is strengthening the capacity of institutions and stakeholders to create and manage bond projects through training programmes. The government should also encourage private public partnerships to share resources and expertise.
Finally, focus should be put on increasing investor confidence through openness, accountability, and consistency.

https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/unqualified-officials-denying-kenya-favourable-loan-terms-4686346,"Treasury has been dispatching unqualified persons to negotiate loans on behalf of Kenya, resulting in expensive loans with harsh terms for the country, an audit has revealed.
An audit of contracts for external loans for development projects faults the Treasury for failing to undertake proper market research on the terms of loans tapped, mainly due to limited skills by officials in its debt office.
Auditor-General Nancy Gathungu sampled six debt-funded projects including the Mwache Dam and the Kenol-Sagana-Marua Road, currently facing delays due to the failure of the government to fulfill creditors’ terms.
She noted that incapacity at Treasury’s debt department has left officers failing to review terms such as penalty fees, other charges, and currency before borrowing from different countries and multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF).
“Interviews with the staff of the Debt Policy, Strategy, and Risk Management Department revealed that inadequate staff and skills in debt management attributed to this shortfall,” Ms Gathungu said.
She added that while the office should have 19 officers, it had only six as at October last year.
The shortage of staff and skills at the office, the audit noted, had caused the Treasury to negotiate loans with harsh terms for taxpayers, including punitive penalties, procurement conditions, and financing clauses.
Treasury brushed off the audit query on failure to undertake financial analysis on loans to ensure it borrows at cheapest rates stating, in a response within the report, that “The comment is erroneous and onerous.”
The audit noted that “for effective loan negotiation, the negotiating team should comprise of well-trained professionals who can meaningfully engage the experienced negotiating teams of creditor institutions or countries”, including representatives from debt office and Attorney-General AG).
Besides the incapacity issues, the audit faulted Treasury for ignoring legal advice from the AG.
“However, review of financing agreements for the sampled projects revealed that two out of six sampled projects have co-financing clauses which have a negative impact on the contracted loans,” the audit notes.
The audit cites a clause in the Mwache Dam Project loan, issued by the International Development Association (IDA) and Agence Francaise De Development (AFD), stating that a drawdown request could not be submitted to the lender if a co-financier had suspended any payments on the project.
Under the financing agreement for the Nairobi Water and Sanitation Project, the audit also flags a clause stating that if the borrower prepays any amount due to a co-financier in full or in part before the technical completion date, they must prepay the entire or a portion of the facility within 30 calendar days.
“Therefore, in the event a new financier is introduced and prepayment occurs, this clause may have a negative impact on liquidity position of the government. Therefore, Treasury should have negotiated for removal of these clauses from the financing agreements to avoid these risks,” Ms Gathungu says.
The audit also notes that lenders are imposing harsh terms due to Kenya’s incapacity to negotiate better terms, including dictations on procurement.
Besides the incapacity issues, the audit faults Treasury for ignoring legal advice from the AG, where it notes that “legal advices to negotiate for amendment of some of the clauses and fulfilment of conditions precedent were not considered in four out of six sampled loans.”
The failure to negotiate loans in line with legal advice, the public auditor notes, poses risks of the government signing loans with unfavourable terms and stalling of projects.
The report reveals that had the government engaged residents of Kenol, Murang’a County before it started constructing the Kenol-Sagana-Marua Highway in 2020, probably the road would have been completed by December 2024, at a cheaper cost.
Instead, the Treasury and the Kenya National Highways Authority (Kenha) went ahead to borrow billions of shillings armed with an obsolete design, resulting in heavy cost implications that have delayed works and exposed the government’s recklessness to satisfy its borrowing appetite.
The audit notes that the initial road design, for instance, did not consider the need for footbridges where primary school pupils cross, exposing them to the dangers of being hit by speeding Miraa vehicles.
“Further, the project affected the existing markets, boda-boda stages, and sheds at Kenol-Makuyu Junction and Kenol Town. The affected beneficiaries need relocation of these facilities to safer places for free movements and interactions with their customers,” the audit notes, indicating that even the consultant handling the road has acknowledged that the residents’ concerns “were important and new design proposals had been submitted to KeNHA with additional cost implications.”
“Failure to involve public causing challenges such as land acquisition disputes, delays in project implementation, and increase in costs. These costs could be avoided with proper identification and planning,” Auditor-General Nancy Gathungu states.
But the Kenol-Sagana-Marua road is just the tip of the iceberg, as the public auditor, exposes loopholes in borrowing processes to fund projects, including the use of obsolete feasibility studies, the Treasury’s refusal to follow legal advice, and the inability of its officials to bargain better terms for taxpayers.
The audit notes that despite ignoring public views when identifying and planning for projects to undertake, the government has also been hurriedly entering into harsh loans that end up attracting penalties and causing delays, denying Kenyans value for their taxes.
Ms Gathungu sampled six projects including the Kenol-Sagana-Marua road, Bagamoyo-Horohoro-Lunga Lunga-Malindi road, and Mwache Dam, all of which residents said they were never involved in the projects’ identification.
“Interviews with implementing agencies revealed that financiers approach ministries directly before projects are conceptualized by the users or project implementing ministries,” the audit notes.
The feasibility studies Treasury used to borrow for the Kenol-Sagana-Marua and Bagamoyo-Horohoro-Lunga Lunga-Malindi roads, had to be updated since while they were drawn in 2009, the projects started in 2020.
The audit notes that a “top to bottom” approach by the State when implementing loan-funded projects has created “a disconnect from grassroots beneficiaries unlike demand-driven where a project is identified through a bottom to top approach which is highly decentralized and people-centric.”
It notes that during the conceptualisation of Mwache Dam in Kwale County, for instance, planners failed to consider the relocation of Fulugani primary school, leaving pupils whose parents had already been moved far away traveling long distances.
“Interview with the Deputy Principal of the school and the Chair of the School Board of Management revealed that the school population had dropped by about 22 percent, from 1,230 to 960 students. The drop was attributed to young learners being unable to walk long distances and parents' concern about heavy vehicles plying the road which may result in accidents,” Ms Gathungu indicated.",2024-07-10

Amsons Group, which is a family-run business with operations in Tanzania, Zambia, Malawi, Mozambique, Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi said Wednesday it has signed a binding offer with Bamburi Cement. The deal could see Bamburi, one of Kenya’s iconic blue-chip companies, delisted from the Nairobi Securities Exchange.
Amsons Group Managing Director Edha Nahdi said the proposed deal will deepen the group’s position in the cement sector in East Africa as part of the regional economic development and market integration ideals.
“We have great plans to deepen our investment in Kenya and in Bamburi,” said Mr Nahdi on the impending deal.
“Our offer to acquire shares in Bamburi is part of our corporate market expansion plan and will mark the formal entry of Amsons Group into the Kenyan market, where we plan to make investments in other industries in the coming months.”
The group issued the notice of intention to launch the public take-over offer through its Kenyan subsidiary and investment vehicle, Amsons Industries (K) Ltd, in a deal that will see Bamburi shareholders paid Sh65 per share.
At Sh65 per share, Amsons’ cash offer represents a premium of Sh20 per share or 44.4 percent gain, given that Bamburi share closed Wednesday trade at the NSE at Sh45 a share.
Bamburi is majority owned by Holcim through two investment vehicles—Fincem Holding Limited and Kencem Holding Limited—with a combined stake of 58.3 percent.
“This agreement to sell our stake in Bamburi Cement advances Holcim’s strategy of extending our leadership in our core markets as the global leader in innovative and sustainable building solutions,” said Martin Kriegner, regional head of Asia, Middle East & Africa at Holcim.
Amsons Group was founded in 2006 in Tanzania and now has more than $1 billion (Sh128.5 billion) in annual turnover. Its main business operations historically involved bulk oil and petroleum products importation under the Camel Oil Tanzania retail brand.
The group has, over time, grown its portfolio in the manufacturing sector with a 6,000 metric tonnes per day cement manufacturing capability, including through the recently acquired Mbeya Cement facility.",2024-07-10

We assume people make unemotional rational decisions. Theory of Games and Economic Behaviour written by John von Neuman and Oskar Morgenstein, published in 1947 is the classic on the rules of rationality.
Imagine you go into a shop for a sandwich and the lady behind the counter says she has only chicken or beef and you say, “Oh, let me have beef”. Then the lady says, “Oh I forgot I also have ham.” You respond, “Let me change my order to chicken.”
One can’t be considered rational if you change your order, just because you found they also have ham. If one assumes people are rational, then financial markets should be too.
Myth of rationality
Problem is that the idea of the person described in economic’s course 101 - who acts to maximise their utility in a rational way is a bit of a myth.

Rain dancing or creating real insights?
Before you shoot off on the next business planning retreat, consider the thoughts of the Dartmouth professor, Brian Quinn who notes: “A good deal of the corporate planning I have observed is like a ritual rain dance; it has no effect on the weather that follows, but those that engage in it think it does.
Moreover, it seems to me that much of the advice and instruction related to corporate planning is directed at improving the dancing not the weather.”
Is planning wrong? No, it’s just typically poorly done. Insightful strategic planning combines hard analysis with creativity, taking into account the turbulent business environment. Why do managers have this addiction to notion of believing they can plan accurately long into the future? Perhaps it is the idea that they don’t want to regret the opportunity of ‘giving it a shot’, even if they know, what they plan for, is unlikely to happen the way they think it will?
Let’s imagine for the moment that there are two ways to do strategic planning by analogy and going back to first principles. One is much easier than the other. These days it would be easier to create a quite polished business plan by accessing artificial intelligence and programme like Chat GPT. Whether it would have the buy-in of senior managers, is another issue.
Strategy begins by addressing the real-on-the ground problems facing the organisation. It does not start with blue sky notions of some [inevitably] glorious vision and mission statements.
First principles thinking is one of the most effective planning approaches managers can employ for breaking down complicated problems and generating original solutions. It is also the single best approach to learn how to think for yourself.
First principles approach has been used by many great thinkers including printing press inventor Johannes Gutenberg, military strategist John Boyd, and philosopher Aristotle. Based on his training in physics Elon Musk, has used first principles thinking more effectively than most.
To evade a sense of regret - that your strategic planning exercise was a waste of time, consider approaching problems with both a blend of using analogy and first principles thinking.
Forget doing age-old worn-out SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) exercise, focus on being [numbers and facts] analytical, using inductive logic, setting a hypothesis of what one thinks is happening, then doing the objective research to prove, or disprove what you think may be true.
Don’t try and be all things, to all people. Strategy is about making trade-offs, about creating value along a chain of activities. What is the unique value proposition for the customers, and how does one price the offering? It is about choosing what not to do, as much what to focus on. This is not easy, it forces managers to question fundamental assumptions, and conventional wisdom.
Avoid that feeling of regret. “Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn’t do than by the ones you did do,” said Mark Twain, a writer.",2024-07-10
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/corporate/enterprise/how-we-broke-into-the-global-markets-4686310,"One of the most profound and well-documented gaps in entrepreneurship is the gender gap. While many women in Africa, are entrepreneurs, very few of their businesses are likely to attract investment, go global, and scale.
And while access to finance is a big barrier, the major issues that women-led SMEs face are non-financial.
“As we spoke to the women founders they told us, ‘yes, we need access to finance. That's a big thing. But then there is also the non-financial stuff. Like; how do you make sure you have a business continuity plan? How do you make sure that your mental wellness is okay? How do you interact with the different organisations and the government? What about branding, sourcing and keeping employees happy?’” Posed Elizabeth Wasunna, the Absa Bank Kenya business banking director.
According to Ms Wasunna, the three things that matter most to women entrepreneurs are access to finance, networks and mentorship, and coaching.
These issues hinder women-led businesses, especially when it comes to accessing emerging markets and attracting investors and, therefore, their companies remain small.
Ms Wasunna was speaking at the 2034 Absa InspireMe Conference where in partnership with International Trade Centre (ITC) SheTrades where 10,000 businesswomen from across Africa gathered in Nairobi.
To understand the challenges African women entrepreneurs, face while scaling businesses, the BDLife spoke to five women have managed to grow their businesses across borders. They give practical advice on how to get women out of their comfort zones and reach new heights.
Veronicah Gakio, founder AnkoleJewels, makes jewellery from horn, brass, and semi-precious stones. Also, produces crotchet bags finished with genuine kenyan leather. Sells in Kenya, UAE, and the US.
“I started my business in November 2019, right before the Covid pandemic. Though I worked in human resources in Dubai for nine years, I loved unique jewellery. When I came back to Kenya, I worked for a company that was doing jewellery which inspired me to start my own company.
I have always wanted to have that piece of jewellery that nobody else has. In my early 20s, I'd buy jewellery and then combine it with others for unique pieces. And that's precisely what I offer in my brand—custom-made pieces. I'm focused on the unique aspect of my items.
I started by bootstrapping from my savings. The beauty of my business is if someone gives me a big order, they have to pay 50 percent upfront.
While my company is fairly young, I have clients not only from Kenya but also from the United Arab Emirates, the US and even India. It’s a 50/50 split between retailers and resellers. In my business, the international market does better because that's where I get most clients.
I feel like foreigners, especially in the US appreciate more hand-made items and the sentiment of ‘one-person trash is another one treasure’.
What has helped me scale fairly quickly is the power of social media. Most clients visit my Instagram page and order the items, which I courier to them. I do sponsored posts on Instagram and decide which location to focus on. One has to target the right audience with each post. But sometimes as much as we try, we may get the wrong audience.
The biggest challenge I face, like most of the exporters, is the high airfreight costs. For example, the price of shipping a pair of earrings can be equivalent to their price.
I would tell those wanting to scale not to limit themselves and try to be as unique as possible. Don't just go for something quick to make. Do things that stand out. Be unique. It might be expensive to make unique things, but it pays at the end of the day because people identify you. Network as much as possible. Don't shy off from talking to people, thinking that you're disturbing them. Sell yourself.
Don't limit yourself and talk about your brand. Introduce yourself, and what you do, and people will appreciate what you're doing.”
Anita Kittoe, Oye Bags and Clothing founder: From hobby to empowering local artisans
Anita Kittoe, the creative director and founder of Oye Bags and Clothing in Accra, Ghana, has transformed her side hobby into a flourishing business over the past eight years. Initially working full-time in banking, Anita crafted tote bags and clothes in her spare time.
“It started off as a hobby and then five years into it, I left banking and then I've been doing it full-time since,” Anita shares.
This transition has enabled her to travel, network, and collaborate with other entrepreneurs globally, including trips to Egypt and Kenya. “We sell in the UK, US, Ghana and Kenya. Our focus from last year is to expand within the continent,” Anita says.
Oye Bags and Clothing is also a platform that supports local artisans and suppliers. “Not only is the business generating income but also creating a livelihood for local artisans, and suppliers who supply raw materials,” she says.
Anita says collaboration with stakeholders has been instrumental in expanding her business and accessing new markets.
“I am a member of SheTrades, Ghana Export Promotion Agency (GEPA), and Ghana Enterprises Agency (GEA). Ghana Trade House was launched in Kenya by GEPA and this has enabled SMEs to access the market,” she says.
Attending international events, and trade fairs and doing pop-up markets have been crucial in Oye's growth. These events offer networking opportunities and inspiration from like-minded entrepreneurs.
“Meeting others who have faced and overcome similar challenges provides motivation and reinforces the belief that growth and success are attainable,” she says.
Oye Bags and Clothing currently operates two shops in Accra and has stockists in the US and the UK, including locations in Atlanta, New York, and London. The brand also leverages online sales, shipping products worldwide via DHL.
“Social media has been very good to us since many people today don't like going to shops,” she says.
Anita says financing has been a significant challenge, and she initially relied on her salary, high-interest microfinance loans, and support from family and friends.
“Ghana interest rates are super high—35-40 percent. I just signed off on a loan and the interest rate is almost 40 percent,” Anita who says access to grants has eased her burden, shares.
Anita emphasises the importance of organic growth and patience. Aspiring exporters should develop their products to meet international standards and grow naturally to avoid overextending their capacity. Ensuring product quality and readiness for the global market is also paramount.
“You need to develop your product to a certain level and be confident that your product is ready for the international market. There are all of these regulations out there. You need to check with your local agencies and be sure that your product is safe to go out in the first,” she advises.
Anita notes the difficulties in collecting payments and the complexities of shipping products within Africa compared to markets like the UK and the US. Addressing these issues is crucial for smoother expansion and operational efficiency.
“It’s as simple as ‘how do I get paid? This is a major problem across Africa. It's easy for someone to send me money from the UK than from here in Kenya. So one has to figure out a way,” she says.
Francesca B Apeagyei, Nguvu Global co-founder: Empowering women and expanding shea cosmetics across continents
Francesca B. Apeagyei, alongside her sister, co-founded Nguvu Global Limited, a social enterprise based in Accra, Ghana. Specialising in shea cosmetics and natural oils, Nguvu operates a processing centre in northern Ghana, where shea nuts grow wild.
Here, they support 1,500 women from nearby communities who pick and process the shea nuts into butter, which Nguvu Global then buys, processes further with natural oils and fragrances, and exports.
Nguvu Global's shea cosmetics are available in Melcom, Ghana's largest supermarket chain, and at the Accra airports, among other local shops. Internationally, they extend their reach to Kenya, Liberia, South Africa, the US, and the UK. This impressive growth in just four years stems from a blend of strategic location, partnerships, and leveraging local resources.
The business idea originated from Francesca's sister’s Master's research on women in marginalised area development, which highlighted the economic potential of shea butter. Recognising the disparity between resource availability and local poverty, the sisters aimed to create a sustainable and empowering business model.
“She realised that we were sitting on a natural resource that could be catapulted into something large,” says Francesca who shares the company name Nguvu, means strength in Swahili, symbolises the collective strength of women.
Francesca and her sister have navigated significant challenges, including the Covid-19 pandemic, which led Francesca to pivot from her travel business to focus entirely on shea cosmetics. This period was used to refine product formulations and explore online sales, leading to increased local and international demand.
“The travel business had collapsed, and I was looking for a way to pay the rent. Shea had potential, if we were to put the structures in place in terms of logistics, pricing, packaging, and promotion. I used the lockdown period to test my product on my friends. I would rather test on my friends who won't sue me than random people,” Francesca says of the formulations she started producing from her kitchen counter.
Their international expansion strategy involved leveraging Francesca's marketing expertise and taking calculated risks, such as personally travelling to new markets like South Africa and Kenya to establish connections and understand market needs. Collaborations with the Ghana Export Promotion Authority (GEPA) also played a crucial role in entering new markets, such as through trade shows and establishing trade houses.
Being a female entrepreneur in Ghana presented additional challenges, particularly in accessing finance. Francesca often found that her proposals were not taken seriously by male-dominated financial institutions. To overcome this, she strategically involved a male financial coach in meetings to secure necessary funding.
“They (males executives) look at you like a young girl trying to do business. So they toss you about. Or they are hearing, but they are not listening to you. I decided to go to meetings with a male financial coach because he would speak the mathematics and shake hands and I'll just be quiet and get my money. My work would continue. I found that to be a smart way of getting what I want without having to fight all the time,” she says.
Logistical challenges, particularly high shipping costs and long transit times within Africa, have been significant obstacles.
“Business revolves around time. The customers are impatient. If the product is low on stock in Kenya and I need to quickly send stock, it means that by default, if I use flight, I'm going to lose money. That customer is not going to wait 30 to 90 days for shipping. That customer is quickly going to move on to a product that's available and ready on the shelf. It's a tough business call,” she says.
By partnering with government institutions like the Ghana Shippers Authority and GEPA, Nguvu Global has been able to mitigate some of these costs and streamline its shipping processes.
Looking ahead, Nguvu Global aims to solidify its presence in five key African markets—Kenya, South Africa, Egypt, Morocco, and either Uganda or Rwanda—alongside expanding into European and Middle Eastern markets such as Germany and Dubai. The ultimate goal is to position Nguvu Global as a leading African brand in the global cosmetics industry, comparable to European luxury brands.
Francesca emphasises the importance of travel and firsthand market exploration. She advocates for personally visiting new markets to gain practical insights, build connections, and understand consumer preferences.
Adowa Koren Dejean-Lynch, CEO BEEyond Honey Collection: Innovating food security and honey production in Rwanda
Adowa Koren Dejean-Lynch is an African British Caribbean entrepreneur based in Kigali, Rwanda. Her journey to Rwanda began two years ago with a mission to address food insecurity and climate change through innovative agricultural solutions.
Her first product, Microgreens, is a crop that grows in just 14 days using minimal water and no fertilisers, making it ideal for urban settings and small spaces like patios.
A year into her venture, Adowa expanded her focus to pollination, recognising the critical role bees play in crop production. She noticed the discrepancy in honey production between countries like Ethiopia and Rwanda and sought to create a premium honey product that could compete on an international scale. BEEyond Honey Collection blends honey with spices, herbs, and alcohol, creating a unique product range aimed at wellness and premium markets.
“I wanted to produce a premium brand coming out of Africa for the International market,” Adowa who draws inspiration from her African and Caribbean heritage says.
Starting in 2022, Adowa faced significant challenges, from cultural and logistical hurdles to financial constraints. Despite knowing no one in Rwanda and relying on support from her family, she stayed focused and driven.
“What keeps me grounded is being focused. You have to be able to wear many hats. You don't have to be brilliant at your idea, but begin with what you've got. Be prepared to learn and listen because as the business grows you will get people who want to bolt your business and give you the support you need,” Adowa says.
BEEyond Honey Collection's pilot in Rwanda proved successful, leading to plans for expansion into Kenya and beyond. Adowa aims to produce 40,000 units in the first year of full-scale production, positioning her product as a premium brand both in Africa and internationally. She is exploring opportunities for manufacturing in Kenya and has received interest from the SheTrades Initiative for exporting to the UK.
Adowa advises aspiring entrepreneurs to be honest with themselves, stay dedicated, and surround themselves with supportive mentors and peers. She highlights the importance of feedback, adaptability, and maintaining a positive mindset.
“Don't be afraid to ask for help. As women we're so good at being the support that we forget how to say, ‘I can't do this…help me’. I had to learn that. When you go to a new country you're struggling with culture, traditions, currency, and setting up a home….it’s a lot. Ask for help,” Adowa says.
Lydia Wangari, founder Farmplace, expands agricultural exports and embraces community impact
Lydia Wangari says her company specialises in exporting avocados, mangoes, and macadamia nuts. Recently, it has ventured into value-added products such as macadamia and crude avocado oil.
Lydia's passion for agriculture stems from her upbringing in a family of coffee farmers in Kiambu, Kenya.
“We started the business initially with my father. I come from a family of coffee farmers and from where I come from there's a lot of avocados,” says Lydia.
Inspired by the high demand and prices for avocados in the US, where she worked in the nursing industry, Lydia decided to harness the potential of Kenya's rich agricultural landscape.
“Food is something that you can't live without and I mean, avocado is healthy, right? I have a passion for healthy eating. There's a lot of need for avocado in the world. People use avocados for a lot of things—for food, hair products, oil. Avocado oil is a very premium oil,” she says.
Market reach
Since its inception, Farmplace has expanded its market reach to the Middle East, the Far East, and Europe, exporting to countries like Italy and Germany. Plans are underway to penetrate the US market. Lydia attributes their success to attending trade fairs, understanding customer needs, and securing necessary certifications for the European market.
“You have to attend trade fairs. There's a lot of investment in marketing. You have to go outside there, listen to clients, and know their needs. You know, there's some trust when a customer puts a face to the person. And also, it's about, do you know what you're selling? Why are you it?” poses Lydia.
Lydia candidly discusses the challenges faced in the export business, including ensuring product quality and navigating complex payment terms. Initial financing came from her savings, which was later supplemented by support from Absa Bank. The company also benefits from upfront payments by customers, easing financial pressures.
“Financing is very crucial in exports. It's extremely, extremely expensive…I won't lie. But the returns are good.”
To ensure high-quality produce, Lydia emphasises the importance of groundwork and education. She works closely with small-scale farmers, particularly women, providing them with the necessary knowledge and resources to produce export-quality fruits.
“Avocado has a lot of pests. If you don't know, you can pack a lot of rejects. And then your customer sends you a report of how your product looks like. There's a lot of education and groundwork to be done. I engage myself with small-scale farmers, mostly women. Understanding what it is it they do, how it’s done, and identifying a group of farmers to work with. It’s not easy.
I've gone even for a whole year not exporting, just gaining information. My father used to the groundwork but after he passed on three years ago, I had to get out from desktop research and get the information from the ground. I had to pause, go around, learning from people who've done it. Some will share, some will not. There's also pricing, which is difficult. You need to ask somebody to hold your hand. And I can tell you for free, my banker tries to help me a lot.”
Diversification and Future Goals
Recognising the need for diversification, Farmplace Limited has started producing macadamia and avocado oil, which has a high demand locally and internationally. This move helps stabilise the company's income streams and fills gaps in the export market.
“New customers sometimes ask why should I trust you with my money? I use Absa to reach payment terms—we work on a bank-to-bank transaction. Whether the customer bank and my bank are the intermediaries. I release the documents to my bank, then their bank releases the money. But remember, some of our banks are not in their countries. That’s a major challenge that I am yet to unlock. That's why I've diversified to oil. Because the beauty with oil, I can also sell locally at a good price,” she says.
Lydia's future goals for the company include expanding production capacity, entering new international markets, and seeing Farmplace products on the shelves of major chain stores globally. She is also deeply committed to empowering women in her community, believing that supporting women can lead to broader community development.
Practical advice for aspiring exporters
“Groundwork. Networking. Financing,” Lydia says is the key hacking other markets. The company currently employs four permanent staff and outsources casuals according to their needs.
Lydia stresses the importance of having a clear purpose, investing in information, building strong relationships with banks and customers, and leveraging bank support. Attending trade fairs and seeking guidance from established exporters are also crucial steps. Hiring credible consultants can provide professional insights and aid in navigating the complex export landscape.
“You need information, even more than money. You need to know the prices. What’s the traceability of your fruits? You need to trace in case you get a quality report from your customer. You just don't pick fruit from anywhere. Not all fruits are export quality.
You need to know the licences required and the government bodies involved. To navigate, you can hire a consultant. Walk to the packhouses, and see what's done from A to Z,” she advises.
Lydia's vision is to create a sustainable business that not only thrives in the global market but also uplifts local communities. “I want to see our products on the shelves of major chain stores across the world,” she surmises.",2024-07-11
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/red-flag-as-youth-fund-bad-loans-hit-sh2-5bn-4686338,"The Youth Enterprise Fund (YEF) has accumulated Sh2.5 billion loans which have not been serviced for more than three years, signalling financial strains on the revolving fund created to help youth-owned enterprises access low-cost credit.
Defaulted repayments in revolving funds limit their functions because they limit the funds available for disbursement to the next borrower.
Auditor-General Nancy Gathungu said the Fund management did not explain the actions taken to recover the long outstanding amounts.
She also questioned Sh66,138,662 relating to loan repayments from unidentified borrowers, with some remaining unidentified for more than three years.
Ms Gathungu said the Fund’s management did not explain why reconciliations were not done to update and allocate borrowers accounts which could lead to the misstatement of receivables from the exchange transactions balance.
“In the circumstances, the accuracy and completeness of the receivables from exchange transactions balance of Sh66,138,662 could not be confirmed,” she said.
Further, the Auditor -General raised concerns over Sh180,363,789 which was held by a commercial bank and was irregularly paid to a company following the award of a supply contract.
She said this led to the conviction of the company and its directors for conspiracy to commit an economic crime, unlawful acquisition of public property, and falsifying documents.
“However, there was no evidence to indicate that the amount will be repaid to the Fund and therefore its recoverability is doubtful. In addition, no provision for bad and doubtful debts was made for this amount,” Ms Gathungu said.
“In the circumstances, the accuracy and completeness of the receivables from exchange transactions balance of Sh180,363,789 could not be confirmed.”
Ms Gathungu said the statement of financial position reflects an inventory balance of Sh36,600,500 which has been brought forward from the previous financial year.
She said the balance relates to automatic hatching machines that were procured during the financial year 2012/13.
The stocktake report for the period ended June 30, 2023, reflects that 853 and 52 pieces were being held at the National Youth Service (NYS) Ruaraka and NYS Mtongwe respectively, and they have been carried forward throughout the years without being disposed.
Further, Ms Gathungu noted that despite the inventories being slow-moving and likely to be impaired, no provision for impairment has been made.
She said in the circumstances, the accuracy and completeness of the inventory balance of Sh36,600,500 could not be confirmed.
Ms Gathungu drew the attention of management to note 24 to the financial statements which indicates that the Fund has been reporting losses over the past years.
During the year under review, the Fund had an improved performance, reporting a surplus of Sh5,168,982 compared to a deficit of Sh123,233,755 in the previous year.
Ms Gathungu said the poor performance over the last seven years has eroded the capital invested in the revolving Fund and impaired the ability of the Fund to discharge its mandate.
“This also casts significant doubt on the Fund’s ability to sustain its services in the foreseeable future,” she said.
Ms Gathungu said the statement of comparison budget and actual amounts reflect recurrent budget final and actual receipts on a comparable basis of Sh393,379,329 and Sh380,515,075 respectively resulting in an under-performance of Sh12,864,254 or 3 percent of the budget.
She said the Fund similarly spent Sh375,346,094 against an approved budget of Sh393,379,329 resulting in an under-expenditure of Sh18,033,235 or 5 percent of the budget.
“The underfunding and underexpenditure in recurrent vote affected the planned activities and may have impacted negatively on service delivery to the public,” Ms Gathungu said.",2024-07-10
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/opinion-analysis/columnists/navigating-flood-risks-with-effective-strategies-4686002,"In recent times, the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events have escalated, posing significant challenges across the globe.
In many regions, relentless rains have led to catastrophic flooding, disrupting lives and livelihoods. This indiscriminate nature’s fury always hit vulnerable communities hardest—particularly the urban poor and low-income groups who lack the resources to withstand or recover from these disasters.
Women, children, the elderly, and the disabled are disproportionately affected, facing greater difficulties in responding to and recovering from such calamities.
After the floodwaters recede, these communities face yet another challenge: the onset of the dry season. Areas now submerged under floods soon become dry, parched lands under the harsh sun.
A vicious cycle that not only signifies a shift in climate but also lays bare the damage left behind by the floods—ruined crops, lost livestock, and damaged agricultural infrastructure. However, it’s possible to mitigate these impacts through effective adaptation strategies and proper allocation of climate finance.
A crucial step in this process is the enhancement of early warning systems. Strengthening these systems can drastically reduce the impact of extreme weather by allowing timely preparations and evacuations, thereby safeguarding lives and property. The menace that the Maai Mahiu community is struggling to come to terms with is a sad reality, yet a sharp pointer to how early warning systems could save the day.
Additionally, investing in water management infrastructure, such as dams and reservoirs, is essential.
These facilities not only help control floods during rainy seasons but also maintain water supplies during droughts. The High Grand Falls Dam project, for example, is an excellent idea that has stalled for over a decade. Had it progressed, it might have alleviated the recurring floods affecting the Tana River communities.
Infrastructure resilience is another critical area requiring attention.
The recent flooding on the Nairobi Expressway, a structure less than two years old, collapsing of newly constructed apartment buildings among others underscores the need to ensure that new infrastructures can withstand such events. Overwhelmed drainage systems during these times reveal the urgent need for robust, climate-resilient building practices.
The cornerstone of all these efforts is funding. The Global Landscape of Climate Finance 2023 report by the Climate Policy Initiative reveals that a substantial portion of tracked climate finance—84 percent—is raised and spent domestically in most regions.
However, for sub-Saharan Africa, a significant amount—92 percent—of climate finance flows from international sources. Notably, this only represents a fraction of the global climate finance that cross borders, emphasising the need for increased financial inflows to the region.
Through these measures, Kenya can better navigate the complexities of climate-induced disasters and secure a more sustainable and resilient future for all its citizens.
Most of the global climate finance in 2021/2022 was through market-rate debt at 61 percent, which, while helpful, can exacerbate the already substantial debt burdens of developing countries like Kenya. It is imperative, therefore, that the government and other stakeholders explore alternative financing mechanisms that do not increase debt.
These could include leveraging public funds and concessional finance from multilateral development finance institutions (DFIs) and bilateral climate finance sources.
Creating blended finance facilities could also play a vital role in de-risking investments for private actors, encouraging them to invest in climate-related projects. This approach is essential for mobilizing the much-needed domestic funding necessary for substantial climate action.
Lastly, Kenya's potential as a carbon sink should be strategically utilised. The country's diverse ecosystems, such as forests, grasslands, and wetlands, offer significant opportunities for carbon sequestration.
With the carbon markets policy developed late last year and the regulations now nearing completion, tapping into carbon finance could provide critical support for building resilience for the country and local communities.",2024-07-10
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/kenya-s-domestic-debt-jumps-by-sh577-billion-in-a-year-4686374,"Public debt in the local market grew 5.8 percent during the fiscal year that ended last month with new borrowings hitting Sh577 billion, up from Sh545.2 billion acquired in a similar period the previous year.
Fresh data from the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) shows the new borrowing took the country’s domestic debt stock to Sh5.41 trillion as at the end of June 2024, up from Sh4.832 trillion at the end of June last year.
The Treasury had set the domestic borrowing target at Sh851.8 billion as of May, including Sh471.3 billion in net domestic borrowing and Sh380.5 billion in payments or redemptions.
The projection on new domestic borrowing has, however, been a moving target with the Treasury having first revised the target to Sh415.3 billion down from the original Sh587.4 billion projections in its September Budget Review and Outlook Paper (BROP).
The second 2023/24 supplementary estimates meanwhile set the target for net domestic borrowing further down to Sh407.0 billion.
The government was at the time seeking to implement an elaborate scheme to slash fresh debt by Sh273.7 billion.
The CBK, which is the government’s fiscal agent, had said that reduced borrowing in the domestic market would help ease pressures on interest rates.
The cut in local borrowing was further expected to help raise dollar inflows and slow down the weakening of the shilling due to a gaping mismatch between supply and demand for the international reserve currency.
In December, the Treasury again reviewed the domestic borrowing target to Sh471.4 billion on the back of lower-than-projected tax collections.
The heightened borrowing came despite the implementation of new and aggressive taxation measures contained in the Finance Act, 2023 which sought to narrow the country’s fiscal deficit during President Ruto’s first full financial year in office.
During the full year ended June, the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) collected Sh2.22 trillion in ordinary revenue marking a 9.5 percent jump from the Sh2.03 trillion netted in the fiscal year ended June 2023.
Despite the growth in both tax collections and net borrowings, the taxman missed its target by Sh267 billion on the back of reduced corporate profits and job cuts in a period when businesses were held down by the depreciation of the local currency as well as high energy prices.
Analysts have blamed the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for setting unrealistic tax targets for Kenya as part of its ongoing budgetary support programme.
Among the taxation shifts that the Dr Ruto-led regime oversaw during its first full fiscal year in office included enforcing the 16 percent value-added tax (VAT) on fuel, a reform that his predecessor Uhuru Kenyatta failed to fully implement in a decade.
Others included the introduction of 1.5 percent housing levy, increment of excise on mobile money transfers from 12 percent to 15 percent, introduction of a 15 percent excise duty on advertisements on various media platforms as well as introduction of new tax bands at 32.5 percent and 35 percent on monthly employment income above Sh500,000 and Sh800,000 respectively.
In an unprecedented move, Dr Ruto was last month forced to withdraw fresh taxation proposals contained in the Finance Bill 2024 in their entirety after rising public rage that threatened to shut down the economy.",2024-07-10
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/corporate/industry/how-diesel-cargo-sparked-fresh-kenya-uganda-fallout-4686402,"An undeclared consignment of 17,000 cubic metres of diesel shipped to Mombasa by Vitol Bahrain on behalf of Uganda triggered the latest standoff between Kampala and Nairobi, official correspondence show, with Kenya reacting by imposing a bond fee on the disputed cargo.
Documents obtained by the Business Daily show that Vitol imported 82,000 cubic metres of diesel under a direct fuel import deal with Kampala — higher than the 65,000 cubic metres that had been declared to Kenyan authorities by the Uganda National Oil Company (Unoc) and approved by the Energy and Petroleum Ministry in Nairobi.
The Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) initially rejected a request by Vitol Tank Terminal International Kenya (VTTI) to be allowed to offload the Ugandan cargo into its storage facility in Mombasa citing a breach of the conditions set by the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum.
VTTI General Manager Mark Musembi had in a letter requested KRA Commissioner for Customs and Border Control Lilian Nyawanda to allow the diesel cargo into its bonded customs transits warehouse and assess the size of the bond fee required on the consignment.
“We kindly request that the incoming cargo, approximately 82,000 cubic metres of gasoil (or any other higher volume permitted by the State Department of Petroleum), be received at the Terminal on arrival to avoid any delays,” he said in the July 2,2024 letter.
“This will help mitigate the additional cost of demurrage and ensure efficient use of the jetty. The volume received by the terminal above the volume currently assessed by KRA to be covered by the existing bond shall remain in the terminal pending completion of the two processes or as may be guided by KRA’s resident officer.”
The KRA, however, declined to grant Mr Musembi’s request, saying doing so would be a violation of the terms of the fuel import deal agreed between the two countries as well as the East Africa Community customs regulations.
“Your request to allow discharge of the 82,000 cubic metres of automotive gas oil (AGO) into your facility upon arrival of the vessel despite the limitations occasioned by insufficient bond is against the conditions given in the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum [in a letter] dated June 28, 2024, and is therefore rejected,” KRA acting Commissioner for Customs and Border Control, Kiprono Cole Bullut said in response to VTTI.
“Further, Section 62(1), (4), and (5) of the East Africa Community Customs Management Act 2004 as read together with Regulation 76 of the East Africa Community Customs Management Regulation 2010, which requires the bond in force to cover full the tax liability of any goods stored therein. The appropriate bond security, which would cover the tax liability of 82,000 cubic metres of AGO given the current tax rates, is approximately Sh4.428 billion.”
Mr Bullut further pointed out that VTTI must comply with bond terms because the taxman cannot overrule a pact between Uganda and the Kenyan Ministry of Energy and Petroleum.
“The conditions set out in the letter … from the Ministry cannot be set aside by the Commissioner Customs and Border Control and you are required to comply in full,” he said.
Authorities in Kampala were provoked by KRA’s stand, with Uganda’s minister for Energy and Mineral Resources, Ruth Nankabirwa, sensationally accusing Kenya of derailing its direct fuel import scheme through extra taxation.
“They (Kenya) have increased the bond fee at Vitol terminal where we are offloading our products and when you increase the bond fee to the tune of 40 million dollars, that means you are pushing Unoc to also increase and Ugandans are not likely to see reduced pump prices,” she said in a post on her X (formerly Twitter) handle.
The pronouncements by the Uganda official upset her Kenyan counterparts who were, however, advised against making retaliatory remarks that would further hurt diplomatic ties between the two neighbours.
Mrs Nankabirwa landed in Nairobi early this week to meet Kenyan Energy ministry officials over the issue in last-ditch efforts to avert a major diplomatic falling-out over her comments.
Sources said the meeting was yet to happen as at the time of going to press last evening. Unoc last week received the maiden fuel cargoes under a five-year deal that Uganda inked with Vitol Bahrain. Uganda opted for the deal a year after Kenya signed an agreement with Saudi Aramco, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, and Emirates National Oil Company for the supply of fuel on credit for 180 days.
The neighbouring country had said that the deal with Vitol Bahrain would help lower pump prices, a promise that has been shattered by unexplained charges that will make fuel in Kampala more expensive than in Nairobi.",2024-07-10
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/corporate/companies/krc-boss-faces-jail-term-over-kisumu-house-demolitions-4686282,"Kenya Railways Corporation managing director Philip Mainga risks jail for refusing to compensate residents of a village in Kisumu whose houses the corporation demolished three years ago.
Environment and Land Court judge Samson Okong’o directed Mr Mainga to appear before the court on July 25 and show cause why he should not be jailed for failing to pay the residents of Shauri Moyo and Swahili villages in Muhoroni, Kisumu.
The court had, on March 14, 2024, directed Kenya Railways Corporation to pay the 206 residents Sh20.6 million for demolishing their houses in February 2021.
“That the managing director of the Kenya Railways Corporation, Philip J. Mainga, shall appear in court on 25/7/2024 to show cause why he should not be committed to civil jail for disobedience of the order made by this court on 14/3/2024,” said Justice Okong’o.
The residents, led by Solomon Musa, successfully sued the government and Kenya Railways for demolishing their houses on February 6, 2021.
Justice Anthony Ombwayo ruled that their right to housing was violated as their dwellings were demolished without considering their welfare.
The judge said that by destroying their houses, churches, and schools, the corporation denied the residents socio-economic and cultural rights as provided for in the Constitution.
Through lawyer Kenneth Amondi, the residents accused the corporation of not consulting or issuing them notices before flattening their houses.
Kenya Railways defended the demolitions, arguing that they were done lawfully and after the notices were served to the residents. The court was informed that KR wanted to reclaim all railway operational areas encroached on.
Further, the corporation said notices were issued requiring the residents to vacate its land to pave the way for the impending demolitions of all illegal structures built on the railway reserve.
But Justice Ombwayo ruled that evictions should not result in individuals being rendered homeless or vulnerable to the violation of other human rights.
“Where those affected were unable to provide for themselves, the State party had to take all appropriate measures, to the maximum of its available resources, to ensure that adequate alternative housing, resettlement or access to productive land, as the case could be, was available,” the judge said.
The judge held that no consultations were done as the evictions were unlawful and no Relocation Action Plan was made to ensure that the residents of Shauri Moyo, Bondeni, and Swahili villages were resettled or compensated before the evictions were done.
The court directed that each resident be paid Sh100,000 as compensation.",2024-07-10
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/corporate/companies/safaricom-cuts-ceo-annual-bonus-by-sh62-million-4686388,"Safaricom chief executive officer Peter Ndegwa’s annual performance bonus fell by Sh62.2 million in the year to March 2024, marking the first time his pay has dropped since he was appointed in April 2020.
Disclosures in Safaricom’s annual report for the 12 months ending March 2024 show that the company paid Mr Ndegwa a bonus of Sh134.1 million in the period, compared to Sh196.3 million in the year to March 2023. The bonus had risen from Sh90 million in March 2021 to Sh178.9 million in March 2022.
The fall in the bonus saw Mr Ndegwa’s total pay for the year to March 2024 decline to Sh252.3 million from Sh313.1 million a year earlier.
Safaricom said in its latest annual report that executive directors — Mr Ndegwa and the chief finance officer Dilip Pal — are remunerated as per their negotiated employment contracts and are employed on a permanent basis, but does not give a breakdown of the performance parameters used in setting their annual bonus.
“Besides the basic salary, the executive director is entitled to an annual performance-based bonus and shares, residential accommodation, utility bills payment and club membership,” the company said in its 2024 annual report.
Safaricom told the Business Daily to stick to what is in the report when contacted for comment.
Listed companies normally include a number of short- and long-term incentives for executives, based on business performance parameters such as profitability, growth of cash generated by the business, the performance of the company’s share at the stock market, shareholder returns such as dividends and development of new revenue lines.
In the year to March, Safaricom’s consolidated net profit rose marginally to Sh62.99 billion from Sh62.26 billion, with its share of losses from its recently established Ethiopian subsidiary weighing down growth in the Kenyan unit.
Safaricom Kenya’s net profit grew by 13.7 percent in the period to Sh84.74 billion, while Safaricom Ethiopia posted a Sh42.09 billion net loss.
Safaricom owns 51.67 percent of the Ethiopia unit, meaning that the share of the losses booked on its financial report stood at Sh21.7 billion.
The company kept its total dividend for the year unchanged at Sh1.20 per share, amounting to a total payout of Sh48.08 billion. The dividend was split into an interim payout of Sh0.55 per share — paid out in March — and a final dividend of Sh0.65 per share, which will be paid out on August 31 to shareholders on the register as of July 31.
In terms of share price performance, the telco’s stock saw a 1.9 percent decline in the reporting period — standing at Sh17.55 per share at the end of March 2024 compared to Sh18.10 a year earlier. In addition to straight cash bonuses, the company also offers its staff a share-based reward scheme.
Under Safaricom’s employee performance share award plan, the company buys its own shares in the open market and allocates them to specific employees, who take ownership after a three-year vesting period when they are free to sell or continue holding the stock in their personal accounts.
In the year to March 2024, Safaricom rewarded senior managers with 17.5 million shares worth Sh302.75 million under the performance award scheme. The beneficiaries had received 15.3 million shares the previous year.
The company also bought an additional 10 million shares in the year to March 2024 for future awards, at a cost of Sh164.3 million.
The free shares and Safaricom’s long-term stock price gains in recent years have made the company’s stock-based compensation one of the more lucrative among the country’s publicly-traded firms.
The beneficiaries who continue to hold their shares after vesting also benefit from dividends paid out annually by the company, whose payout policy normally sees it distribute about 80 percent of its net profits every year to shareholders.
Stock-based compensation, which comes with a vesting period, helps a company retain high-performing staff, in the process improving its prospects for continued profitability.",2024-07-11
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/corporate/companies/simba-corp-enters-ev-trade-with-kenya-power-deal-4686108,"Simba Corp has entered the nascent electric vehicle (EV) market, seeking to progressively offer passenger cars and commercial units over the years as the country transitions from vehicles powered by diesel and petrol.
The company recently sold two units of all-electric Mahindra XUV 400 sports utility vehicle (SUV) to Kenya Power at a cost of Sh9 million each.
The dealer is set to deliver four more similar units to the electricity distributor later this year.
The company has been selling petrol and diesel-powered passenger cars and commercial vehicles, holding the local franchises for global automakers Mitsubishi, Mahindra and Proton. Mr Kotecha said Simba’s expansion will include bringing in electric versions of some of the existing internal combustion engine (ICE) models.
“Several brands that we represent in Kenya are preparing to introduce EV solutions, spanning from passenger vehicles to commercial vehicles,” he said.
“Some of these may belong to the same product category, while others may differ slightly. For example, we are working on offering EV Canters from Fuso and the EV Phoenix (equivalent to ICE models) from Ashok Leyland.”
The parent firms of Simba Corp’s main rivals –Isuzu East Africa and CFAO Kenya— are meanwhile investing heavily in hydrogen technology that they see as a contender in the clean energy race.
Mr Kotecha saunch of new products depends on favourable government policies, market demand and the speed at which the charging infrastructure is developing in the country.
The electric Mahindra SUVs that Kenya Power is buying from Simba Corp are part of the utility firm’s strategy to gain insights in the electric vehicle market and develop charging infrastructure to support it.
Kenya Power announced in April that it will invest Sh258 million over three years to buy electric vehicles and build charging stations, having built such a facility at its headquarters in Parklands, Nairobi.
Mr Kotecha said Simba Corp is also investing in its property and equipment in readiness for a scaled-up electric vehicle sales and support business.
“We continue making investments in our assembly plant, Associated Vehicle Assemblers (AVA) and in our primary workshops to establish infrastructure capable of safely handling EV unit batteries, diagnostic equipment, personal protective equipment kits, and other necessary tooling,” he said.
Globally, the showroom prices of more models of electric vehicles are falling below that of comparable diesel or petrol-powered units, gradually eroding the cost advantage that traditional cars have held.
Mr Kotecha said that traditional periodic oil change services will become obsolete, and warranty periods will notably extend, especially for the battery which is the core component of an electric vehicle.",2024-07-10

Sponsored by Exness
Fueled by aggressive marketing tactics from unlicensed brokers, the allure of trading has swept across Kenya's burgeoning financial landscape, painting a deceptive picture for aspiring traders with false promises.
These brokers perpetuate dangerous myths: You can get rich quickly, trading is an exclusive professional club, and large sums of money are required to start. These misconceptions overshadow the dedication, knowledge, and resilience needed to be a consistent trader.
To empower Kenyan investors to make informed decisions, it's crucial to dispel the myths and illuminate the realities of trading.
Myth: Trading is the path to instant wealth Fact: Profits and losses are all part of the trading experience
While tales of astronomical trading success abound, they are rarely an overnight phenomenon and definitely not the rule. Sustainability in trading requires more than luck; it demands continuous learning, practice, and a healthy dose of realism.
Terence Hove, Exness Senior Financial Market Strategist, cuts through the hype, “Trading isn’t a golden ticket to make you rich. It’s a skill honed through education, discipline, and emotional control. Losses are inevitable – the key is to minimise them while maximising gains.”
Trading is a craft that takes time and effort to master, and education is paramount. By learning about market analysis, technical indicators, and risk management strategies, setting realistic goals, developing a sound strategy, and practicing discipline, traders can increase their chances of consistency in trading.
Myth: You can only start trading with a large amount of capital Fact: Trading doesn't require large amounts of money to get started
Gone are the days when trading was just for an exclusive club of wealthy people and institutions. The democratisation of financial markets, fueled by micro-investing and fintech innovation, has opened the doors to anyone with a modest capital base and a thirst for knowledge.
Exness’ Howard explains, “Technology has revolutionised trading. Today, you can start trading micro-lots, allowing you to participate in the market without risking large sums of money.”
Of course, this increased accessibility has been amplified by the proliferation of online trading platforms and mobile apps, which empower Kenyans to access global markets from anywhere.
Myth: Only professionals can trade Fact: With online education, you can master the art of trading
The belief that trading is solely for seasoned professionals is outdated. Hove asserts, “With the abundance of educational resources available today, anyone can learn to trade confidently and consistently. The key is understanding market dynamics, anticipating fluctuations, and developing a sound strategy.”
Now, more than ever, aspiring traders can access reliable sources to learn everything about the financial markets and remain up-to-date. Even experienced traders benefit from continuous learning, staying abreast of fundamental news, and using technical analysis to refine their strategies. As such, the notion that trading is reserved for seasoned traders is simply outdated.
Empowering Kenyan traders
The trading boom in Kenya presents a unique opportunity for financial growth, but it's essential to approach it with eyes wide open. By debunking these prevalent myths, aspiring traders can make informed decisions, manage risk effectively, and embark on a path toward sustainable profitability. Remember, trading is a marathon, not a sprint. With dedication, education, and a realistic mindset, the potential for success is within reach.",2024-07-10
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/corporate/enterprise/-ways-to-enhance-good-governance-as-a-sole-proprietor-4686076,"Sole proprietorships are a common business association in Kenya. They have several advantages over other forms of business as they are easy to incorporate and decision-making is quick. While the business owner is mostly the sole decision maker, the disadvantage is that he bears the risks alone.
One of the biggest risks he or she faces is the lack of good governance structures that promote transparency and accountability due to the business being owned and managed by the same person. There may also be a lack of proper systems.
Essentially, good governance practices require a separation of ownership and management. They also need a high level of transparency and accountability and this calls for putting in place systems that separate ownership and management. Good governance is crucial for the growth and longevity of a business.
First, the business owner can have in place an advisory board. This is a team of external experts who assist the sole proprietor in making sound decisions. The advisory board helps in upholding accountability and transparency. In such an arrangement, the sole proprietor is accountable to the external board. The board also helps in decision-making.
When choosing an advisory board, the sole proprietor ought to ensure that it is multi-skilled so that he or she accesses expert advice in different sectors. It is advisable to recruit board members who have prior board experience. The sole proprietor can fix the remuneration of board members to motivate them.
Secondly, enhancing sound governance practices can be achieved by having in place board and staff committees. These committees have the mandate of handling certain key aspects of the business such as finance, human resources, and business development among others. The benefit of committees is that they help spread the risk in decision-making.
Through board and staff committees, a sole proprietor gets access to expert insights. Like the case with the advisory board, he or she ought to carefully choose committee members to ensure they are experts and can add value to decision-making.
Thirdly, a sole proprietorship can enhance good governance by adopting organisational policies that govern various aspects of the business. Organisational policies are recommended for all types of businesses as they give policy direction on how the business is managed and run.
To support the organisational policies, the sole proprietorship ought to put in place systems and processes to govern how the business will be operated. Systems and processes are important in streamlining business operations and enhancing efficiency.
The systems and processes also ensure the business does not depend on the sole proprietor but can develop its own life.
Having systems and processes will free the sole proprietor from participating in the day-to-day operations of the business and instead focus on growth and wealth creation.
Business continuity and succession planning are other important aspects that the sole proprietor should consider to ensure that the business continues to run and has longevity.",2024-07-10
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/corporate/companies/inadequate-funding-poor-infrastructure-hurt-kenya-s-startups-4685244,"Limited access to funding, as well as inadequate infrastructure, are among the key factors holding down the takeoff of Kenya’s startup ecosystem, a new survey shows.
The latest ""Global Startup Ecosystem Index Report, 2024"" published by sector research centre StartupBlink indicates that most startups in Kenya also cited lack of mentorship for poor performance.
Last year, Kenya dropped one spot to 63rd globally in the rank of startup-friendly destinations while retaining its third place in Africa, at a time Mombasa dropped off from the world’s top 1,000 preferred cities for startup investments.
During the same period, however, Nairobi improved, climbing 24 places to position 113 globally up from 137th last year, while Kisumu made its debut appearance to the global top 1,000 list, after it took the 985th position.
Despite the budding challenges, the report has recognised Kenya as a significant innovative tech hub that’s chiefly buoyed by novel solutions such as Safaricom’s mobile money platform M-Pesa.
“Kenya’s pioneering status as a leading continental ecosystem is even more impressive considering the relatively low population compared to countries such as Nigeria,” StartupBlink said in its new report. “With access to a mature economy and a growing culture of entrepreneurship, Kenya offers a strong English-speaking point of access to the African market.”
Other strengths of the Kenyan ecosystem, according to the report, include the extensive involvement of the public sector (read government) with the key highlight being the development of the Konza Technopolis tech hub in Machakos County.
“Besides public sector efforts, Nairobi is home to regional offices of global tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Samsung, and Intel, which makes the city attractive to tech startups. Also, the presence of accelerators like Antler and Pangea Accelerator contributes to the startup culture,” reads the report.",2024-07-09
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/corporate/companies/kenya-power-fails-to-block-firm-s-claim-for-fire-losses-4686296,"The court also ruled that it did not think it was the responsibility of Pwani Warehousing Ltd to ensure that the cutout fuses from the main supply line to the godown remained connected at all times. “It was not proved that it was out of the negligence of the respondent that the cutout fuses were dismantled to isolate the godown,” ruled Justice Majanja.
In its appeal, Kenya Power had wanted the High Court to determine whether the magistrate’s court misapprehended the evidence and arrived at the wrong conclusion and also whether it proceeded on wrong principles and came to an erroneous decision.
Justice Majanja noted that a report by the chief fire officer in Mombasa County indicated that the cutout fuses had been dismantled to isolate supply in the godown.
“This would explain why neighbouring areas on the same supply line would not be affected by a power surge from the main supply line,” said Justice Majanja.
At the magistrate’s court, Pwani Warehousing Limited had said that on June 12, 2018, a fire broke out at a warehouse that it had leased to Portside Freight Terminals.
The company told the court that security guards on duty put out a distress call to the fire department of the county government of Mombasa who responded with alacrity and with the help of the port fire brigade, extinguished it.
The court further heard that the chief fire officer at the county government of Mombasa wrote a report covering the fire incident which attributed the cause of the fire to an electrical short circuit on electrical wiring in the internal distribution caused by excess power.
Kenya Power had opposed the case because it claimed that the fire was caused by a short circuit in the company's internal distribution system hence it was beyond its jurisdiction.
The electricity distributor argued that it could only be held responsible for fires caused due to faults on the main power line.",2024-07-10
https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/opinion-analysis/columnists/kenya-s-path-to-fiscal-stability-after-rating-downgrade-4686016,"The recent downgrade of Kenya’s credit rating by Moody’s from B3 (Highly Speculative) to Caa1 (Substantial Risk) signals a critical juncture for fiscal and economic policies.
This development, triggered by Gen Z protests and concerns over the Finance Bill 2024, underscores the delicate balance between government revenue needs and citizens’ willingness to contribute.
At its core, this downgrade carries profound implications for Kenya’s economic future. In the realm of international finance, such moves typically herald higher borrowing costs as lenders demand greater compensation for increased risk.
For Kenya, this could initiate a troubling cycle: elevated interest payments on debt may siphon funds from vital public services and investments, potentially stifling economic growth and further straining public finances.
The crux of Moody’s decision lies in the anticipated reduction of tax revenues, which could impair Kenya’s ability to service its debt.
This predicament illuminates a fundamental economic challenge: how to reconcile the government’s fiscal requirements with the capacity and willingness of its citizens to pay taxes.
In response to this crisis, a multifaceted approach touching on key economic principles needs to be devised. Some economic policy experts have suggested of radical spending cuts, while appealing to fiscal hawks.
This raises concerns and caution against drastic reductions during economic downturns must be carefully implemented. Such measures risk deepening recessions by suppressing aggregate demand. However, targeted cuts in areas of inefficiency could yield benefits without severe economic repercussions. Equally crucial is the need to show value for taxes paid.
This concept taps into the economic notion of the “social contract” between citizens and the state. When individuals perceive adequate returns on their tax contributions through public services, they are more likely to view taxation as legitimate and comply with tax laws.
The current situation in Kenya, with citizens resorting to private solutions for basic services, suggests a breakdown in this social contract leading to what economists term a “low-level equilibrium trap,” where poor public services diminish the willingness to pay taxes, perpetuating a cycle of inadequate funding and subpar services.
Kenya’s path forward calls for more than mere policy adjustments—it necessitates a fundamental reimagining of the relationship between the government and its citizens.
Building a more trusted government touches on the economic concept of “credible commitment.”
Administrations that can reliably fulfil policy promises and demonstrate competence are more likely to gain public trust and support for their economic agenda. This, in turn, can attract increased domestic and foreign investment, fostering a more stable economic environment.
From a long-term perspective, Kenya’s situation exemplifies the complex interplay between governance, public finance, and economic growth. These challenges, while not unique to Kenya, are common in many developing economies. The emphasis on the importance of building strong institutions, fostering human capital, and creating an environment conducive to private sector growth as key drivers of sustainable economic development, cannot be gainsaid.
However, it’s crucial to recognize that economic transformations require time and persistence. Quick fixes are rare in economic policy, and sustainable changes often demand consistent effort over years or even decades.
With thoughtful reforms and a steadfast commitment to rebuilding trust, Kenya has the potential to emerge stronger, charting a course toward sustainable economic growth and stability.",2024-07-10

They flew from abroad and organised a relaunch of a book she wrote 49 years ago.
According to Hana Njau-Okolo, who lives in Atlanta, Georgia, there has been renewed interest in Ripples in the Pool, a book that was first published in 1975.
""An editor reached out to me enquiring whether they could acquire rights to publish the book,"" says Hana. ""Luckily, my mother has her documents in order and the new edition finally came out this year.""
Though it has been out of mass circulation for a number of years, Ripples in the Pool is a recommended text in many universities around the world.
""The book was studied in the Black and Puerto Rican Department, when I was in university, in the US, a thing that earned me lots of friends,"" adds Hana.
When the book finally came out, Hana and her elder brother, Morille Njau, who lives in the UK, decided to make the unveiling a special treat for their mother.
Hana, who is an events organiser in the US, reached out to the Literature Department of the University of Nairobi, who were too willing to take up the event that took place at the Multimedia library of the Alliance Française.
To underscore how seriously they took the assignment, the department, led by its chair, Prof Miriam Musonye, had the traveling theatre of the university to enact certain parts of the book.
""My mother was besides herself with joy; she was so excited, she could not stop talking about the launch days after,"" says Hana.
Ripples in the Pool covers the period immediately after Kenya's independence and how Africans were coping with the new dispensation, having emerged out of the harsh colonialism period, where most of them, had their lands dispossessed.
It is in this reality that Selina, one of the major protagonists in the book, emerges. As a single woman working as a nurse in Nairobi, Selina seeks the good life. To augment her earnings, she moonlights as a fashion model as well as a 'man pleaser'.
Rebeka is a woman of many firsts. She was the founding principal of Moi Girls, Nairobi, a national school.
“I am thrilled to bits to have been able to attend our Mother’s book launch. She continues to be such a great role model for me throughout my life,” says Rebeka’s son Morille. “I hope that I can achieve even half of what she has achieved at 91 years of age.”
Rebeka had been among the pioneering students of Alliance Girls High School.
Rebeka worked as a communications coordinator for the National Council of Churches of Kenya.
Even at 91, Rebeka Njau is not about to retire her famous pen. Hana revealed that she is currently working on her newest book.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/us-embassy-in-nairobi-to-be-closed-tomorrow-n345143,"U.S Embassy in Nairobi to be closed on Thursday
The United States government has
announced that its embassy premises in Nairobi will be closed on Thursday, July 4, 2024.
The embassy, in a public statement released on Wednesday, said the closure will be in accordance with the U.S Independence Day which is usually marked every fourth of July.
What’s
the origin of Independence Day?
On
July 4, the United States celebrates the anniversary of its existence. It is a
commemoration of the day in 1776 when representatives of the 13 British
colonies signed the Declaration of Independence, a separation from Great
Britain.
The
decision to break ties with the English monarchy was years in the making, and
ultimately stemmed from two seemingly unrelated but intertwined causes.
The
first was a long-term drive by the English Government to impose ever-tighter
control over the colonists. Second was the imposition of taxes on the colonists
as a means to discharge the huge debts of the English Crown, many of them
accrued as a result of the 1754 French and Indian war: a continuation of
England’s centuries-long, on-again, off-again war with France.
Beginning
in 1764, the English Parliament began to impose taxes specifically intended to
raise money from the colonials for the Crown, first on sugar, and then on an
ever-growing list of goods including newspapers, glass, legal documents, paint,
and tea. The imposition of each new tax was met with organized protest.
Eventually
the taxes became punitive, the protests more violent, and government response
increasingly more restrictive. The situation was particularly acrimonious in
Boston.
The
final straw came in February 1775, when the British Parliament shut down Boston
harbor. Boston began to prepare for war. Thus, although the American
Revolutionary War did not officially begin until July 4, 1776, the first battle
was fought just west of Boston on April 19, 1775.
In
the Revolution’s aftermath, the leaders of the fledgling United States
remembered the abuses of British rule. Governed by the liberal ideals of the
Enlightenment, they turned the conventional relationship between the government
and the governed on its head.
The
top-down government headed by a hereditary ruling class was replaced by the
principle of elected national and state executives. Common citizens played
increasingly important roles in local and state governance, and as more people
gained the right to vote, political participation increased. Within a decade,
this idea galvanized democratic and independence movements around the globe.
As
Thomas Jefferson, later the third President of the United States, wrote in the
Declaration of Independence to justify the American colonies’ decision to break
away from Britain, “When a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing
invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute
Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government.”

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/adak-sports-journalists-key-in-fight-against-doping-n345286,"ADAK: Sports journalists key in fight against doping
Journalists have a critical role to play in the fight against
doping as Kenya battles to be expunged from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)
Category A list of countries at the greatest risk of the scourge.
Speaking at a workshop organized for Sports Journalists
Association of Kenya (SJAK) members in Naivasha, Nakuru County, Anti-Doping
Agency of Kenya (ADAK) Chief Executive, Sarah Shibutse, through Head of
Anti-Doping Education and Research Martin Sisa, noted that increased testing
was unmasking more dope cheats than ever before.
It comes after ADAK recorded its highest ever annual testing
figures of 4,135 athletes in the past year, with the organization targeting to
increase the number to 6,000 in the next 12 months.
“In Kenya, where athletics is a significant source of national
pride and international recognition, the role of journalists is particularly
critical. By shining a light on doping practices and advocating for clean
sports, they help to protect the integrity of Kenyan athletics and inspire
future generations of athletes.”
“Journalists play a crucial role in the fight against doping in
Kenya through various means. Their contributions are essential in creating
awareness, promoting transparency, and holding stakeholders accountable,” the
CEO emphasized.
Shibutshe noted that Kenya is a signatory to the 2005 UNESCO
Convention Against Doping in Sports guided by Article 5, of the Convention.
Article 5 states that “In abiding by the obligation contained in
this convention, each state Party undertakes to adopt appropriate measures.
Such measures may include legislation, regulation, policies or administrative
practices.”
The CEO explained: “Since the last year’s clean sport workshop
for SJAK, the media has been reporting on the high level of doping cases among
Kenyan athletes. I am happy to report that the Agency has seen a tremendous
improvement in the way doping cases are reported in Kenya. ADAK encourages
Journalists to continue supporting this fight against doping.”
Shibutse added that journalists contribute immensely to the
fight by exposing doping scandals through investigative journalism and by
uncovering doping practices, often bringing hidden issues to light.
“By exposing these scandals, they can prompt action from sports
authorities and the government. Through articles, interviews, and

play in sports.
“Journalists can advocate for stronger anti-doping measures and policies through opinion pieces, editorials, and partnerships with advocacy groups. By reporting on successful doping control measures and clean athletes, journalists help to reinforce positive behaviors and role models in sports,” Shibutse expounded.

In Bondeni Estate, one of the informal
settlements in Nakuru East lives the family of Caroline Chepkoech.
It’s Sunday morning and Chepkoech is
attending to her son who was shot 11 times during the June 27 protests
against the Finance Bill, as police fired rubber bullets to disperse
protesters.
Chepkoech is taking a keen look at her
son's injuries lodged in the back, as ordered by doctors, five days after he
was discharged from hospital.
“Hapa tumefika ana maumivu usiku anaanza
kuita ghai…namwambia avumilie kwenye mungu amemtoa ni mbali.dawa alikuwa
anatumia zimeisha, dressing baada ya siku moja juu hizo dawa ni fresh,” she
says.
His was a case of being at the wrong place at the wrong time, as he was in town to collect an asthma inhaler for his
ailing mum when the protests turned violent.
“Niliamka kwenda tao kutafutia mama
dawa,kutafuta dawa nikaona gari imekuja wakatutupia teargas nikalala chini
wakapata njia ya kunipiga risasi……waliponishoot aliniambia niamke niende
nyumbani,” says the 14-year-old.
The events of 27th June have left this
family in distress.
The boy now requires Ksh.300 daily to have
the wounds dressed and medication to ease the pain, funds that this family does
not have.
“Ningeomba kama kuna uwezo asaidiwe
kwasababu yeye ni mwanafunzi na hatuna uwezo,” Chepkoech says.
On 27th June, the 14-year-old boy was
caught up in the crossfire when police engaged protesters in running battles in
Nakuru.
The family is hoping that well-wishers will
come through for them as the government pledged support to the families of
victims shot during the protests.

After the pause on street protests, an
influential figure on X has shifted his focus to Kenyan churches in a bid to
rid them of leaders and politicians in a campaign dubbed #CleanTheAltar.
Mwambili Mwagodi, a hotel expert based in
Mombasa, has kicked off the campaign which has seen him directly text or call
church pastors and bishops and personally urge them to disinvite Kenyan
politicians - including the President - from their functions.
Before the blitz, Mwagodi memorably traveled
to Nyahururu from Mombasa in a bid to lead the Nyahururu Gen Zers in a protest
against President William Ruto.
As Ruto was addressing the faithful at the ACK
Nyahururu Diocese Church in Nyahururu, Laikipia County, the venue of a
consecration ceremony and enthronement
of Rev. Maj. Samson Mburu Gachathi as the 3rd Bishop of ACK Nyahururu Diocese,
Mwambili led youthful protesters in chanting anti-Finance Bill 2024 slogans outside
the venue after being denied access to the church service.
Undetterred by the intimidating presence of the Anti-Terror Police Unit, Mwagodi charged on, leading the protesters in fervent
chants, causing a commotion outside the venue and even seeing President Ruto
flee the area hurriedly and without addressing the locals.
Now, the hotelier-turned-activist has shifted
his focus to online activism, gathering contacts belonging to various church
leaders and directly warning them of entertaining politicians on their altars.
On Thursday night, he texted Reverend Simon
Mutahi warning him of allowing First Lady Racheal Ruto on his altar, telling
him, ""I see you have invited Mrs. Rachel Ruto to your church for a
fundraiser. First of all, the money is looted from the taxes I pay
to this government of looters.""
""The message is to notify you that we are
coming for the fundraiser. God bless you"".
Not too long after, Rev. Mutahi replied,
""Good Evening Mwabili. Thank you for reaching out. Please note that the
First Lady will not be attending the fundraiser. You are welcome to worship
with us. Blessed night.""
After further questioning, the man of God
replied, ""Please can you help me post the current position that the First
Lady will (not) be attending? This was something planned long ago but has since
changed.""
Satisfied with the response, Mwagodi took to
his X account to announce the results of his activism, winning plaudits from
thousands of Kenyans.
""REVEREND MUTAHI has clarified that Mrs. Rachel Ruto shall not be attending the Lavington United Church Fundraiser for the new Sanctuary on Sunday, 30 June. Praise Jesus!"" he wrote.
Soon after, he hunted down the contacts of Father William Kamau of Kaharati Catholic Church who invited Deputy
President Rigathi Gachagua to his church for a fundraiser on Sunday.
He texted him: ""As Kenyans, we have
decided to start a campaign to kick out politicians from the Church pulpit
where they come to spread lies and insults and donate money which we are very
sure is a product of looting of our taxes.""
""This message is to notify you that we
request you to cancel his invitation and if this is not possible then the
Congregation on Sunday will not allow him to speak on the pulpit or donate
these ill-gotten funds to the Church of Christ Jesus our Lord and Savior.""
Mwagodi went on to reveal that Father Kamau
had told him that people like Rigathi Gachagua 'have businesses where they get
money to donate to the church'.
Unshaken, he has now embarked on finding the
phone numbers belonging to various other churches including that of the
Deliverance Church, Kaplong, ACK St. Faith Ongata Rongai and Eldoret's Bishop
John Kiprono Lelei.
Pleased by his work, one Kenyan wrote,
""Whatever @mwabilimwagodi is doing to #CleanTheAltar is worth supporting.
Share posters of those fundraisers that the church has invited politicians and
their representatives. Tutamsalimia Bishop na tuitishe invite pia. 2 of them
have cancelled already!""
Someone else wrote, ""Mwabili is not
infringing the right of association. He is simply following the example that
Christ gave when he cleansed the Temple from traders. The church is not a hotel
for saints and the moneyed! If Jesus beat them up, why not Mwagodi?""
And while reacting to criticism thrown
Mwagodi's way, one Kenyan defended his actions, saying, ""Mwabili is not
going for the 'harmless believers'. He is gunning for the lying thieving murdering
politicians who flaunt & use their ill-gotten gains in church, in cahoots
with the clergy, to sanitise their image. These are the wolves in sheep's
clothing that Christ warned you of.""

Speaking in Nyeri town, the Deputy President lauded the young people for seeking to have a conversation with the President virtually, adding that this marked a turning point in public engagement towards good governance.
""The young people did well to speak and this a new beginning for our country- that everybody matters. Every Kenyan has something to contribute to the wellbeing of our nation, including the young people. In fact, they know more than we do. They have the knowledge we have the experience,"" he said.
President Ruto on Friday afternoon engaged youthful Generation Z in a live audio discussion on X Spaces, where he answered questions from the participants.
""What the President did yesterday (Friday) was a good beginning. It was a very healthy conversation, I listened in and it was very good,"" said Gachagua.
He spoke during a graduation thanksgiving service of Governor Mutahi Kahiga's daughter Grace Wangechi.
The Deputy President asked political leaders to emulate the Head of State and engage the people more.
""Let us listen to the people,"" he told leaders as he rallied Kenyans to support the Head of State in his mission to turn-around and rebuild the country's economy.
He further asked political leaders to avoid talking down on people and bravado.
The Deputy President, in addition, condemned destruction of public and private property during the recent protests, which started peacefully before infiltration by criminals.
The Deputy President was accompanied by his Spouse Pastor Dorcas and various political leaders including Governors Joshua Irungu (Laikipia) and Kiarie Badilisha (Nyandarua), Nyeri Deputy Governor David Kinaniri, Naivasha MP Jayne Kihara, MCAs led by Nyeri Speaker Gichuhi Mwangi, Clergy and the Community leaders among others.

Two-time defending world champion Kalle Rovanpera completed a remarkable week by sealing victory at Rally Poland on Sunday, the seventh of 13 rounds of the World Rally Championship.
The 23-year-old Finn was only drafted in on Tuesday to take part in the rally when Toyota teammate Sebastien Ogier had an accident during a reconnaissance run.
The eight-time world champion and his co-driver Vincent Landais, who was involved in a head-on collision, were uninjured, as were the two occupants of the other vehicle involved.
The 'super sub' Rovanpera responded, however, with a superb drive, winning eight of the 19 stages around Mikolajiki in the north-east of the country, and charging to his 13th career victory.
""It’s been quite an amazing week,"" smiled Rovanpera.
“Definitely I have to say we have been working quite hard and we are really tired now. I think the best thing is we came here, and it was not a bad idea to come.
""We helped the team a lot and took a lot of points for the manufacturers’ championship, so we didn’t waste our time.""
Toyota made it a 1-2 with Welshman Elfyn Evans finishing second, 28.3 seconds behind, with M-Sport Ford's Adrien Fourmaux completing the podium.
Second on Sunday morning, just a handful of seconds behind Rovanpera, Norway's Andreas Mikkelsen (Hyundai) lost any chance of victory when he suffered a puncture on the 16th stage.
""It was sad what happened today,"" said the Norwegian who nursed his car through to the finish.
“We were really unlucky. The right thing to do (after the puncture) was to bring the car back for the team.”
The Korean team continues to lead the drivers' championship through Thierry Neuville, fourth in Poland, on 136 points, 15 ahead of Evans who has leapfrogged the other Hyundai driver Ott Tänak who is a further six points back.
Thanks to the victory of its five-star replacement, Toyota are still in a position to retain its two world titles - driver and manufacturer - as the halfway point of the season approaches.
The next round of the WRC will be held in Latvia from July 18-21.
Final standings at Rally Poland
1. Kalle Rovanpera/Jonne Halttunen (FIN/Toyota) 2hrs 33min 07.06sec, 2. Elfyn Evans/Scott Martin (GBR/Toyota) at 28.3sec, 3. Adrien Fourmaux/Alexandre Coria (FRA/M-Sport Ford) 42.7, 4. Thierry Neuville/Martin Wydaeghe (BEL/Hyundai) 1:10.8, 5. Martins Sesks/Renars Francis (LVA/Ford) 1:47.0

In an exclusive interview with digital journalists at State House on Sunday evening, Ruto was asked if he would join X Spaces to engage the disgruntled youth, the majority of who are Generation Z.
""In the next one week, we must have this conversation in the space where you want. I am sending you guys, one of you to set up the space this week, maybe Thursday or Friday, why not? I will be there,"" Ruto said.
The president further said the youth can choose the option of identifying a leader among them who will represent them, or decide how they want to engage him if they choose to be leaderless.
""When I suggested the multi-sectoral approach, I thought we were going to organise ourselves and this is how we are going to participate. And by the way, I wanted the whole of that set up to be about by young people; civil society, young people; religious organisations, young people; professional bodies, young people,"" Ruto added.
He, however, suggested that it has been very difficult for him because he doesn't know who to deal with.
""Whether it is Thursday, Friday... mkipangana mimi niko,"" Ruto asserted.
The president has called for dialogue with the protesting youth to discuss pressing national matters, among them unemployment and the high cost of living.
A section of the youth, however, is calling for his resignation. Addressing these calls, Ruto said the youth know the process of removing a sitting president from office.
""You can either wait for an election or follow the procedures laid down by the constitution,"" Ruto said.

https://www.citizen.digital/business/samsung-workers-to-strike-on-july-8-10-n345024,"Samsung workers to strike on July 8-10
The union is determining how many workers will join the strike, the official told Reuters by telephone.
Son Woo-mok, leader of the union, said late on Monday that the union wants a more transparent system for bonuses and time off, and wants the company to treat it as an equal partner.
Samsung declined to comment on the union's strike plan.
Its share price was unaffected, rising 0.1% in morning trade versus a 0.7% decline in the benchmark price index. (.KS11), opens new tab
Union membership increased rapidly after Samsung in 2020 pledged to stop discouraging the growth of organised labour.
The strike itself is unlikely to have a major impact on chip output as most production at the world's biggest memory chipmaker is automated, two analysts told Reuters.
But any impact will ultimately depend on how many people that operate chip plants participate and for how long, said senior researcher Kim Yang-Paeng at the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade.
""Chip production cannot proceed with replacement workers"" if people who operate the automated machines walked out for a long time ""because of the specificity and expertise of the work,"" Kim said.
Last month, workers en masse took annual leave on the same day in what was effectively the union's first industrial action. At the time, Samsung said there was no impact on production or business activity. Those striking were mainly employed at inner-city offices rather than at manufacturing sites, analysts said.
""This planned strike marks a turning point in Samsung's history of non-union management. This could be seen as a drop in employee loyalty at Samsung ... caused by wages and disappointing compensation compared to Samsung's rivals,"" a Seoul-based analyst said on Tuesday, declining to be identified as details of the strike were unknown.

From more private security being deployed on the ground by businesses, in addition to more officers on the ground; instances of criminals embedding themselves among protesters with sinister motives to cause chaos and invade businesses, boda boda riders warning protesters to ‘watch your back’ to avoid the theft of personal effects, the demonstrations left a trail of destruction, with at least 35 people admitted at Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) in Nairobi with gunshot wounds and varying injuries.
“There was quite a marked difference between today's protest and the ones that have been happening previously. There were a lot more private security guards around buildings,” Nerima Wako, CEO of Siasa Place, a youth-centric civic education organization, said.
She spoke during an X Space organized by Citizen Digital on Tuesday to analyse the impact of the anti-Finance Bill protests.
Speaking further about her experience during Tuesday’s protests, Wako said that in addition to the private security guards that had been deployed by businesses, there was a lot more security personnel on the ground.
“They were sort of guiding people to walk into town through certain routes. I also did notice a lot more guys and there was a lot more chaos with people trying to come into town walking in twos and threes rather than in large groups, because they were dispersing tear gas cannisters at groups that seemed to be more than five people,” she said.
Wako spoke of the infiltration of the protests by criminals, saying, “You could tell people who were there genuinely for the protest - some would try and assist you and guide you where to walk. However, in downtown (CBD), there were challenges with people trying to get towards certain buildings. There was a lot of chaos and actual gunshots in some areas.”
Another speaker during the X Space, was Bina Maseno, the executive director of Badili Africa, an organisation cultivating women towards political engagement. On her experience during the protests, she said, “By the time we were getting into town, there were groups of, even Boda Boda guys warning us that, ‘You're going to be robbed, pass the other route’.”
Maseno said the situation on the ground was different from what had been experienced during previous protests.
“It's not something we had experienced at the initial phase of the protests (the infiltration by criminals),” she said.
Maseno said that the infiltration made many protestors have to “watch your back” more and “it was hard for us to trust anyone”.
“You could be walking, but when someone talks to you, you're looking over your shoulder because you don't know if someone is going to trail you or if someone genuinely knows you from somewhere or is a genuine protester. And then when you move forward and you meet crowds crossing the road, you ask yourself whether they are robbing people,” she said.
Bina said that during the initial phase of the protests, many protesters were championing for change, taking to the streets without worrying about being robbed, but things have changed significantly.
“It's sad that people are coming out genuinely, to talk about what's ailing this country, and we're trying to quell that fire, but tactics are being used that are actually hurting the citizenry even more,” she said.

Abdul Kadir Abu Hashim, wildlife and national parks department director-general, said 400 tortoises worth 3.8 million ringgit ($805,084) bound for the lucrative exotic pet trade were seized during an operation by the police and wildlife officials on Saturday.
Across Asia, many believe that tortoises bring good luck and prosperity.
""This is the biggest ever seizure in the past 10 years,"" Abdul Kadir told AFP, adding that the reptiles were to be sold on to Thailand and Indonesia after local demand was met.
He said the tortoises were believed to have been smuggled from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal.
The joint operation, codenamed ""United National Resource"", crippled the tortoise smuggling ring known as the ""Ninja Turtle Gang"", he said.
The operation involved a car chase in which the driver of a vehicle thought to be used in the smuggling was arrested.
The driver subsequently led the enforcement officers to a location where rare three-keeled land turtles and Indian star tortoises were being kept.
Commercial trade in the Indian star tortoise was banned in 2019.
""The strategic location of Malaysia in Southeast Asia makes the country a hub for the smuggling of these exotic species,"" Abdul Kadir said.
The tortoises are illegally brought into Malaysia by road or in suitcases by smugglers aboard commercial flights, he said.
Traffic, a wildlife NGO, has previously said that Southeast Asian countries ""function as source, consumer and as entrepots for wildlife originating from within the region as well as the rest of the world"".

https://www.citizen.digital/news/hefty-fines-kenyans-face-ahead-of-shif-rollout-n345321,"Hefty fines Kenyans face ahead of SHIF rollout
Despite delays in the rollout, the mass registration began on July 1, 2024, as the government pushed the launch to October 1, 2024. This is part of the government's initiative to target all Kenyans to comply and register in the new Fund.
SHIF dictates that those in formal employment to part with 2.75 per cent of their salaries in monthly deductions while those in informal sector to contribute Ksh.500 monthly.
This differs from NHIF whereby, employees contribute between Ksh.1,400 to Ksh.1,700 monthly depending on their salaries and the employer matching the same. At the same time, self-employed Kenyans made a voluntary contribution of Ksh.500.
Following the rollout of the program, the government will seek to capitalise on over 17 million youths who are not NHIF members.
This means that anyone aged over 25, including the unemployed, will be required to pay SHIF.
In a recent interview by Health CS Susan Nakhumicha, she said that the government would observe the economic characteristics of unemployed and self-employed Kenyans such as transactions on mobile money platforms to determine how they will pay the Fund.
“If you live in a grass house, it cannot be hidden. We will observe the economic characteristics of the unemployed to see how they will contribute,"" Nakhumicha said in June 2024.
According to Section 26 (5) Social Health Act 2023, SHIF registration is mandatory for all Kenyans and foreigners residing in Kenya.
The consequences of not registering means that those who are not members will not be able to access government services.
They will be charged a penalty equal to two per cent of the amount which accumulates based on the months defaulted.
""A person who is registerable as a member under this Act shall produce proof of compliance with the provisions of this Act on registration and contribution as a precondition of dealing with or accessing public services from the national government, county government or national or county government entities,"" the law dictates.
In the Act, any employer who fails to remit contribution without any lawful excuse is liable to face a fine not exceeding Ksh.2 million or a three-year jail term or both.
Further, anyone who makes a false statement, whether orally or in writing, during registration to obtain preferential treatment or other benefits is liable to a fine not exceeding Ksh.1 million, 60 months imprisonment, or both.
Any person who misappropriates any assets of the Fund is also liable, upon conviction, to a prison term not exceeding five years or a fine not exceeding Ksh.10 million or both.
The law also penalizes any person who impersonates someone, whether living or dead, to obtain a benefit. He or she risks paying a Ksh.1 million fine or a three-year jail term or both.
Healthcare facilities that alter information to defraud the government face a Ksh.2 million fine and also risk suspension or removal from the register of contracted healthcare providers.
If a facility is suspended, the law states that the Social Health Authority shall publish their names in the Gazette and such institution shall cease from receiving any benefits from the Fund.

Machakos nurses have issued a 21-day strike
notice to the county government over unfavourable working conditions.
Through
their Kenyan National Union of Nurses (KNUN) Machakos branch Secretary Mike Saka, they on Thursday voiced their
grievances among them delayed promotions, inadequate pharmaceutical supplies
and lack of enough food supplies.
KNUN National Secretary General Seth Panyako on Wednesday backed the strike, urging the county government to address the issue before July 24, 2024, failure to which the nurses would down their tools.
“The
union now demands that the issues be addressed within the next 21 days from the
date of this letter. Failure to which, the members of the union will
commence strike on 24th July 2024 and shall remain on strike until their
issues have been fully addressed,” stated Panyako.
The
Mavhakos nurses lamented that promotions are long overdue, adding that there
are no enough staff at the hospitals.
“People
were interviewed and not employed…there are very unfair labour practices in
Machakos,” said Saka.
They
also cite adamancy by the county to listen to their demands and refusal to sign
the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).
“The
employer had requested to be allowed time to conclude on the process of
conducting interviews and employing new nurses between March and April. Despite
several follow-ups, the employer has been unwilling to engage the union,” Panyako
added.
“In
the meantime, the union is open to discussions and negotiations aimed at
resolving the issues raised herein.”
The nurses
also noted that the health centres and dispensaries have been opened yet there
are no extra nurses being employed.

Phil Foden has temporarily left England's Euro 2024 base in Germany to return home due to a ""pressing family matter,"" the English Football Association said on Thursday.
Foden, who won Premier League player of the year accolades for his starring role in Manchester City's title triumph this season, has started all three of England's games at the tournament so far.
It remains to be seen whether the 24-year-old will be available for the Three Lions' last 16 match on Sunday.
Foden is just one of a number of England stars that have failed to replicate their club form at international level at the Euros.
Gareth Southgate's men have progressed to the knockout stages at Group C winners but failed to live up to their hype as pre-tournament favourites in draws against Denmark and Slovenia after opening their campaign with a 1-0 win over Serbia.
However, England have found themselves on the kinder side of the draw as they will avoid Germany, France, Spain and Portugal until the final if they progress that far.

Gor Mahia midfielder Austin Odhiambo starred in the match, pulling Kenya's U23 team, Emerging Stars, ahead, before Benson Omalla made it 2-0.
Kenya is placed second in the Group B with six points, same as leaders Comoros who however have a superior goal difference after beating 1-0 in the other group match.
Ken Odhiambo's boys are hoping that either Angola or Namibia lose their final Group C matches on Wednesday, July 3, 2024, to enable them sneak through to the knockout stage as best runners-up.
Angola will face Lesotho while Namibia will square it out with Seychelles.
After a cagey first half, Kenya came back from the break with fresh ideas, and started off attacking which paid off in the 54th minute, when Odhiambo slotted home from inside the box after a cross from captain Rooney Onyango.
Another Gor Mahia player, striker Omalla made it 2-0 who just needed a touch to slot it home from a long ball from goalkeeper Byrne Omondi, to condemn Zimbabwe to their first defeat of the tournament.
Odhiambo, crowned man-of-the-match, attributed their win to the wind condition which favoured them in the second half.
""We had a very difficult first half because of the wind. We found it tough to pass through balls to our striker. In the second half we knew the wind would blow on our side so we had to push to get the two goals,"" said Odhiambo.
Odhiambo's sentiments were echoed by head coach Ken Odhiambo, who apart from lauding his charges for the crucial victory, cited their opponents' weakness in defending high balls.
""The first half we knew we wanted to contain them because of the wind, but in the second half we knew we would hit them as they were not very good in defending high balls and we capitalized on that one.""

A Spanish tourist was trampled to death by an elephant after stepping out of his vehicle to take photos of a small breeding herd at a renowned South African park, authorities said Tuesday.
The 43-year-old man was attacked on Sunday at the Pilanesberg National Park, a tourist magnet about 200 kilometres (120 miles) northwest of Johannesburg, according to park officials.
The man, his fiancee and two women were driving their own vehicle within the reserve when they spotted three elephants and three calves, police said.
""Reports suggest that the man stopped the vehicle, alighted and went closer to the elephants to take pictures,"" police spokesman Sabata Mokgwabone said.
North West province's Parks and Tourism Board (NWPTB), which manages Pilanesberg, said an adult female elephant then charged at the man.
""He was unfortunately not able to escape or evade the elephant, which was now joined by the whole herd, and was caught and trampled to death,"" it said.
""The elephants moved away immediately from the scene without any aggression towards the nearby vehicles and eventually disappeared into the bushes.""
Pieter Nel, NWPTB's chief conservation officer, said the matriarch of the herd attacked upon becoming ""agitated"" after seeing the tourist approach.
It is normal behaviour for elephants to try to ""defend the young ones"", he added.
""Lots of tourists are oblivious to the dangers and do not realise how dangerous these animals can be,"" he told AFP.
Nel and Mokgwabone said the man was from Spain.
His companions, all from Johannesburg, were unharmed, the police said, adding they had opened an investigation.
Elephant attacks are not uncommon in the region. In 2021 a suspected poacher was killed by elephants in South Africa's world-famous Kruger National Park.
And last year 50 people were killed and 85 injured by wild animals -- mostly elephants -- in neighbouring Zimbabwe, according to local authorities.
Pilanesberg and other South African parks tell visitors driving through the reserves to keep the windows closed and not to disembark from their vehicles.
""The dangerous and unpredictable nature of wild animals are always emphasised on the permits and booklets for sale in Pilanesberg,"" NWPTB said, adding it was saddened by the ""tragic incident"".

In the latest incident, one family is counting losses after thieves invaded their farm and stole cattle worth hundreds of thousands of shillings.
Speaking to Wananchi Reporting, Robert Waweru, said, “We were notified about the theft that happened when we were away and the cattle were traced to a site near a tea factory, where the thieves were slaughtering the animals.”
He continued, “Witnesses caught the thieves in the act and they scattered, leaving the carcasses.”
Waweru said the witnesses were able to capture the number plate of the vehicle the culprits fled with and filed a report with the police, awaiting investigations and a manhunt.
Locals called for police to enhance patrols, adding that cases of theft have been on the rise.
“We need the police to help maintain security in the area. Thieves know police are nowhere to be found and that is what is emboldening them to steal even more,” one resident said.
He continued, “Residents had organized themselves to be patrolling the area at night and we had seen cases of theft decline, however, we need the input of the police to make things work.”

Police
FC bag Football Krnya Federation Cup to earn a continental football slot after downing KCB 9-8 on
post-match penalties; the two sides drew 0-0 after extra time at Ulinzi Sports Complex, Nairobi.
The stadium was buzzing with anticipation as fans filled the stands, dressed in the vibrant colors of their respective teams.
The first half kicked off with both teams displaying a cautious approach, penetrating each other’s defenses but without creating clear-cut scoring opportunities.
The possession was evenly split, reflecting the intense battle unfolding on the field.
However, it was the sea of green and white, the KCB fans, who seemed to dominate the stands with their spirited chants and unwavering support.
As halftime approached, neither team managed to break the deadlock as the scores remained goalless.
The second half began with KCB pressing forward, taking advantage of a few defensive lapses from Police FC.
In the 57th minute, tension escalated when Police FC's goalkeeper, Matasia, had to momentarily leave the field due to an injury, prompting a brief pause in the action.
Despite the physicality of the game, the referee had initially been lenient with cards but soon started cautioning players as the intensity rose.
As the match progressed, it was KCB's goalkeeper, Farouk Shikalo, who emerged as a hero, making crucial saves to deny Police FC from taking the lead.
The 90 minutes ended without a breakthrough, and the game proceeded to extra time.
Fatigue was evident in the additional 30 minutes of play, with both teams visibly drained yet resilient.
Despite some close calls, neither side could find the back of the net, prolonging the suspense until the match was inevitably decided by penalties.
The shootout was a nerve-wracking affair, with both teams displaying remarkable composure under immense pressure.
With this hard-fought victory, Police FC secured not only the FKF Cup but also earned a coveted spot in continental football, marking a historic triumph for the club and its dedicated supporters.

far she has scored three goals, one shy of Kenya Police Bullets Mishi Mbaru.

Ann Aluoch, the assistant head coach of Kenya’s U17 women's football team, Junior Starlets, has urged the Ministry of Education in conjunction with the Ministry of Sports to postpone the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) examinations for eight players in the team to allow them participate in the forthcoming FIFA U17 women’s world cup slated for October 2024 in the Dominican Republic.
Kenya qualified for the continental showpiece for the first time ever after beating Burundi 2-0 to seal an aggregate 5-0 victory in the two-legged fourth round qualifier.
“We have eight players who will be sitting for their final exams in October and that means we risk losing them in the squad which will be travelling to the Dominican Republic for the World Cup. Most of them are our first team choice and I’m urging the Ministry of Education together with the Ministry of Sports to postpone their exams to March 2023 to allow them take part in the World Cup.
Aluoch feels that even if the eight players will be forced to sit for their exams, then their concentration will be still be in the competition which can also impact their results negatively.”
Ann who also doubles up as Mathare United women head coach also says there is a need to beef up the squad by signing new players ahead of the tournament.
“We broke the camp after our match against Burundi and we shall assemble again in a month’s time ahead of the World Cup. I feel that there is a need to bolster our squad by acquiring new players and we will rely on school games which are going on to spot great talents.”
The eight players facing the risk of missing the showpiece include Velma Auma (Wiyeta Girls), defenders Christine Adhiambo (Nyakach Sec) and Lorine Ilavonga (Wiyeta Girls).
Others are midfielder Velma Awuor (Nyakach Girls) and forward Marion Serenge (ArchBishop Njenga).
The Kenyans are primed to face England, Korea DPR and Mexico after being drawn in Group C.
The Mildred Cheche coached team which is making its debut in
the competition, will open their campaign against England on Thursday, October
17, 2024.

Published on: June 30, 2024 11:50 (EAT)

Mauritanians voted on Saturday to decide whether to re-elect President Mohamed Ould Cheikh El Ghazouani as head of the desert country, an oasis of peace in Africa's volatile Sahel region.
Around 1.9 million registered voters are set to choose between seven candidates vying to lead the sprawling nation, which has largely withstood the tide of jihadism in the region and is set to become a gas producer.
An AFP journalist saw voters queueing up at two polling stations at a school in the heart of the capital Nouakchott before polling began at 0700 GMT. Men and women formed separate lines in this deeply conservative Islamic nation.
The electoral commission said around 40 percent of eligible voters had cast their ballots two hours before the polls closed.
""I am here to fulfil my civic duty to complete the democratic process that began some decades back,"" said Mohamed Salem M'Seika, a 50-year-old voter.
Kertouma Baba, 26, said he wanted ""progress in education and opportunities for the youth"".
Barka Kharachi, 26, said she wanted ""a big change"" to ""sweep away all the corrupt men"".
Polling closed at 1900 GMT, and the first results were expected on Saturday evening. Official results are set to be announced on Sunday or Monday.
No major incidents were reported in the country.
""Everything went well. We didn't have any problems either with voters or candidate representatives,"" El Waght Abdallah, head of a polling station in a working-class district of Nouackchott, told AFP.
A 2019 election brought Ghazouani to power, marking the first transition between two elected presidents since independence from France in 1960 and a series of coups from 1978 to 2008.
Former general Ghazouani is the overwhelming favourite to win a second term. Some observers even consider a first-round victory is possible given, opposition divisions and the resources of the president's camp.
If there is a second-round vote, it will take place on July 14.
Campaigning was relatively peaceful, except for some scuffles on Monday in the northern town of Nouadhibou, when ""one candidate's supporters"" attacked backers of another candidate, the interior ministry said.
Ghazouani, a former security boss and army chief, is widely regarded as the mastermind behind the country's relative security.
While the Sahel has in recent years seen a string of military coups and escalating jihadism, particularly in Mali, Mauritania has not seen an attack since 2011.
Throughout the campaign, Ghazouani promised his supporters ""a resounding first-round victory"".
Posters of his face accompanied by the slogan ""the safe choice"" overshadow those of his political opponents both in Nouakchott and across the country.
The president cast his vote in Nouakchott on Saturday morning.
""I congratulate the Mauritanians for their high level of consciousness and their democratic spirit,"" he told reporters outside the polling station.
He welcomed a ""climate of peace and tranquillity"" during the election day.
After a first term hit by the fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, Ghazouani has made fighting poverty and supporting young people priority issues.
Over 70 percent of Mauritania's population is under 35, with young people increasingly drawn to the prospect of a better future in Europe or the United States.
With a second mandate, the incumbent has said he hopes to make more reforms thanks to a favourable economic outlook.
Growth should average 4.9 percent or 3.1 percent per capita for the period 2024-2026, according to the World Bank, spurred by the launch of gas production in the second half of this year.
Inflation has fallen from a peak of 9.5 percent in 2022 to five percent in 2023, and should continue to drop to 2.5 percent in 2024.
The president's two main rivals are rights activist Biram Dah Abeid, runner-up in the last two presidential elections, and the leader of the Islamist Tewassoul party, Hamadi Ould Sid' El Moctar.
Both vow radical change, ""an end to mismanagement and corruption"", and far-reaching education and justice reform.
They have also warned of fraud after denouncing a ""one-sided election"" and accused the Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI) of ""doing nothing to ensure that it runs smoothly"".
The two candidates both cast their votes Saturday morning.
Dah Abeid called on his supporters to ""fight fraud by all legal means"".
The opposition strongly contested the legislative elections a year ago, which were won by Ghazouani's party.
The African Union has sent a team of 27 short-term observers, while the European Union has sent three election experts.
The Mauritanian government has set up a national election monitoring body, which the opposition has denounced as a tool for manipulating the ballot.

The Kenya Union of Post Primary
Education Teachers (KUPPET) Embu branch has issued a strike notice to the
National Government, citing a dysfunctional health system.
While addressing the press from
their headquarters, the officials revealed the dire state of hospitals and
demanded government intervention within seven days.
The teachers raised concerns about
their inability to receive treatment, delays in hospital admissions, and
discrimination in some hospitals. Other challenges include difficulties
processing referrals across hospitals and raising money for orthopaedic implants
for accident victims.
Eric Kimwere, in charge of health at
the KUPPET Embu branch, also highlighted issues teachers face with their health
insurance covers in hospitals.
“Teachers have resorted to asking
for Harambees, which should not be acceptable because they have a comprehensive
health insurance cover,"" said Kimwere.
""We in KUPPET have no option.
We have now said enough is enough and will call our members to take to the
streets to make it clear that we are not ready to continue with this monkey
business,"" he reiterated.
Union officials expressed
frustration that teachers are deducted monthly for poor hospital services,
which do not reflect their contributions. Executive Secretary Jacob Karura
called on the TSC to clear outstanding hospital bills to facilitate smooth
operation.
""For nine months, hospitals
have not received disbursements from the government. We are pleading with TSC
to pay that money,"" said Karura.
“The government should immediately procure
drugs so teachers can be treated,” he reiterated.
Karura also raised concerns about
the rate at which teachers were resorting to fund drives despite having active
insurance covers. He stated that the government was not remitting their
deductions to insurance bodies. The union affirmed that their efforts to reach
the relevant authorities through letters have been futile.
“We are being told that the employer
has not paid hospitals. That is not our concern. All we want is treatment
because we have been deducted for that,” they stated.
The Union declared that if their
grievances were not addressed within the next seven days, they would march to
insurance head offices to demand their rights. Among the affected hospitals are
Teneri Hospital and Imara Hospital.
In response to speculation that the
rejected Finance Bill 2024 will affect teacher employment, KUPPET urged the
government to employ teachers on permanent and pensionable terms, without using
this as an excuse for their laxity in prioritizing teachers.

A fresh leadership brawl has emerged within Bunyore Starlets after the club's CEO Zachariah Amakhang’a, who has largely been absent this season, recently notified members about the elections for the club’s officials.
The move has created resistance from other officials who disagreed on the timing of the elections at the Kenya Women's Premier League side.
Amakhang’a urged
eligible members willing to take on responsibilities at the Mumboha-based club
to submit their nomination papers to him by Saturday, June 6.
In a letter circulated online,
Amakhang’a announced fourteen vacancies at the club, including the chairman
position currently held by Moses Mabwa.
When reached for clarification,
Amakhang’a said he had been waiting for the season to end before
""streamlining things in the team,"" noting that a lot had happened due
to single-handed leadership.
“Moses Mabwa has been making crucial
decisions in the club alone, and the time has come for a more inclusive
leadership that will steer the club to better heights next season,” Amakhang’a
stated.
“There is no reason to chest thump
in the name of the team; the fans are the ones who cater to the needs of this
club, not an individual.” He added that during the elections, they would also
appoint a board of directors to develop proper policies for Bunyore Starlets’
governance.
Moses Mabwa has dismissed
Amakhang’a's directives as attempts to seek sympathy after he was
suspended from the club last year over gross misconduct.
“Amakhang’a has no powers to
transact any business at Bunyore Starlets pending a FIFA verdict on allegations
that led to his suspension as CEO. He has been away all along; does he know who
has been footing the team’s bills or debts owed?” Mabwa posed.
Mabwa advised that Amakhang’a's
communiqué be dismissed, citing the club’s constitution, which states that elections
are to be held every five years.
According to Mabwa, the next
elections are scheduled for December this year. Still, he might call for elections
before the next season to address management issues in line with the
constitution.
This is the second public
disagreement between the two Bunyore Starlets leaders following the sexual
misconduct allegations that led to Amakhang’a’s suspension last year.
However, Amakhang’a maintains that
he allowed the season to end peacefully before taking steps to streamline the
team, declaring, “Enough is enough!”

In a media statement, Murkomen said his Ministry would look into alternative ways to secure the resources needed for road maintenance without raising petrol prices, as suggested by citizens.
He said a decision would be made once there was certainty that any revenue measures adopted would not result in a rise in the cost of living.
Murkomen said his ministry would review all public responses and make a decision based on the recommendations.
The CS also thanked Kenyans who had submitted e-mail, social media, and handwritten comments on the proposal
He said a majority expressed concern that a 39 percent increase in the the levy would exacerbate the cost of living crisis.
""I thank Kenyans across the country for turning up in large numbers to give their views on the maintenance of our roads,"" Murkomen stated.
""We will only make this decision when we are certain that any revenue measures adopted will not result in a rise in the cost of living.""
He said Kenya is currently facing a maintenance deficit of Ksh. 78 billion for the fiscal year 2024, with the figure expected to rise to Ksh. 315 billion by the fiscal year 2028/2029.
According to the Transport CS, Kenya's road network has expanded significantly, from 166,451 km in 2016 to 239,122 km currently, necessitating regular maintenance.
He explained that road maintenance is funded by the Ksh. 18 per liter Road Maintenance Levy
""Most of these abandoned roads are under the Low Volume Seal programme which have never been maintained in the last 10 years and are on the verge of being wiped away altogether,"" CS Murkomen added.
""The Roads Maintenance Levy Review is, therefore, intended to fill this gap.""
The Transport Ministry had urged the National Assembly's Finance and National Planning Committee to approve a 39 percent increase in the levy from Ksh.18 to Ksh.25, arguing that the current rates, last reviewed in 2016, do not account for inflation in road construction and maintenance costs over time.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/cs-duale-clarifies-june-rutos-selection-for-national-defence-college-amid-public-scrutiny-n345170,"CS Duale clarifies June Ruto's selection for National Defence College amid public scrutiny
Defence Cabinet Secretary Aden Duale has shed
light on the selection of President William Ruto's daughter, June Ruto, as a
student of the National Defence College (NDC).
This follows viral social media reports on
Wednesday claiming that June had been appointed Director of Foreign Service and
participant at the KDF training institution.
The reports sparked public interest, with
discussions revolving around the intersection of political influence and
opportunities within governmental institutions.
Speaking on Citizen TV's JKLive Show, Duale
explained that June was not appointed to the position but is among 67 students
selected to join the college as part of the institution's 27th cohort for the
2024/25 academic year.
June, Duale added, was nominated for the
1-year course by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where she is employed.
""June Ruto, a staff of the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, is one of the 67 students that have started their classes
today and she is among the three that were nominated by the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs to do the one-year national security strategy that Foreign Affairs ,
Immigration, KRA, EACC, NIS among other officers enroll for,"" said Duale.
""So we have 67 students that joined this
academic year and June Ruto is one of them.""
Duale officially inaugurated the new cohort
earlier on Wednesday, marking the start of the intensive program to
develop the strategic skills of military and government officials.
""This year's cohort includes 67
participants: 48 from the Kenya Defence Forces and government agencies, and 19
from 16 allied countries in Africa and Asia, reflecting a commitment to
regional and global security cooperation,"" he said in an X statement
following the event.
""The participants will engage in a
curriculum focused on leadership, strategic studies, and national security,
aiming to equip them with the skills to tackle contemporary security issues.
The presence of international participants seeks to enhance mutual
understanding and strengthen alliances for a unified approach to security.""
The National Defence College was established
in 1992 following recommendations from the Defence Council. In May 2000,
the college moved to a new complex within Karen.
Before the inception of the NDC, Kenyan
officers underwent training overseas. In response to the national imperative
for self-sufficiency in training, driven primarily by escalating costs of
foreign training and limited available slots, Kenya decided to establish its
own advanced training institution.
Due to the complexity of developing the right
curriculum, the first NDC course did not start until July 1997. Since then the
College has successfully run courses annually.
""The course size and composition has
increased steadily over the years to include participants from not only African
countries but also from Asia and Europe,"" reads NDC's website.
""The College was accredited to the
University of Nairobi in 2002 to offer Diploma and Masters of Arts degree in
International Studies as part of the College curriculum to improve on the
quality of the knowledge acquired by participants.""

Two more solders have been sentenced to death in the Democratic Republic of Congo after they fled battles in conflict-torn North Kivu province, a military court said on Friday.
Congo's army has been fighting the Rwanda-backed M23 insurgency for more than two years, as well as battling other militias in its eastern borderlands. The rebels seized the strategically important commune of Kanyabayonga last week.
The ruling, which follows the sentencing of 25 soldiers to death on Thursday, underscores the authorities' wish to show it will not tolerate the desertions that have contributed to putting Congo on the back foot in the conflict.
""This trial has a dissuasive and pedagogical character whose mission is to make soldiers see that fleeing the battle lines does not protect them, but it does expose them to heavy sanctions,"" state magistrate Kahambu Muhasa Melissa told Reuters.
The military tribunal said on Friday that one of the soldiers, Kakule Mupasula Raphael, had abandoned the front line in Kanyabayonga and fled. He was also found guilty of murdering the child of an officer.
He has pleaded not guilty and denied killing the child. He said he was not alone in leaving the front line.
""There were a lot of us soldiers who fled Kanyabayonga ... even our commanders fled too,"" he told Reuters. He plans to appeal the sentence.
A second soldier was accused of firing shots at an ambulance whose driver refused to take him in as the soldier was trying to leave the battlefield. He pleaded guilty and asked for extenuating circumstances to be taken into account.
Congo lifted an over 20-year moratorium on the death penalty in February for crimes including desertion and treason.
""With an inefficient and ineffective justice system ... the government's appalling move means many innocent people are now at risk of execution,"" Amnesty International warned.

President Ruto who spoke on Friday during an X Space Engagement Forum clarified that only 25 people lost their lives countrywide, including only one death in Githurai.
While maintaining that there was nothing like the alleged massacre which took place, he challenged those claiming to have different numbers to come forward with names and further appealed to the affected families to present the names of the missing persons.
“Please, let us not use information that is not verified, if what you say is true, let those families who claim their loved ones were killed come forward,” Ruto said.
An X user went on to allege that he had a list of the people killed, those missing and abducted, adding that the said list was circulating on social media platforms.
In a rejoinder, President Ruto said, “We have not seen people coming out and saying that they have missing family members or people who went to protests and are yet to come back home.”
The head of state at the same time reassured the listeners of his commitment to ensure that those culpable are brought to book, reiterating that the era of extrajudicial killings was a thing of the past.
Regarding the recent reported abductions, President Ruto said that he would take responsibility to ensure the police are held accountable.
Interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki on Thursday also pointed out that only 25 people lost their lives while 400 people were injured during the demonstrations.
Human Rights organisations had conflicting figures stating that over 40 people were killed and over 600 people injured in the protest melee.

Published on: June 30, 2024 01:05 (EAT)
The European Society for Quality Research (ESQR) this week recognised the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (KEMSA), after bestowing it the Best Quality Leadership Award 2024.
The outstanding achievement comes after the Authority's CEO, Dr Andrew Mulwa, bagged the African Governance Award, 2024, for his contribution to transforming KEMSA into the most Outstanding Medical Supplies Authority across the African continent. The award ceremony was held in Mauritius.
Dr Jane Masiga, a member of the KEMSA Board of Directors, received the award on behalf of Dr Mulwa and the Authority.
""On behalf of the board, which is spearheading the restructuring of KEMSA, and on behalf of the management, we dedicate this award to the staff of KEMSA, who have walked with us,"" Dr. Masiga said at the award ceremony held in Belgium.
ESQR recognised KEMSA's exemplary leadership led by its CEO and Board of Directors for embracing innovative and initiative-driven approaches in KEMSA to drive the development of quality systems, which have in turn transformed KEMSA into an efficient Health Products and Technologies supply chain solutions provider.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/why-dp-gachagua-wants-nis-director-general-noordin-haji-to-resign-n344740,"Why DP Gachagua wants NIS Director General Noordin Haji to resign
Addressing the press in Mombasa, a seemingly agitated DP blamed the NIS for the current anti-government protests which he said have led to deaths and destruction.
Despite President William Ruto making a last-minute turn and pronouncing himself on the matter that he would not ascent the controversial Finance Bill 2024 which resulted in countrywide demos, Gachagua says that the NIS failed in its mandate to inform the head of state of the situation on the ground before the citizens took to the streets.
While terming the last-minute decision by President Ruto to recall the Bill ‘embarrassing’ to the Kenya Kwanza government, Gachagua asserted that if Haji had done his job well and ensured the president and his administration were well aware of the public’s position on the Bill, no one would have died.
“Ruto deserves better, he deserves a DG who knows what he is doing, who is effective and can analyse situations to keep the government informed,” said Gachagua.
“It is embarrassing for me as DP that it has taken protests, deaths, mayhem and destruction for the president to know the truth yet there is an organization charged with that role.”
Gachagua argues that Haji’s incompetence stems from bungled circumstances surrounding his appointment to the state agency.
According to the deputy president, when Haji assumed the position of DG at NIS, he suffered an inferiority complex since he was once a junior officer at the same institution before he was promoted to his previous role as the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP).
The DP revealed that when Haji took over as NIS DG, he could not work with the already existing bosses since he had served under them, and thus he had to remove them from other state departments. As a result, Gachagua says the Intelligence body was stripped of competent individuals as other junior officers assumed high-ranking positions.
“Haji was a junior officer in the NIS before he was appointed as DPP. When he was appointed to the office as DG, because of the inferiority complex, he chased away all the people who were senior to him when he was in the service, thereby crippling the capacity of that service and making it dysfunctional,” said Gachagua.
“Three directors were chased away and reassigned to desk jobs in ministries across government. 13 assistant directors, men and women with proven track records of intelligence collection and analysis were removed from NIS leaving a shell and a clueless DG with no capacity to run the organization.”
The second in command further accused Haji of undertaking frequent travels across the globe which led him to lose his touch and grasp with the people and affairs of the nation and was thus unable to advise the president effectively.
“Had Noordin Haji done his job, we would not be here today. He has no capacity, he is out of the country most of the time on business trips and the country is on its own and my boss is exposed and he has to back down and admit that he has heard the people yet this matter has been in the public for over two months,” said the DP.
The DP consequently implored his boss to act accordingly and restore the three senior NIS directors dismissed together with the other 13 assistant directors in order to ensure the institution carries out its mandate effectively.
He also tasked the NIS boss to take responsibility for the lives of Kenyans lost in demos and the property lost countrywide.
“Haji must take responsibility for the deaths that occurred and for the mayhem and for failing Ruto, the government and he must take responsibility for failing the people for not doing his job and advising correctly. He must do the honourable thing, by not only taking responsibility but resigning from that office and allowing the president to pick a competent DG,” said Gachagua.
“I want to request President Ruto to consider as a matter of urgency to recall the three directors and 13 assistant directors removed from the service to come and help reconstruct the service and restore sanity back to NIS to serve the president, government and the people.”

https://www.citizen.digital/tech/google-translate-now-supports-dholuo-n345103,"Google Translate now supports Dholuo
The Alphabet-owned tech giant announced
that it is expanding the pool of languages Google Translate supports by rolling
out 110 new languages to the service.
The new update uses Artificial Intelligence
(AI) and is driven by Google’s PaLM 2 large language model, which also powers
the company’s AI chatbot, Bard.
Among the other new languages Google
Translate will support are Awadhi, Cantonese and Marwari.
Google senior software engineer Isaac
Caswell said that about a quarter of the languages are African. He called it
their “latest expansion of African languages to date.”
The Luo comprise several Nilotic ethnic
groups found across Egypt, Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Northern Uganda, eastern
DRC, western Kenya and a part of Tanzania.
The Joluo people consider themselves 'Luo proper' and their Dholuo language is spoken by about 4.2 million
Luo people in Kenya and Tanzania.
Caswell said for such languages with dialects,
varieties and spelling standards, Google Translate “will tend to output the
most common variety found online, but will also mix between varieties.”
“The models will certainly make some silly
mistakes in translation, but each one of them has gone through testing and
evaluation with native speakers. They are all ‘generally useful and right most
of the time’, and community members have emphasized that they are useful!” the
engineer wrote on X.
The latest update brings to 243 the number
of languages Translate currently supports as Google works towards building AI
models that will support the 1,000 world’s most spoken languages.

Last week, during Gen Z protests, shops were invaded by a group of young individuals, causing extensive damage and prompting fear among residents about their safety and property security.
From the CCTV footage, a group of young people are seen invading open businesses on Tuesday, July 2, 2024, and swiftly seizing valuable merchandise.
Chaos ensued as they fought over the items, causing substantial disorder and property damage.
Fearing for their safety, alarmed business owners were forced to take cover during the raid.
Following the incident, they promptly reported the occurrence to the Malindi police station
“Siku ya jumanne mwendo wa mchana mchana kunasemekana kuna hizo mambo ya maandamano. Kuna vijana waliingia kwa duka yangu na kunipora na kuharibu vitu na hata vingine kuchukua. Nimeenda nikaripoti kwa polisi malindi wakaniandikishia OB, statement sahii wanafuatilia,”said a businessperson Moses Musa.
Similar events such as these have been observed in various regions of the country, where initially peaceful demonstrations escalated into chaos as goons took advantage of the situation to infiltrate and plunder properties.
“Mimi ni jirani wa huyu jamaa mwenye alikuwa ameporwa viatu, gesi kila kitu, ni jirani wangu wa karibu. Na hao vijana vile walikuwa wamefanya si vizuri serikali lazima ifanye mambo kwasababu hao vijana kama hawatachukuliwa hatua watafanya bado hio kitendo,”a witness Ali Hamdi stated.

Residents of Malindi have expressed concerns about their safety and the security of their property. The Police say investigations are ongoing, and they expect to gather more evidence to take action against those responsible

Making his submissions at the Senate on Wednesday, Sifuna recalled receiving a high figure allocated to his GK vehicle when he was appointed as the Deputy Minority Whip at the Senate.
He noted that when he used the Nairobi Expressway on Wednesday morning, he was surprised to find out that he remained with Ksh.377,000 on his Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) card. The ETC system automatically pays the fee on toll roads without stopping the vehicle.
""We need to relook at our budgets and see where we can make major cuts for the public to feel we're lessening the budget. When I became the Deputy Minority Whip, I was allocated a GK vehicle. On the first day that I used that car to go home, I used the expressway. I was shocked at the amount of money that is on my ETC card for my Parliamentary car. As of this morning, when I used that same car to come here, there is Ksh.377,000 on my ETC card,"" Sifuna pointed out.
""It does not make sense, so what you do. MPs, staff have to be honest with Kenyans. There are ways of reducing the expenditure in a manner that will reduce the burden on taxpayers. I don't need all that money, even if I ran up and down the expressway for a year, I would never exhaust the amount. We must do this so that we demonstrate to the people that we are serious.""
In the revised charges released on January 1, 2024, the least amount a motorist can pay for using the Nairobi Expressway is Ksh.170 while the highest is Ksh.500.
Sifuna noted that the anti-government protests staged by Kenyan youth exhibit their distress in the current leadership, emphasising that a radical change should occur.
Further, he pointed out that he has since turned down invitations from media houses as Kenyans seek for leaders to stop talking and begin taking action.
""All they are saying is that we as the leadership need to stop talking and listen to these young people. I have been turning down invitations to media houses because I'm asking why don't they invite the Gen Zs to speak,"" he pointed out.
""Would you believe it that many Gen Zs are afraid that they will not leave the TV stations and get home because of either being arrested or detained. We need to show remorse as leaders.""
The Senator also called for an audit of all cases that were withdrawn by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecution (ODPP) in the past 24 months to determine the legal basis of the decision. He questioned why a politician accused of stealing billions of shillings is let off the hook after he agrees to return Ksh.300 million.
""I want to call for an audit of all the cases that have been withdrawn in the past 12 or 24 months so that we understand the legal basis for the withdrawal of these cases,"" he pointed out.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/tear-gas-stones-and-flames-as-kenya-protesters-say-ruto-must-go-n345093,"Tear gas, stones and flames as Kenya protesters say 'Ruto must go!'
The nationwide demonstrations signalled that President William Ruto had failed to appease a spontaneous youth protest movement, despite having abandoned plans for tax rises that triggered the unrest last week.
Tuesday's demonstrations began in ebullient mood but turned violent as the day wore on. In Nairobi's downtown business district, police wearing helmets and carrying shields and wooden clubs charged at the protesters, and tear gas bombs exploded in the crowds.
A kiosk was set ablaze in the centre of a street. Medics tended to a youth who lay on the pavement with a bloody hand. Police bundled other youths into the bed of a pickup truck.
Outside the capital, hundreds of protesters marched through Mombasa, Kenya's second largest city, on the Indian Ocean coast. They carried palm fronds, blew on plastic horns and beat on drums, chanting ""Ruto must go!""
Later, Kenya's NTV television reported two people shot in Mombasa, showing pictures of cars ablaze.
Ruto, facing the worst crisis of his nearly two-year-old presidency, has been caught between the demands of lenders such as the International Monetary Fund to cut deficits, and a hard-pressed population reeling from the soaring cost of living.
Members of the protest movement, which has no official leaders and largely organises via social media, have rejected Ruto's appeals for dialogue - even after he abandoned his proposed tax rises.
""People are dying in the streets and the only thing he can talk about is money. We are not money. We are people. We are human beings,"" protester Milan Waudo told Reuters in Mombasa. ""He needs to care about his people, because if he can't care about his people then we don't need him in that chair.""
Other protests took place in Kisumu, Nakuru, Kajiado, Migori, Mlolongo and Rongo, according to images broadcast on Kenyan television. In the southwestern town of Migori, protesters set tyres on fire.
Activists blamed Tuesday's violence on infiltrators they said had been unleashed by the government to discredit their movement, and said it was now time for protesters to disperse.
""Good people. Let’s go home. As usual the government has let goons take over, loot, and burn property again,"" one of the most prominent activists, Boniface Mwangi, wrote on X.
The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNHCR) says 39 Kenyans have been killed in demonstrations and clashes with police since June 18. Most of the deaths took place on June 25 when officers opened fire near parliament where some protesters tried to storm the building to prevent lawmakers from voting on the tax hikes.
'BEAUTIFUL DAY'
""We are determined to push for the president's resignation,"" said Ojango Omondi, an activist in Nairobi. ""We hope for a peaceful protest and minimal casualties, if any.""
The authorities appealed for calm.
""It's a beautiful day to choose patriotism. A beautiful day to choose peace, order and the sanctity of our nationhood,"" State House communications director Gerald Bitok wrote on X on Tuesday, adding in Swahili: ""Violence is not patriotism.""
Opposition leader Raila Odinga, runner-up in the last four presidential elections, backed the protesters though they have called on politicians to keep out of it.
""The youth have given our country its last best chance,"" Odinga's ODM party said in a statement. ""We either seize it and swim with it by implementing all their demands, or we ignore it and sink the country altogether.""
The protests, which started as an online outpouring of anger over nearly $2.7 billion of tax increases in a proposed finance bill, have grown into a nationwide movement against corruption and misgovernance.
Ruto has directed the treasury to come up with ways to cut spending to fill a budget gap left by the withdrawal of the tax plans, and also said more borrowing would be required.
Veteran anti-corruption activist John Githongo told Reuters that while Ruto had addressed the nation and media, ""there isn't an indication that he wants to take action"" on protesters' demands, including firing corrupt officials.
""There hasn't been any indication by the government that they are going to take the calls to deal with corruption seriously,"" he said.
The protests had been mostly peaceful until June 25, when some demonstrators briefly stormed parliament and set part of it ablaze, prompting police to open fire.
Ruto has defended the actions of the police and blamed the violence on ""criminals"" who had hijacked the demonstrations.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/france-begins-voting-in-election-that-could-hand-power-to-far-right-n344939,"France begins voting in election that could hand power to far right
Published on: June 30, 2024 02:30 (EAT)
French voters began voting on Sunday in the first round of a snap parliamentary election that could usher in the country's first far-right government since World War Two, a potential sea change at the heart of the European Union.
President Emmanuel Macron stunned the country when he called the vote after his centrist alliance was crushed in European elections this month by Marine Le Pen's National Rally (RN). Her eurosceptic, anti-immigrant party was a longtime pariah but is now closer to power than it has ever been.
Polls opened at 0600 GMT and will close at 1600 GMT in small towns and cities, with an 1800 GMT finish in the bigger cities, when the first exit polls for the night and seat projections for the decisive second round a week later are expected.
However the electoral system can make it hard to estimate the precise distribution of seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, and the final outcome will not be known until the end of voting on July 7.
""We are going to win an absolute majority,"" said Le Pen in a newspaper interview on Wednesday, predicting that her protégé, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella would be prime minister. Her party has a high-spending economic programme and seeks to reduce immigration.
If the RN does win an absolute majority, French diplomacy could be headed for an unprecedented period of turbulence: with Macron - who has said he will continue his presidency until the end of his term in 2027 - and Bardella jostling for the right to speak for France.
At a voting station in Sevres, on the outskirts of Paris, 70-year-old former company director Didier Delacroix said he had voted for Macron's alliance.
""Otherwise it'll be a complete mess,"" he said.
France has had three periods of ""cohabitation"" - when the president and government are from opposite political camps - in its post-war history, but none with such radically divergent world views competing at the top of the state.
Bardella has already indicated he would challenge Macron on global issues. France could lurch from being a pillar of the EU to a thorn in its side, demanding a rebate of the French contribution to the EU budget, clashing with Brussels over European Commission jobs and reversing Macron's calls for greater EU unity and assertiveness on defence.
A clear RN victory would also bring uncertainty as to where France stands on the Russia-Ukraine war. Le Pen has a history of pro-Russian sentiment and while the party now says it would help Ukraine defend itself against Russian invaders, it has also set out red lines, such as refusing to provide long-range missiles.
'SPLIT VOTE FAVOURS RN'
Opinion polls have suggested the RN has a comfortable lead of 33-36% of the popular vote, with a hastily assembled left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, in second place on 28-31% and Macron's centrist alliance in third on 20-23%.
The New Popular Front includes a wide range of parties, from the moderate centre-left to the hard-left, eurosceptic, anti-NATO party France Unbowed, led by one of Macron's most vitriolic opponents, Jean-Luc Melenchon.
How the poll numbers will translate into seats in the National Assembly is hard to predict because of how the election works, said Vincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Nice and the Ecole Polytechnique.
Candidates can be elected in the first round if they win an absolute majority of votes in their constituency, but that is rare. Most constituencies will need a second round involving all candidates who received votes from at least 12.5% of registered voters in the first round. The top scorer wins.
""If you have a very high level of participation you might have a third or fourth party that is getting into the struggle. So then of course there's a risk of split voting and we know that the split vote favours the National Rally,"" said Martigny.
For decades, as the far right steadily gained popularity, voters and parties who did not support it would unite against it whenever it edged closer to national power, but that may not hold true this time.
Martigny said no one knew whether candidates from Macron's camp would consider dropping out of the second round to give rivals from the left a chance of beating the RN, or the reverse.
Le Pen and Bardella have sought to make their party's image more acceptable to the mainstream, for example by denouncing antisemitism. Le Pen's father Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder and long-term leader of the RN's forerunner, had a history of overtly antisemitic comments.
But critics say the RN's courting of Jews is just a cover allowing it to deny accusations of racism while constantly stigmatising Muslims and foreigners.

Tourism and Wildlife Cabinet Secretary Dr.
Alfred Mutua has asserted that the outlook of Kenya's tourism sector remains
positive despite ongoing nationwide anti-government protests.
Addressing journalists after an extensive
review meeting with tourism stakeholders in Nairobi on Wednesday, CS Mutua
noted that Kenya remains open for business and is ready to welcome tourists in
spite of the recent disturbances.
He further projected that Kenya anticipates
hosting 3 million tourists by the end of the year, with anticipated
numbers surpassing 5 million over the next two years.
""While there have been a few
postponements of bookings, mainly for events, new bookings are also coming in.
Our upward trend has slowed slightly, but the sector remains stable, and Kenya
is ready for the ongoing high season,"" he said.
""Our national parks, beaches, museums,
and other attractions continue to draw many visitors. Maasai Mara, Amboseli,
Nakuru, and Tsavo are fully booked without any disruptions. The increase in
numbers translates to more revenue for the country and numerous new job
opportunities, especially for the youth.""
The CS further emphasized that the tourism
sector is vital to Kenya’s economy, being one of the largest employers with 80
percent of its workforce comprising the youth.
Additionally, he underscored the critical
need for stability within the sector, emphasizing that disruptions inevitably
result in job losses and hindered employment prospects.
""Tourism contributed about Ksh.353
billion to the Kenyan economy last year and has been on an upward trend. We aim
to see this sector grow significantly, targeting Ksh.700 billion per year in
the next few years.""
Dr. Mutua also highlighted the government's
measures to ensure the stability of the tourism sector in Mombasa and Diani,
noting that flights to these destinations are fully booked, with charter
flights operating normally.
He further called on all visitors, both local
and international, to continue with their travel plans to Kenya, promising the
usual high standards of hospitality.
Mutua was accompanied by Mike Macharia, CEO
of the Kenya Association of Hotel Keepers, Catherine Murage, National Treasurer
of the Kenya Association of Hotel Keepers, Fred Odek, Chairman of the Kenya
Tourism Federation, and senior officials from the ministry and associated
parastatals.

Munyakho,50, has spent 13 years in different Saudi prisons and was sentenced to death by the sword after being involved in a fight with a colleague in April 2011 and the other party succumbed to injuries.
The victim's family has since demanded the costly 'blood money' or 'diya' - a financial compensation under Islamic law paid to the victim or heirs of a victim in the cases of murder, bodily harm, or involuntary property destruction.
Appearing before the legislative House, Mudavadi said that there is a pending relief since Munyakho's execution was deferred but the compensation amount cannot be settled unless the victim's family scales it down.
""The family has raised Ksh.10 million. There is no budgetary provision for the government to settle this kind of situation whether in Saudi or any other country,"" he said.
""The government is trying to do what it can to see if this matter can be resolved differently and if the family who lost the individual can perhaps climb down from the high level of Ksh.150 million.""
On May 13, Foreign Affairs Principal Secretary Korir Sing’oe said that Saudi Arabia agreed to postpone the impending execution of Munyakho which was due on May 15.
“I am deeply grateful to inform (sic) that authorities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have kindly granted our request to postpone the impending execution of Stephen Munyakho (now known as Abdulkareem), to allow for further negotiations between all parties,” the PS said on X.
Mudavadi further stated that 316 Kenyans have lost their lives in the Gulf states from 2002 to date. Of these 166 died in Saudi Arabia, 58 in Qatar, 51 in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), 25 in Iraq, Bahrain (10), and Kuwait (6).
The Prime CS added that 416,548 Kenyans are currently in the Gulf States among them 310,266 in Saudi Arabia, 66,025 in Qatar, 23,000 in UAE and 8,000 in Bahrain.
Other 5,392 are in Oman, 3,515 in Kuwait, 200 in Iran and 150 in Iraq.
""It should be noted that not all Kenyans register with our missions abroad despite being sensitized on the importance of such registrations hence sometimes it is difficult to have very precise data,"" he told Senators.

https://www.citizen.digital/opinion-blogs/the-imf-is-failing-countries-like-kenya-why-and-what-can-be-done-about-it-n345104,"The IMF is failing countries like Kenya: why, and what can be done about it
Published on: July 03, 2024 10:12 (EAT)
The IMF logo is pictured in Washington, U.S., April 21, 2017. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas
The recent Kenyan protests are a warning that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is failing. The public does not think it is helping its member countries manage their economic and financial problems, which are being exacerbated by a rapidly changing global political economy.
To be sure, the IMF is not the only cause of Kenya’s problems with raising the funds to meet its substantial debt obligations and deal with its budget deficit. Other causes include the failure of the governing class to deal with corruption, to spend public finances responsibly and to manage an economy that produces jobs and improves the living standards of Kenya’s young population.
The country has also been hammered by drought, floods and locust infestations in recent years. In addition, its creditors are demanding that it continue servicing its large external debts despite its domestic challenges and a difficult international financial and economic environment.
The IMF has provided financial support to Kenya. But the financing is subject to tough conditions which suggest that debt obligations matter more than the needs of long-suffering citizens. This is despite the IMF claiming that its mandate now includes helping states deal with issues like climate, digitalisation, gender, governance and inequality.
Unfortunately, Kenya is not an isolated case. Twenty-one African countries are receiving IMF support.
In Africa, debt service, on average, exceeds the combined amounts governments are spending on health, education, climate and social services.
The tough conditions attached to IMF financing have led the citizens of Kenya and other African countries to conclude that a too powerful IMF is the cause of their problems. However, my research into the law, politics and history of the international financial institutions suggests the opposite: the real problem is the IMF’s decline in authority and efficacy.
Some history will help explain this and indicate a partial solution.
When the treaty establishing the IMF was negotiated 80 years ago, it was expected to have resources equal to roughly 3% of global GDP. This was to help deal with the monetary and balance of payments problems of 44 countries. Today, the IMF is expected to help its 191 member countries deal with fiscal, monetary, financial and foreign exchange problems and with “new” issues like climate, gender and inequality.
To fulfil these responsibilities, its member states have provided the IMF with resources equal to only about 1% of global GDP.
The decline in its resources relative to the size of the global economy and of its membership has at least two pernicious effects.
The first is that it is providing its member states with less financial support than they require if they are to meet the needs of their citizens and comply with their legal commitments to creditors and citizens. The result is that the IMF remains a purveyor of austerity policies. It requires a country to make deeper spending cuts than would be needed if the IMF had adequate resources.
The second effect of declining resources is that it weakens the IMF’s bargaining position in managing sovereign debt crises. This is important because the IMF plays a critical role in such crises. It helps determine when a country needs debt relief or forgiveness, how big the gap between the country’s financial obligations and available resources is, how much the IMF will contribute to filling this gap and how much its other creditors must contribute.
When Mexico announced that it could not meet its debt obligations in 1982, the IMF stated that it would provide about a third of the money that Mexico needed to meet its obligations, provided its commercial creditors contributed the remaining funds.
It was able to push the creditors to reach agreement with Mexico within months. It had sufficient resources to repeat the exercise in other developing countries in Latin America and eastern Europe.
The conditions that the IMF imposed on Mexico and the other debtor countries in return for this financial support created serious problems for these countries. Still, the IMF was an effective actor in the 1980s debt crisis.
Today, the IMF is unable to play such a decisive role. For example, it has provided Zambia with less than 10% of its financing needs. It has been four years since Zambia defaulted on its debt and, even with IMF support, it has not yet concluded restructuring agreements with all its creditors.
The solution to this problem requires the rich countries to provide sufficient finances for the IMF to carry out its mandate. They must also surrender some control and make the organisation more democratic and accountable.
In the short term, the IMF can take two actions.
First, it must set out detailed policies and procedures that explain to its own staff, to its member states and to the inhabitants of these states what it can and will do. These policies should clarify the criteria that the IMF will use to determine when and how to incorporate climate, gender, inequality and other social issues into IMF operations.
They should also describe with whom it will consult, how external actors can engage with the IMF and the process it will follow in designing and implementing its operations. In fact, there are international norms and standards that the IMF can use to develop policies and procedures that are principled and transparent.
Second, the IMF must acknowledge that the issues raised by its expanded mandate are complex and that the risk of mistakes is high.
Consequently, the IMF needs a mechanism that can help it identify its mistakes, address their adverse impacts in a timely manner and avoid repeating them.
In short, the IMF must create an independent accountability mechanism such as an external ombudsman who can receive complaints.
Currently, the IMF is the only multilateral financial institution without such a mechanism. It therefore lacks the means for identifying unanticipated problems in its operations when they can still be corrected and for learning about the impact of its operations on the communities and people it is supposed to be helping.

Luciano Spalletti will stay on as Italy coach despite the Azzurri's humbling elimination from Euro 2024, the country's football chief said on Sunday.
Italy were dumped out of the Euros at the last 16 stage after being soundly beaten 2-0 by Switzerland in Berlin on Saturday night, but a disastrous title defence has not cost Spalletti his job.
""I'm pragmatic, it's impossible to resolve problems by abandoning a long-term project or by abandoning the coach and players who have accompanied us in this project,"" Gabriele Gravina, head of Italy's football federation, told reporters.
Italy came into the Euros as reigning champions but flopped in Germany under Spalletti, who replaced Euro 2020 winner Roberto Mancini last summer.
""Spalletti has our faith, he has to have our faith, he needs to get to work, as in 60 days the Nations League begins,"" added Gravina.
""We can't imagine that a (Kylian) Mbappe or Cristiano Ronaldo will suddenly come on the scene, so we need to be patient.""
Spalletti took the Italy job with a huge amount of credit after leading Napoli to a historic Serie A title but has had a dreadful tournament, chopping and changing line-ups and formations and railing at journalists.
The 65-year-old said before the tournament that he would bring the best version of himself into the biggest job of his long and eventful coaching career.
Asked if he had achieved that, Spalletti said: ""Obviously not, because if not I would be here talking about something different.""
""The match last night brought us back down to zero, and it's from there that we need to start again,"" said Spalletti.
Italy begin their Nations League campaign against France in Paris on September 6, and also face Belgium and Israel in Group A2.

Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale is calling
for a total abolishment of the offices of First Lady, Spouse of the Deputy President,
Spouse of the Prime Cabinet Secretary and county first ladies.
This is in the wake of President William
Ruto’s Sunday announcement that his government will adopt austerity measures after
he declined to assent to the unpopular Finance Bill 2024 following public uproar
and deadly protests.
Ruto told a media roundtable at State House
Nairobi that his wife Rachael Ruto’s office and that of Dorcas Rigathi, wife of
Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua will be scrapped off this year’s budget.
Khalwale on Wednesday termed the offices a
waste of public resources. He criticised the Office of the First Lady as unconstitutional,
saying it has unnecessarily been “gobbling millions of shillings” over the years.
“As if that is not enough, we have an office
for the Deputy President’s wife and another for the wife of the Prime Cabinet
Secretary and the same with governors,” Khalwale told the Senate.
“If I ascended to one of these
offices, you would shake my family. Who among my first, second or third wife would
be the First Lady? Those are private family issues that should never be brought
to the public!”
Mrs Ruto’s office has since 2022 been
involved in initiatives around religion and women's economic empowerment under
a strategy she has christened ‘faith diplomacy’.
On the other hand, Mrs Rigathi has been
running ‘boychild empowerment’ programs targeting Kenyan youth hooked on drug
and substance abuse.
Both offices were allocated Ksh.1.2 billion
in total for the 2024/2025 financial year starting July, with Mrs Ruto's office
getting Ksh.696.6 million and Mrs Rigathi’s Ksh.557.5 million.
Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi launched an office for his wife Tessie Mudavadi in February last year to “complement work being done by the Office of the First Lady and the Office of the Spouse to the Deputy President.”
Meanwhile, Kitui Senator Enoch Wambua has challenged President Ruto to reduce his Cabinet size from 21 to 14 Cabinet
Secretaries as part of his austerity push.
“The Constitution states that the President
can appoint 14-22 cabinet secretaries. Right now, we have 21. I call on the President,
as a demonstration that he has listened to what the people say, to reduce the
size of his Cabinet Secretaries from 21 to 14,” Wambua told the Senate.
He also called for a merge of State
Departments and consequentially Principal Secretaries from 51 to 14.

Spain said Thursday it will send 313 police officers to Paris to bolster security for this summer's Olympic Games as France remains on high alert following attack threats.
The officers, including bomb deactivation experts and sniffer dog teams, will be deployed in response to a request from France for foreign assistance with Games security, the Spanish interior ministry said in a statement.
France, which will host the games from July 26 to August 11, has raised its security alert to the highest level after the deadly attack at a Moscow concert hall in March. The Islamic State (IS) group claimed responsibility for the massacre.
The Spanish police will stay in Paris for the Paralympics which will be held from August 28 to September 8, the statement added.
The French capital has been repeatedly hit by deadly attacks by Islamic extremists and security concerns are notably high for the opening ceremony of the Games, which will involve boats along the Seine River and huge crowds watching from the embankments.
Nearly 45,000 police officers and gendarmes will be mobilised in the Paris region for the event. During the games themselves, 18,000 French military troops will be deployed, including 3,000 responsible for aerial surveillance -- in addition to about 35,000 police and gendarmes.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/us-bases-across-europe-bracing-for-possible-terror-attack-n345076,"US bases across Europe bracing for possible terror attack
U.S. military bases and personnel across Europe are on heightened alert, after new intelligence warned of a possible terror attack targeting either facilities or personnel.
A U.S. defense official Monday confirmed to VOA that military installations across U.S. European Command (EUCOM) have been elevated to Force Protection Condition “Charlie,” which means an attack of some sort is likely.
The official did not elaborate on the contents of the intelligence that sparked the change, although counterterrorism officials from multiple countries have warned of an increased threat, including some surrounding the upcoming Summer Olympics in Paris.
The U.S. defense official said that the military is “taking extra steps to ensure [U.S. troops] remain vigilant during both business and pleasure activities.”
A second U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, emphasized it was the overall threat picture and not one single piece of intelligence, that led to the increased force protection posture.
“There is no specific or imminent threat to U.S. forces in Europe,” the official told VOA. “This was a step taken out of an abundance of caution.”
A statement Monday from EUCOM likewise indicated the increased security measures are the result of a combination of factors.
“Our increase in vigilance is not related to any one single threat, but out of concern of a combination of factors such as ongoing and upcoming large public forums including the Euro Cup and the Olympics, along with an increasing the threat of attacks by potential bad actors against various non-military targets in Europe,” the statement read.
EUCOM “advises personnel in the European theater to remain vigilant and stay alert at all times, including reporting suspicious activity, monitoring Department of State travel advisories, and implementing prudent personal risk mitigation measures,” it added.
A report issued last month by the by the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future warned that despite a high risk of cyberattacks, the greatest threat to the Paris Olympics remains the possibility for terror attacks.
French authorities have already disrupted at least two separate terror plots. In one of the cases, the 18-year-old suspect was charged with plotting to carry out an attack on one of the stadiums serving as Olympic venues in the name of the Islamic State.
Top U.S. counterterrorism officials have also acknowledged that the Islamic State terror group, known as IS or ISIS, has also been gaining momentum in recent months.
Much of the concern has focused on the group’s Afghan affiliate, known as IS-Khorasan.
""Both ISIS and ISIS-Khorasan ... have demonstrated a capability and intent to conduct external operations,"" White House Deputy Homeland Security Advisor Jen Daskal told a counterterrorism conference in Omaha, Nebraska, last week.
National Counterterrorism Center Director Christine Abizaid also warned about IS-Khorasan this past May.
“This ability of the global ISIS enterprise, even without territorial solidity, the ability to reach out virtually to a network of supporters, some of whom are going to conduct attacks, is quite concerning,” she told a security conference in Doha.
Abizaid further called IS-Khorasan's ability to reestablish itself in Afghanistan “probably the most significant additive capability we’ve seen to the global ISIS network in the last three years.”
IS-Khorasan claimed responsibility for the January attack on a memorial service in Kerman, Iran, that killed about 90 people, and also the March attack on a Moscow concert hall that killed more than 140 people.
U.S. counterterrorism officials have also raised concerns that IS-Khorasan has become more adept at using transnational criminal networks and human smuggling rings, eying potential plots to send its operatives into the United States.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/uk-election-winner-keir-starmer-inherits-weak-economy-with-no-magic-wand-n345262,"UK election-winner Keir Starmer inherits weak economy with 'no magic wand'
Britain's next prime minister Keir Starmer
spent the election campaign accusing Rishi Sunak's
Conservatives of ""14 years of economic failure"", but he has no
obvious quick fix to lift the country out of its slow-growth rut.
Living standards have stagnated since
Conservatives took power in 2010 and Britain's recovery from the COVID pandemic
has been the weakest among big rich nations after Germany.
Starmer will be
under pressure to use Labour's huge majority in parliament to end the sense of
decline, from creaking public services and inflation-hit personal finances to a
shortage of housing and weak business investment.
But with public debt at almost 100% of gross
domestic product and taxes at their highest since just after World War Two,
Starmer stresses the turnaround will take time.
""We're going to have to do really tough
things to move the country forward,"" he told voters days before the
election. ""There is no magic wand.""
Unlike in 1997, when Labour under Tony Blair
ousted the Conservatives with the economy expanding by almost 5% that year,
Starmer might struggle to get British annual growth above 2% in the foreseeable
future, in line with much of a sluggish Europe.
Britain's economy is expected to grow by less
than 1% this year.
The 2007-08 global financial crisis which hit
Britain particularly hard, cuts to many areas of public spending and the shocks
of Brexit, COVID and surging energy prices have combined to weigh on the
world's sixth-biggest economy.
But Starmer and his likely choice of finance
minister Rachel Reeves say they will not go on a borrowing binge to fund a
growth push, with memories still fresh of the 2022 bond market rout under
former Conservative prime minister Liz Truss.
They have also promised no major tax
increases, leaving the new government with little room in the budget.
""The fiscal inheritance will be a
difficult one and there are a lot of challenges to address,"" Lizzy
Galbraith, a political economist with investment firm abrdn, said.
Unlike in 1997, when Labour stunned financial
markets by handing operational independence to the Bank of England, its first
economic policy move is likely to be low key.
It plans to move
quickly to reform Britain's archaic planning system to speed up investment in
house-building and infrastructure, part of a plan to improve the country's weak
productivity, support growth and generate more tax revenues to invest in health
and other strained public services.
The Conservatives balked at upsetting core
supporters in suburban areas where much of any surge in residential
construction is likely to happen.
Starmer promises to be hard-headed about
breaking down the barriers to growth, but the challenge will be big.
""We've been here before with an incoming
government promising planning reform and it gets watered down in office,""
Galbraith at abrdn said.
Jack Paris, chief executive of InfraRed, an
international infrastructure asset manager, expects Labour will turn more to
private investment for green energy and speed up transportation projects.
""The new UK government should provide
increased clarity and visibility to investors with a long-term infrastructure
strategy representing a catalyst to making the UK again one of the most
attractive destinations for long-term investors,"" he said.
Also on Starmer's to-do list is reversing the
post-pandemic rise in people dropping out of the jobs market due to sickness,
something other rich economies have already done.
The Boston Consulting Group and the NHS
Confederation, representing much of the health service, estimate that getting
three-quarters of workforce dropouts since 2020 back into the jobs market could
boost tax revenues by as much as 57 billion pounds in total over the next five
years.
For context, Britain spends around 11 billion
pounds a year running its justice system.
Starmer's growth plan also includes lowering
some of the barriers to trade with the European Union. But he has ruled out a
major reworking of Britain's Brexit deal.
Economists say Labour's policies to date are
unlikely to make a big difference, much less meet Starmer's goal of turning
Britain into the Group of Seven leader for sustainable economic growth,
something it has barely managed since World War Two.
Higher public investment would be
growth-positive but Labour pledges to cut immigration could have the opposite
effect.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs say Labour's
reforms will boost Britain's economic growth in 2025 and 2026 by just 0.1
percentage point each year.
Economists polled by Reuters last month
expected the economy would grow by 1.2% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026, less than
half its pace in the 10 years before 2007.
But in some ways Labour is inheriting an
economy that is turning a corner, a point Sunak tried in vain to sell to
voters.
After a recession in 2023, a recovery is
under way and high inflation has now abated, allowing the Bank of England to
start cutting interest rates possibly as soon as next month. Business and
consumer confidence are on the rise.
Starmer says - and many business leaders
agree - that political stability will help attract investment to Britain after
a turbulent eight years in which the country was run by five different
Conservative prime ministers.
Investors are already warming to the UK's
lower risk profile in the light of rising populism in France and the United
States.
Laura Foll, a portfolio manager at Janus
Henderson Investors, linked a recent out-performance of UK shares to that shift
in perception. ""Relatively, the UK, from a political standpoint, is
looking in far better shape,"" she said.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/mistaken-identity-dci-apologizes-for-wrongly-accusing-preacher-of-protest-violence-n345171,"Mistaken identity: DCI apologizes for wrongly accusing preacher of protest violence
According to the directorate, Mr Basweti was cleared on Wednesday after surrendering himself to the Kenyenya DCI offices and recording a statement.
According to the detectives, Basweti denied taking part in the occupy parliament protests last week, telling the police that his widely shared photo was taken earlier on June 10, 2024, when he visited on the invitation of his MP, Hon. Silvanus Osoro.
""The DCI has since confirmed that Mr Dennis Basweti's narrative is true, and has reached out to him with an apology, further commending him for believing in the DCI's pledge to conducting investigations thoroughly and fairly,"" the directorate said in a Wednesday statement.
According to MP Osoro, Mr Basweti, a pastor, paid him a visit in parliament and took a photo, which he later posted on Facebook.
According to the MP, the photos were downloaded on the day of the protests and passed off as photos from the parliament breach.
The latest development comes just a day after the DCI urged members of the public to provide information that could lead to the arrest of a few people caught on CCTV engaging in criminal activity during the anti-tax protests.
The detectives released a list of 38 people, believed to have been behind a spate of looting, theft and a historic breach of the Kenyan parliament.
The protests on Tuesday, June 25, and July 2 saw the worst acts of vandalism, mugging, and torching of business premises and vehicles in major cities such as Nairobi, Mombasa, and Kisii.
While revealing the identities of the 38 suspects, the DCI urged the public to provide information that could lead to their arrest via the Fichua Kwa DCI hotline number 0800-7222-03.
Information can also be relayed via police hotline number 999, 911 or 112, the DCI said.
“The individuals whose images/photos appear below are wanted by the police for their unlawful activities during the anti-Finance Bill 2024 demonstrations. We therefore advise them to report to the nearest police station for further police action,” DCI said.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/no-funds-lost-at-hustler-fund-we-can-account-for-every-coin-cs-chelugui-n345545,"No funds lost at Hustler Fund, we can account for every coin - CS Chelugui
Cooperatives and MSMEs Cabinet Secretary Simon
Chelugui now says no funds have so far been lost from President William Ruto's
flagship financial credit fund, the Hustler Fund.
The remarks come after Auditor General Dr.
Nancy Gathungu flagged inconsistencies and a perceived lack of transparency and
accountability in the government's implementation and management of the credit
fund.
Speaking on Citizen TV's ‘The Explainer’ show
on Tuesday, Chelugui addressed concerns raised by the Auditor General,
emphasising that the integrity of the Hustler Fund remains intact.
He pointed out initial concerns raised by the
Auditor General in a letter issued in June 2023, stressing that all the issues
have been thoroughly addressed and clarified.
""As we speak, the fund is safe and sound
and secure and we can account for every shilling. No funds have been lost and
whatever management issues raised by the Auditor General have since then been
addressed corrected and aligned,"" said Chelugui.
""The Auditor General gave us a
management letter raising a number of issues. That was in June 2023; we went
through those questions, we clarified those issues. The only challenge that we
faced was delay in submission of that report because we were very low on staff
but since then we have addressed all those issues and we are waiting for the
Auditor General to come back and verify the system.""
The CS added that the Hustler Fund has been
instrumental in rehabilitating 8 million Kenyans previously listed with Credit
Reference Bureaus (CRBs).
""Hustler Fund was a government
intervention to address market failure. Remember we had so many digital lending
organisations that were charging exorbitant rates. Hustler Fund is an initiative
to correct that,"" he said.
""As I speak today; we have done very
wonderful. We have been able to rehabilitate 8 million Kenyans who are listed
with CRBs and to date we have onboarded over 23 million Kenyans, where 18
million have borrowed.""
The Auditor General's report attributed the
issues at Hustler Fund to errors in data extraction, understaffing within the Secretariat
during the fund's establishment, and errors in notes numbering.
Dr. Gathungu issued a disclaimer opinion,
citing inconsistencies in the management of the fund.
She highlighted that the Hustler Fund management
failed to provide financial statements for audit review, which prevented
verification of the source and authenticity of the balances.
This omission underscored significant
shortcomings in the fund's transparency and accountability measures.
In her detailed report, the Auditor General
pointed to doubts surrounding the recovery process from exchange transactions.
Her analysis revealed that 17,855,858
beneficiaries applied for loans, amounting to a total disbursement of
Ksh.32,015,962,276.
However, a substantial balance of
Ksh.10,950,075,614 remained unpaid as of June 2023, including interest
receivable and loans outstanding.
Dr. Gathungu also conducted a review of
balances across multiple bank accounts and mobile network operators linked to
the fund.
She found that Ksh.259,026,553 held by
service providers could not be confirmed due to inadequate documentation
provided by the fund's management.
Additionally, the Auditor General noted
discrepancies in the disclosure of bank account signatories and their specimen
signatures, which were essential for the audit review process.
These lapses further compounded the
challenges in validating the financial activities of the Hustler Fund.
Further scrutiny revealed that the fund
exceeded its set limits in loan disbursements. Dr. Gathungu identified 238,707
cases where loans totaling Ksh.420,312,323 were issued, surpassing the initial
limit by Ksh.219,615,242.
Among these recipients were 5,070 individuals
who were ineligible for loans under the fund's guidelines.
The report also detailed instances where
11,213 borrowers received additional loans totaling Ksh.161,931,703 before
fully repaying their previous obligations.
Furthermore, Dr. Gathungu flagged 129,315
closed accounts holding Ksh.81,622,289, where loan repayments could not be
traced, indicating inadequate tracking and accountability measures.
Additionally, the Auditor General identified
867 instances of duplicate loan identity numbers, which processed 1,978 loans
amounting to Ksh.477,928.

He appeared to be responding to Nominated Senator Tabitha Mutinda, who had proposed scrapping the fund as part of the government's austerity measures.
She believes that if members of the national assembly agree to do away with the kitty, the country's current economic situation will improve.
“MPs should agree to the scrapping of NG-CDF once they return from recess. The MPs must demonstrate leadership and sanction CDF removal. We will solve majority of our problems if we get rid of CDF,” The Senator said during a KBC Channel 1 TV interview Tuesday morning
She insists that national and county governments handle development-related functions, while MPs should focus on legislative functions.
“Let development be handled at the National and County level. We want to hear MPs both from the Majority and Minority sides coming out and declaring support for the abolition of CDF. This is what Gen Z who are on the streets want to hear. If we do that, we are okay,” she reiterated, stating that money budgeted for CDF can be channeled towards debt repayment.
Speaking at Kiangima ACK Church after the Sunday service, Mukunji stated that the NGCDF's contributions to rural development are enormous, and that withdrawing the fund would jeopardise many people's livelihoods.
""Mimi najua wananchi wa hapa Manyatta wanaweza sema vile hii pesa imefanya kazi hapa,"" he said.
""Hapa tuko ni shule ya Kiangima, walikuwa na shida ya sanitation wakati wa floods, sahii tumwajengea unit mpya ya choo.""
According to the MP, the Senate already has a full in-tray of overseeing county governments and cannot claim to oversee the National Assembly.
""Siasa ni mzuri lakini naomba rafiki zetu pale Senate, Senate does not oversight the National Assembly,"" he said ""Infact wako na kazi mingi sana ya kuangalia mambo ya 47 counties.""
Mukuni also implored President Ruto to reconsider his directive on harambees, stating that medical Harambe's are critical in supporting the less fortunate in the community.

He was also a recipient of the Elder of the Golden Heart of Kenya award which is conferred to statesmen.
Among his achievements include developing the expansive open-air Gikomba Market in Kamukunji Constituency during his tenure. He was also instrumental in establishing the jua kali business sector in Shauri Moyo. During first president Jomo Kenyatta’s era, Maina was involved in settling thousands of landless citizens in his role as the Director of Settlement.
He joined active politics in November 1969 by-elections in Kamukunji which was occasioned by Tom Mboya’s assassination.
One of his notable speeches in parliament was in 1973 when he advocated for free primary education in Kenya, something that would be realised 30 years later.
He also served in former president Daniel Moi’s regime as he was appointed as the chairman of Kenya Airways in 1979 before receiving a cabinet position as the Minister for Tourism and Wildlife four years later.
In 1990, he was expelled from then-ruling party KANU for advocating for multi-party politics. Thereafter, he was arrested, interrogated and held at Lang’ata Police Station for three days before being taken to court but no charges were preferred against him.
Maina joined Opposition politics and joined Kenneth Matiba’s Ford Asili faction whereby they unsuccessfully sought to eject Moi from power in the 1992 General Election.
He later took over the Kenya National Congress party as a third party seeking to re-establish himself with the people but was unable to overcome the influence of KANU and Ford party.
Following his exit from politics, he held the position as director of Carbacid Investment for 48 years before exiting in 2018.

Published on: July 10, 2024 09:11 (EAT)
Manchester United recorded a net loss of £71.4 million ($91.4 million) between January and March this year, the club's latest financial results revealed on Wednesday.
United's losses includes £30.3 million in exceptional costs related to the sale of 27.7 per cent of the club to Jim Ratcliffe, including consultancy fees owed to the American firm Raine.
The significant deficit compares unfavourably to losses of £5.6 million for the same three-month period last year.
United's failure to progress from the Champions League group stage will have played a part in the increased losses last season.
The club are reportedly confident improved ownership and management structures are now in place to deliver better recruitment in the future, while maintaining their commercial resilience.
Dan Ashworth recently joined United from Newcastle as their new sporting director, while Omar Berrada begins work as the club's new chief executive this week.
While Ratcliffe's arrival came at a financial cost to United, the British billionaire is committed to investing over £200 million in developing the club's infrastructure, including upgrades for the Carrington training complex.
United are believed to be confident of complying with the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules (PSR) for the assessment period ending with the 2023-24 season.
The PSR allow for losses of up to £105 million over a three-season assessment period.
They will remain in place next season, with new financial rules set to be adopted for the 2025-26 season.
United's total operating expenses were up 15 per cent on the equivalent quarter last year to £203.7 million, which included £91.2 million in employee costs, reflecting investment in the first-team squad.
Amortisation costs related to the payment of transfer fees over the course of players' contracts reached £46.3 million, up by £3.4 million on the same quarter last year.
Revenue was down 20 per cent compared to the same period last season, which the club attributed to playing nine fewer home matches.
The accounts confirmed plans for a redundancy programme which could lead to around 250 jobs being lost across the club.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/i-dont-want-it-say-no-senator-sifuna-mp-babu-owino-protest-salary-increment-for-state-officers-n345111,"'I don't want it, Say NO!' Senator Sifuna, MP Babu Owino protest salary increment for State officers
SRC's announcement which came amid public rage over unsavoury taxes and the cry to cut on public expenditure will see MPs and Cabinet Secretaries (CSs) be among those earning millions of shillings in enhanced salaries and allowances.
Starting July 1, 2024, CSs will be earning Ksh.990,000 from Ksh.957,000 alongside other allowances, Principal Secretaries (PSs) will now bag Ksh.819,844 up from Ksh.792,519
Speakers Moses Wetangula (National Assembly) and Amason Kingi (Senate) will both enjoy a hefty perk from Ksh.1.1 million to Ksh.1.2 million.
Governors will take home Ksh.990,000 from Ksh.957,000 as all the 349 MPs and 67 senators from Ksh.725,502 to ksh.739,600.
Taking to X on Wednesday, Sifuna said that despite the reports being a ""bit of outrage hunting"" he will still not accept the Ksh.14,000 salary increment on his salary.
""I didn’t ask for it. I don’t need it. It’s still money, in a country where many have no income, but for perspective, I pay close to 300k in income tax every month,"" he wrote.
""I will not fight for 14k extra when the whole country is saying we need to lessen taxpayer burden. I don’t want this 14k. Ikae.""
On his part, MP Owino said that the move is ill-informed since the nation is grappling with a heavy financial crisis and giving an advantage to state officers will heighten outrage.
""MPs and other state officers should not be added even a coin. It's sad to increase salary while Kenyans have no jobs, Kenyans have no capital to start businesses, Kenyans have no money to pay school fees, No money for medication. Say NO to salary increment,"" Owino wrote.
It is however important to note that the gazette notice announcing the increment was published in August 2023, noting that the increment will be spread across two years starting July 1, 2023.
President William Ruto and Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua denied a revision to their salaries and maintained they shall remain at Ksh.1,443, 750 and Ksh.1,227,188 respectively.
The only way this can change is if the SRC, and only SRC, de-gazettes the notice because the increment was a product of public participation that was conducted last year.

https://www.citizen.digital/opinion-blogs/analyzing-the-surge-in-femicide-cases-in-kenya-six-months-on-n344727,"Analyzing the surge in femicide cases in Kenya: Six months on
Crime against women has surged in Nairobi, Kenya’s capital, despite stringent measures implemented by enforcement agencies to curb this persistent issue. According to a report by Africa Data Hub, at least 500 women and girls have been murdered since 2016.
On January 14, 2024, Rita Waeni, a 20-year-old student, was brutally murdered and dismembered in a Nairobi apartment. Just days earlier, Starlet Wahu, a 26-year-old Instagram influencer, was found dead in an Airbnb.
These tragic events sparked a protest dubbed “END FEMICIDE NOW,” primarily attended by women demanding an end to these heinous acts. The protests elicited mixed reactions, with blame directed at both the victims and the perpetrators.
Causes of
Femicide
Florence Wacheke, a victim of gender-based violence (GBV), suggested that the rise in femicide cases stems from men's inability to handle heartbreak after relationships end.
“The problem is men. You can’t just wake up and beat up your girlfriend as if she is your wife. When they break up, ladies will be hurt but after a few months when the breakup hits the guys, they will want to beat or kill you,” said Wacheke.
Femicide
Enablers
Dr. Dennis Miano, Director of the Institute of Criminology, Forensics, and Security Studies (ICFoSS) at Dedan Kimathi University of Technology (DeKUT), noted that femicide is on the rise and is not a new phenomenon. He argues that many femicide and android cases go unreported as the media cannot cover every incident.
“As many people deviate from fundamental belief systems such as social institutions like schools and churches, they are defined as criminals,"" said Dr. Miano.
A report by UNODC and UN Women indicates that current and former intimate partners are the most likely perpetrators, accounting for an average of 55% of all intimate partner and family-related killings. Blame has been directed at both the perpetrators and the victims for failing to prioritize their safety. The big question is who is to blame?
“The criminal justice system is the last line of defence in controlling deviant behaviours but cannot exclusively address the root cause of crime in society. Many issues we see are due to over-reliance on the criminal justice system. Family, church, and schools are the main social control institutions,"" said Dr. Miano.
Victim precipitation theory suggests that criminals select their targets based on attractive traits such as gender or sexual orientation. Dr. Miano asserts that vulnerable targets, in the absence of security, can easily be targeted by motivated offenders.
“They may go to a party where they know nobody or with a friend who is equally vulnerable and may end up being victimized,"" said Dr Miano.
Economic
Factors
The harsh economic state has made life unbearable for many, leading them to unorthodox means to make ends meet. Grace and Wacheke caution women to be watchful and avoid the pressures of life, emphasizing the importance of seeking independence by fending for themselves.
“Starlet Wahu was victimized because she was in search of a better life. Let’s look for our money,” said Wacheke.
""I have also felt that pressure in my life; don't give in to it. Stop trying to fit into the lifestyle you see on social media. Don't go to those Airbnbs,” said Okose.
Affected
Age Bracket
Dr Miano highlighted that the majority of femicide victims are young girls, post-teens, who are in the process of self-discovery and thus become exposed. Inappropriate parenting and guardianship can lead to the adoption of socially uncivilized behaviours that manifest in adulthood. Jacqueline Andal, a mother of three, urged parents to devote time and attention to their children to instil good morals and ultimately reduce femicide cases.
""Parents have left the children under the care of house helps whom they do not follow up on how they relate with their young ones,"" said Mrs. Andal.
“Between ages 6 to 13, children tend to be exploratory as they are still trying to understand themselves. With poor parenting, they can become deviant,” said Dr. Miano.
A Facebook study by Dr Miano showed that 39 victims reported being sexually assaulted at a young age, with approximately 13 abused by close family members. He noted that these early experiences are not far removed from ongoing sexual offences.
“From a human growth and developmental stage, these are young children who are still struggling with their identities and are not rational and can therefore be easily swayed,"" said Dr. Miano.
Who is to
Blame?
Society at large is blamed for the rise in criminality, including schools, churches, families, and other social control institutions. Mrs. Andal condemned modern society for being egocentric and neglecting others' needs.
“Gone are the days when neighbours could correct the mistakes of other young ones, but if you try that today, it can be a serious problem. By attempting to correct your neighbour's child’s wrongs, you can be confronted,” said Mrs. Andal.
“While society is expected to nurture individuals to become good persons, it can also nurture bad behaviour when wrongdoings are not promptly corrected,” said Dr Miano.
Solutions
to Femicide
To suppress crime, Dr. Miano proposed that the government focus more on protective mechanisms rather than the reactive mechanisms currently dominant in Kenya.
He called for social control institutions to effectively play their roles in creating a better society. Dr Miano advised women to take precautionary measures, such as sharing their location with friends, especially when going out with strangers, and not going out alone to prioritize their safety.

This year's Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association (KSSSA) nationals will see a new football champion emerge after the reigning champions, St. Anthony Kitale, were unexpectedly eliminated.
St. Anthony Kitale suffered a 2-0 defeat in the Transnzoia County Finals to their neighbours and arch-rivals, St. Joseph's Boys Kitale, in a high-stakes match held at Kipkeikei Secondary this afternoon.
Leading up to the finals, St. Anthony, also known as the 'Solidarity Boys,' defeated St. Paul's Sinoko 1-0 in the quarter-finals and trounced Hilario Secondary 5-0 to secure their spot in the finals against St. Joseph's.
The much-anticipated Transnzoia County Final took place in a charged atmosphere, with both teams eager to break the deadlock and showcase their skills.
The game's turning point came in the 28th minute when Athman Shungu intercepted a cross and fired a shot to the far left, giving St. Joseph's an early lead. This left St. Anthony's defence and goalkeeper stunned, unable to react.
As the first half concluded, St. Joseph's maintained their 1-0 advantage. In the second half, St. Anthony Kitale pressed hard for an equalizer, but St. Joseph's capitalized on a defensive lapse. Rickson Simiyu doubled St. Joseph's lead in the 68th minute, much to the delight of their supporters.
However, the excitement turned to chaos in the 87th minute when fans invaded the pitch, leading to the match's abandonment. Despite the abrupt end, St. Joseph's are now the new County Champions.
Wiyeta Girls High School successfully defended their county championship by defeating St. Joseph Girls 1-0 in the girls' competition. Both Wiyeta and St. Joseph will represent Transnzoia in the regional games set to take place in Bonet from July 16th.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/cs-kindiki-vows-crackdown-on-politicized-crime-amid-reports-of-protest-infiltration-n345082,"CS Kindiki vows crackdown on politicized crime amid reports of protest infiltration
Interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki condemned the violence witnessed during nationwide demonstrations on Tuesday, claiming that it had caused unrest, destroyed public property, and paralysed transportation in some of the counties where protests were held.
The CS stated that some criminals posing as protestors infiltrated peaceful protests in order to loot, destroy property, and cause public unrest.
While referring to the planned demos that will take place throughout the week, CS Kindiki issued a stern warning to the perpetrators, stating that security agencies would prevent such incidents at any cost.
“Notwithstanding the termination of the Bill, hordes of marauding criminal gangs continue to pose a grave danger to the public, riding on announced plans for peaceful protests to disturb public order, commit arson, obstruct public transport and terrorise the people of Kenya with violence,” the CS said.
“The organisers of today’s orgy of violence in parts of Nairobi, Mombasa and several other parts of the Country are reportedly planning to repeat their anarchic chaos and cruel plunder again on Thursday and Sunday this week, and perhaps much more frequently in the future.”
He added: “This reign of terror against the people of Kenya and the impunity of dangerous criminal gangs must end at whatever cost. The Government is determined to stop criminals aiming to terrorise the public and harm Kenya, notwithstanding attempts to politicise crime.”
According to CS Kindiki, there exist unnamed financiers and planners of the protests who he assured the public that they would be brought to book.t
He claimed that the protests were politically motivated and that the government would address the issue.
“Upon completion of the ongoing evidential analysis, the Government assures the public that the planners, executors and financiers of large-scale arson, violent robberies and other felonious crimes will be brought to justice,” he said.
Kindiki also praised law enforcement for their 'professional' handling of the rioters, noting that they remained calm in the face of provocations.
He directed security agencies to thwart any future attempts at violence at any cost, as well as demonstrations to help protect lives and property, while also noting that officers accused of killings would face legal charges.
“The Police continue to act professionally and with restraint in the management of extremely provocative situations that arise in the course of the violent riots. The government commends all law enforcement officers who continue to carry out their challenging mandate of preventing crime and protecting Kenyans' lives and property. Claims of some instances of unlawful conduct by law enforcement officers will be investigated and appropriate action taken,” Kindiki stated.
“Security agencies remain alert to intercept and thwart harm to the public and attempts to attack critical infrastructure and the emblems of our sovereignty.”

Law Society of Kenya President
Faith Odhiambo has expressed grave concerns over recent incidents of police
abductions amid protests against the now-withdrawn Finance Bill 2024.
Speaking on Citizen TV's
JKLive Show, Odhiambo drew parallels to the authoritarian era of the late
former President Daniel Moi, emphasizing instances of police brutality in the
past and condemning the resurgence of such tactics among the ruling
government.
""This
is shocking! I feel like we are going back to the Moi era; the last we heard of
abductions and torture chambers. Our country is singing about and in the region
people are praising Kenyans such abductions coming back. Some of the abducted
persons have been released but others remain unaccounted for,"" she said.
Odhiambo
further called for the immediate release of protesters in detention and
urged accountability from law enforcement authorities, warning against a
regression towards oppressive anti-democratic practices of the past.
""It's
sad because once these people are released they are scared and unable to talk because of what they went through. They can't tell you whether
they were held in a cell, arrested by the DCI or the
NIS and they end up being released in the middle of nowhere,"" she said.
""How
are we going to reconcile when we still have abductions ongoing even after the
demos took place? I think it is high time that we rethink; the Inspector
General of Police must ensure that any persons held must be released
immediately.""
Additionally,
Odhiambo urged Police IG Japhet Koome to resign if he isn't incapable of
enforcing the police's mandate to serve and protect.
""If you are telling us that you are not in control of NPS resign. We don't have any business of keeping you in office if you are incapable of carrying out your mandate. We cannot accept a situation that we are going back to the Moi days.""

https://www.citizen.digital/news/us-death-row-inmate-executed-in-texas-n344832,"US death row inmate executed in Texas
Published on: June 28, 2024 08:44 (EAT)
Death row inmate Ramiro Gonzales.
An American man was executed Wednesday in Texas for the 2001 murder of a woman.
In 2006, Ramiro Gonzales was convicted and sentenced to death for the rape and murder of Bridget Townsend when they both were 18 years old.
Gonzales, now 41, was pronounced dead at 6:50 p.m. local time (23:50 GMT). He was executed via lethal injection.
""To the Townsend family, I’m sorry I can’t articulate, I can’t put into words the pain I have caused y’all, the hurt, what I took away that I cannot give back,"" Gonzales said in his final statement.
In January 2001, Gonzales kidnapped, raped and shot Townsend, who was the girlfriend of his drug dealer.
The case went unsolved for 18 months until Gonzales confessed to the crime while in custody in a separate rape case. He also told authorities where to find Townsend's remains.
Gonzales' attorney had appealed for a stay on his execution to the US Supreme Court, but it was rejected on Wednesday.
Gonzales' execution is the second in Texas so far this year and the eighth in the United States, not counting a canceled execution in Idaho this past February due to a failure to administer the lethal dose by the legal deadline.
The United States carried out 24 executions in 2023, all by lethal injection.
The death penalty has been abolished in 23 of the 50 US states. Six other states -- Arizona, California, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Tennessee -- observe a moratorium on executions.

According to a police report, the driver of the vehicle, a Nissan X-Trail, was speeding towards the Kisiii town general direction when officers from Gesonso Police Station and DCI from Kisii South flagged him down.
The driver, together with his co-driver, slowed down before suddenly speeding off. This prompted the officers to contact their colleagues who mounted a roadblock.
The escaping driver ran over the erected spikes and made a u-turn towards Migori general direction, only for the front tyre of the vehicle to deflate.
Police say the occupants of the vehicle took off, abandoning the vehicle with the engine running.
Upon inspection, police found four sacks of bhang in the vehicle. They towed it to Gesonso Police Station as investigations commence.
The incident comes two days after police officers on the same route nabbed a Toyota Land Cruiser ferrying bhang towards Migori.
One occupant of the vehicle was arrested as the driver escaped into a thicket after he lost control of the vehicle and landed in a ditch.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/lamu-elders-demand-public-apology-from-gachagua-over-remarks-against-noordin-haji-n344877,"Lamu elders demand public apology from Gachagua over remarks against Noordin Haji
Lamu elders now want Deputy President Rigathi
Gachagua to apologise to Kenyans over the recent attacks directed at the National
Intelligence Service (NIS) Director General Noordin Haji.
Led by businessman Mohammed Madhbuti, the
leaders chided the Deputy President accusing him of starting a religious and
tribal attack.
Terming Gachagua’s sentiments as divisive and
undermining to the people of the region at large, the leaders wondered why the
DP had to bad-mouth only Haji publicly, leaving out other security
officials in the country who can also be blamed for the deaths and destruction
caused in the protests.
They thus demanded the DP offer a public
apology, similar to the one he offered to former President Uhuru Kenyatta and
the entire Kenyatta family.
“Why he settled on Noordin and left other
security operators remains a puzzle and we can only second-guess him that he
might have settled on Haji because of his background and the region he comes
from,” they said in a statement read by Madhbuti.
“We demand an apology from the Deputy
President to Kenyans for the utterances made against our son Noordin Haji, just
like the way you publicly apologised to the Kenyatta family.”
The leaders went on to fault the second-in-command
claiming that he has a tendency of undermining leaders from the region.
They referred to past attacks at the Coast
Region DCI boss Smantar Bule and Defence Cabinet Secretary Aden Duale.
“It is also not lost to us that Gachagua
recently also attacked DCI Coast Region boss Smantar Bule and Defence Cabinet
Secretary Aden Duale. As Lamu and Muslim elders, we cannot sit pretty and watch
as Gachagua, the second-in-command and who should show leadership, tears down Noordin,”
noted the statement.
Consequently, the leaders vowed to continue
supporting Haji, underscoring that Gachagua’s attack risks eroding confidence
in government institutions and specific communities.
“We have confidence in him and we shall
support him at all costs. Gachagua should be reminded that discord among
leaders is detrimental and that it is advisable for them to speak with one
voice to effectively address the problem at hand,” they said.
“Continued divergence in their messaging
risks confusing the public and undermining confidence in our collective ability
to tackle the issue. It's crucial that leaders prioritize collaboration and
coherence in their communications to navigate these challenges effectively.”
Gachagua on Wednesday demanded that NIS chief
Haji steps down from his position to pave the way for a more
competent Director General.
Addressing the press in Mombasa, a seemingly
agitated DP blamed the NIS for the current anti-government protests which he
said have led to deaths and destruction.
He said that the NIS failed in its mandate to
inform the Head of State of the situation on the ground before citizens took to
the streets.
“Ruto deserves better, he deserves a DG who
knows what he is doing, who is effective and can analyse situations to keep the
government informed,” said Gachagua.
“It is embarrassing for me as DP that it has
taken protests, deaths, mayhem and destruction for the president to know the
truth yet there is an organization charged with that role.”

The governor's calls come after a trail of attacks meted out to several people who were left nursing serious injuries inflicted on them by the machete-wielding gangs.
Speaking at a function attended by 204 community company directors supported by the county government, Achani said the juvenile gangs took advantage of the countrywide anti-finance bill protests to reign terror on the residents.
""As we continue complaining here young armed men are causing havoc. At first, we were saying we want the Finance Bill to be scrapped and the President did so so now what are we going back to the streets for?"" she posed.
""Talk to one another to reduce the heightening pressure. We are the ones who will suffer and we will not go anywhere else, this is our county.""
She said the county's economy depends on tourism which can be affected without a peaceful environment.
Kwale Chief Finance Officer Alex Onduko said that the county government will conduct annual audits to monitor the companies' growth to bolster Kwale's economy.
""We will be doing annual audits. We will want to know how much turnover these companies have made and monitor their growth. By 2027 we want to see which company has become a 1 million dollar company,"" he said.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/who-is-masoud-pezeshkian-irans-new-president-elect-n345360,"Who is Masoud Pezeshkian, Iran's new president-elect?
Pezeshkian, who defeated hardline Saeed Jalili in Friday's second-round presidential vote, is someone world powers are likely to welcome, hoping he might pursue peaceful ways out of a tense standoff with Iran over its fast-advancing nuclear programme, analysts said.
Pezeshkian managed to win with a constituency - whose core was believed to be the urban middle class and young - that had been widely disillusioned by years of security crackdowns that stifled any public dissent from Islamist orthodoxy.
The 69-year-old cardiac surgeon has pledged to promote a pragmatic foreign policy, ease tensions over now-stalled negotiations with major powers to revive a 2015 nuclear pact and improve prospects for social liberalisation and political pluralism.
Under Iran's dual system of clerical and republican rule, the president cannot usher in any major policy shift on Iran's nuclear programme or support for militia groups across the Middle East, since Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei calls all the shots on top state matters.
However, the president can influence the tone of Iran's policy and he will be closely involved in selecting the successor to Khamenei, now 85.
Pezeshkian is faithful to Iran's theocratic rule with no intention of confronting the powerful security hawks and clerical rulers. In TV debates and interviews, he has promised not to contest Khamenei's policies.
""If I try but fail to fulfil my campaign promises, I would say goodbye to political work and not continue. There is no point in wasting our life and not being able to serve our dear people,"" Pezeshkian said in a video message to voters.
Resurfaced from quiescence after years of political isolation, the reformist camp led by former President Mohammad Khatami endorsed Pezeshkian in the election after the death of hardline President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash in May.
Pezeshkian's views offer a contrast to those of Raisi, a Khamenei protege who tightened enforcement of a law curbing women's dress and took a tough stance in now-moribund negotiations with major powers to revive the nuclear deal.
In 2018, then-U.S. President Donald Trump ditched the pact and reimposed sanctions on Iran. His move prompted Tehran to progressively violate the agreement's nuclear limits.
LIMITED POWER
Pezeshkian has vowed to revive the flagging economy, beset by mismanagement, state corruption and U.S. sanctions.
As the powers of the elected president are circumscribed by those of Khamenei, many Iranians keen for political pluralism at home and an end to Iran's isolation abroad doubt the country's ruling theocracy would let Pezeshkian make major changes even if he tried.
""Pezeshkian might be able to bring some social freedoms. But he will be a weak president because Khamenei and his allies are much more powerful than the president,"" said Sohrab Hosseini, a 45-year-old businessman in Iran's Kish Island.
""I voted for him to prevent Jalili from winning.""
As a lawmaker since 2008, Pezeshkian, an Azeri who supports the rights of fellow ethnic minorities, has criticised the clerical establishment's suppression of political and social dissent.
In 2022, Pezeshkian demanded clarification from authorities about the death of Mahsa Amini, a woman who died in custody after she was arrested for allegedly violating a law restricting women's dress. Her death sparked months of unrest across the country.
""We will respect the hijab law, but there should never be any intrusive or inhumane behaviour toward women,"" Pezeshkian said after casting his vote in the first round.
At a Tehran University meeting last month, responding to a question about students imprisoned on charges linked to 2022-23 unrest, Pezeshkian said ""political prisoners are not within my scope, and if I want to do something, I have no authority"".
During the Iran-Iraq war in 1980s, Pezeshkian, a combatant and physician, was tasked with the deployment of medical teams to the front lines.
He was health minister from 2001-5 in Khatami's second term.
Pezeshkian lost his wife and one of his children in a car accident in 1994. He raised his surviving two sons and a daughter alone, opting to never remarry.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/how-hezbollah-is-trying-to-counter-israels-high-tech-surveillance-n345528,"How Hezbollah is trying to counter Israel's high-tech surveillance
Coded messages. Landline phones. Pagers. Following the killing of senior commanders in targeted Israeli airstrikes, the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group, Hezbollah, has been using some low-tech strategies to try to evade its foe's sophisticated surveillance technology, informed sources told Reuters.
It has also been using its own tech – drones – to study and attack Israel's intelligence gathering capabilities in what Hezbollah's leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, has described as a strategy of ""blinding"" Israel.
The sides have been trading fire since Hezbollah's Palestinian ally in the Gaza Strip, Hamas, went to war with Israel in October.
While the fighting on Lebanon's southern border has remained relatively contained, stepped-up attacks in recent weeks have intensified concern it could spiral into a full-scale war.
Tens of thousands of people have fled both sides of the border. Israeli strikes have killed more than 330 Hezbollah fighters and around 90 civilians in Lebanon, according to Reuters tallies. Israel says attacks from Lebanon have killed 21 soldiers and 10 civilians.
Many of Hezbollah's casualties were killed while participating in the near-daily hostilities, including launching rockets and explosive drones into northern Israel.
Hezbollah has also confirmed the deaths of more than 20 operatives - including three top commanders, members of its elite Radwan special forces unit and intelligence operatives - in targeted strikes away from the frontlines.
Israel's military said it was responding to an unprovoked attack from Hezbollah, which began firing at Israeli targets the day after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement to Reuters that they were striking military targets and taking ""feasible precautions in order to mitigate harm to civilians.""
""The success of these efforts hinges on the IDF's ability to gather thorough and precise intelligence on Hezbollah's forces, its leaders, the organization's terrorist infrastructure, their whereabouts and operations,"" the statement said.
The IDF did not answer questions about its intelligence gathering and Hezbollah's countermeasures, citing ""reasons of intelligence security"".
As domestic pressure builds in Israel over Hezbollah's barrages, the IDF has highlighted its ability to hit the group's operatives across the border.
On a tour of Israel’s Northern Command, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant pointed to pictures of what he said were slain Hezbollah commanders and said 320 “terrorists” had been killed as of May 29, including senior operatives.
Electronic surveillance technology plays a vital role in these strikes. The IDF has said it has security cameras and remote sensing systems trained on areas where Hezbollah operates, and it regularly sends surveillance drones over the border to spy on its adversary.
Israel's electronic eavesdropping - including hacking into cell phones and computers - is also widely regarded as among the world's most sophisticated.
Hezbollah has learned from its losses and adapted its tactics in response, six sources familiar with the group’s operations told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive security matters.
Cell phones, which can be used to track a user's location, have been banned from the battlefield in favour of more old-fashioned communication means, including pagers and couriers who deliver verbal messages in person, two of the sources said.
Hezbollah has also been using a private, fixed-line telecommunications network dating back to the early 2000s, three sources said.
In case conversations are overheard, code words are used for weapons and meeting sites, according to another source familiar with the group's logistics. These are updated nearly daily and delivered to units via couriers, the source said.
""We're facing a battle in which information and technology are essential parts,"" said Qassem Kassir, a Lebanese analyst close to Hezbollah.
""But when you face certain technological advances, you need to go back to the old methods - the phones, the in-person communications … whatever method allows you to circumvent the technology.""
Hezbollah's media office said it had no comment on the sources' assertions.
Security experts say some low-tech countermeasures can be quite effective against high-tech spying.
One of the ways that al Qaeda's late leader, Osama bin Laden, evaded capture for nearly a decade was by disconnecting from the internet and phone services, and using couriers instead.
""The simple act of using a VPN (virtual private network), or better yet, not using a cell phone at all, can make it much harder to find and fix a target,"" said Emily Harding, a former CIA analyst now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington.
""But these countermeasures also make Hezbollah's leadership far less effective at communicating rapidly with their troops.""
Hezbollah and Lebanese security officials believe Israel has also been tapping local informants as it zeroes in on targets.
Lebanon's economic crisis and rivalries between political factions have created opportunities for Israeli recruiters, but not all informants realize who they are speaking with, three sources said.
On Nov. 22, a woman from south Lebanon received a call on her cell phone from a person claiming to be a local official, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the incident.
Speaking in flawless Arabic, the caller asked whether the family was home, the sources said. No, the woman replied, explaining they had travelled to eastern Lebanon.
Minutes later, a missile slammed into the woman's home in the village of Beit Yahoun, killing five Hezbollah fighters including Abbas Raad, the son of a senior Hezbollah lawmaker and a Radwan member, the sources said.
Hezbollah believes Israel had tracked the fighters to the location and placed the call to confirm whether there were civilians present before launching the strike, they told Reuters without disclosing further details.
Israel's military said at the time that it struck a number of Hezbollah targets that day, including a ""terrorist cell"".
Within weeks, Hezbollah was publicly warning supporters via the affiliated Al-Nour radio station not to trust cold callers claiming to be local officials or aid workers, saying Israelis were impersonating them to identify houses being used by Hezbollah.
It was the first of a series of strikes targetting key Hezbollah operatives in Lebanon. Others killed include Wissam al-Tawil, Taleb Abdallah and Mohammed Nasser, commanders who played leading roles directing Hezbollah's operations in the south.
Saleh al-Arouri, deputy head of Hamas, was also killed while attending a meeting in the capital, Beirut.
Hezbollah began suspecting that Israel was targeting its fighters by tracking their cell phones and monitoring video feeds from security cameras installed on buildings in border communities, two sources familiar with the group's thinking and a Lebanese intelligence official told Reuters.
On Dec. 28, Hezbollah urged southern residents in a statement distributed via its Telegram channel to disconnect any security cameras they own from the internet.
By early February, another directive had been issued to Hezbollah's fighters: no mobile phones anywhere near the battlefield.
""Today, if anyone is found with their phone on the front, he is kicked out of Hezbollah,"" said a senior Lebanese source familiar with the group’s operations.
Three other sources confirmed the order. Fighters began leaving their phones behind when they carried out operations, one told Reuters.
Another, the Lebanese intelligence official, said Hezbollah would sometimes perform surprise checks on field units to see if members had phones on them.
Even in Beirut, senior Hezbollah politicians avoid bringing phones with them to meetings, two other sources said.
In a televised speech on Feb. 13, Nasrallah warned supporters that their phones were more dangerous than Israeli spies, saying they should break, bury or lock them in an iron box.
Hezbollah has also taken steps to secure its private telephone network following a suspected breach by Israel, according to a former Lebanese security official and two other sources familiar with Hezbollah's operations.
The vast network, allegedly financed by Iran, was set up around two decades ago with fibre optic cables extending from Hezbollah's strongholds in Beirut's southern suburbs to towns in south Lebanon and east into the Bekaa Valley, according to government officials at the time.
The sources declined to say when or how it had been penetrated. But they said Hezbollah telecommunications specialists were breaking it into smaller networks to limit the damage if it is breached again.
""We often change our landline networks and switch them up, so that we can outrun the hacking and infiltration,"" the senior source told Reuters.
The group has also been touting its ability to collect its own intelligence on enemy targets and attack Israel's surveillance installations using its arsenal of small, homemade, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
On June 18, Hezbollah published a nine-minute excerpt of what it said was video gathered by its surveillance aircraft over the Israeli city of Haifa, including military installations and port facilities.
The Israeli Air Force said air defense systems had detected the drone, but a decision was made not to intercept it because it had no offensive capabilities, and doing so could endanger residents.
Another video released by Hezbollah included aerial pictures it said it had collected of a massive Israeli observation balloon known as Sky Dew on the day before it was hit in a May 15 drone attack.
Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the images. But IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said at the time that the airship, used to detect incoming rockets, was hit while on the ground at a military base in northern Israel.
He said there were no casualties and no impact on the military’s ""aerial situational awareness capability"" in the area.
Hezbollah says it has also shot down or taken control of half a dozen Israeli surveillance drones, including Hermes 450, Hermes 900 and SkyLark UAVs. Hezbollah operatives disassemble the drones to study their components, according to two of the sources.
Israel has confirmed that five air force drones were downed by surface-to-air missiles while operating over Lebanon.
However, the IDF said Hezbollah's declarations ""should be noted with reservation,"" saying the group aims to instil fear in Israelis.
Nicholas Blanford, a Beirut-based security consultant who has written a history of Hezbollah, said the group's ""awareness and wariness"" of security breaches was at an all-time high.
""Hezbollah has had to tighten up its security far more than it needed to do in earlier conflicts,"" he told Reuters.
Israel retains a technological advantage, however, Blanford said.
On the afternoon of July 3, a car driving through a Lebanese coastal village more than 20 km (12 miles) north of the Israeli border burst into flames, witnesses said.
The Israeli military said it had eliminated Nasser, who it said commanded a unit that is attacking Israel from southwestern Lebanon.
His death came less than a month after the strike that killed Abdallah, who commanded operations in the central region of the southern border strip.
Hezbollah acknowledging both killings and in response launched some of its biggest barrages to date into northern Israel.

In a statement by LSK Secretary Florence Muturi, the LSK noted that the task force is unconstitutional since the mandate to conduct public audits rests with the office of the Auditor General.
LSK pointed out the Auditor General is required by law to audit the public debt within six months after the end of each financial year.
He is also mandated to audit the accounts of the national and county governments, all courts, every commission and independent office established by the Constitution, the National Assembly, the Senate and the county assemblies and the accounts of political parties funded by public funds.
Further, the Office on Public Debt Management, headed by a Director-General at the Treasury and funded by public money, is required to provide details of public debt to the Auditor General for forensic audit.
The legal body explained that the president should not usurp the Constitution by appointing people to perform duties that already lie within existing public offices.
""The Council of the Law Society of Kenya has thus resolved that neither our president nor any of our members shall take up appointments or participate in the said taskforce,"" LSK said.
""The LSK, under its statutory mandate, advises the President to refrain from usurping the Constitutional powers of the Auditor-General through Executive Orders and allow the Auditor-General to perform her constitutional duties.""
Ruto had appointed a four-member team to audit the country's public debt and release a report within 90 days.
The team is to be chaired by Nancy Onyango and deputised by Professor Luis Franceschi.
Other members include Shammah Kiteme, Vincent Kimosop and Philip Kaikai.

Published on: June 28, 2024 10:59 (EAT)
(From L to R) Italy's goalkeeper #12 Guglielmo Vicario, Italy's defender #13 Matteo Darmian, Italy's defender #05 Riccardo Calafiori, Italy's goalkeeper #01 Gianluigi Donnarumma, Italy's forward #20 Mattia Zaccagni, Italy's midfielder #16 Bryan Christante, Italy's forward #09 Gianluca Scamacca, Italy's defender #02 Giovanni Di Lorenzo and Italy's midfielder #07 Davide Frattesi celebrate after winning the UEFA Euro 2024 Group B football match between Italy and Albania at the BVB Stadion in Dortmund on June 15, 2024. (Photo by FRANCK FIFE / AFP)
Gianluigi Donnarumma has reprised his role as European Championship hero for Italy as he leads the uncertain holders into their Euro 2024 last 16 clash with Switzerland.
Named player of the tournament at the last Euros, Donnarumma has a decent claim to have been the best player of this year's group stage in Germany, pulling off save after save as the Italians stumbled towards qualification from Group B.
The Azzurri skipper's last-gasp save stopped Rey Manaj snatching an undeserved draw for Albania in Italy's opening match, a 2-1 win which was crucial to the champions getting out of the group.
Donnarumma then made sure that Spain didn't beat Italy by a cricket score in a humbling 1-0 defeat and starred again in the dramatic 1-1 draw with Croatia which his team were losing until the final few seconds of stoppage time.
The 25-year-old pulled off a couple of miracle stops before Luka Modric finally forced Croatia into the lead, just moments after the Real Madrid midfielder watched Donnarumma save his penalty.
And the giant 'keeper's ability at stopping spot-kicks will be a huge plus in the knockouts, especially for a team which has trouble creating chances, much less putting them away.
Donnarumma's top-drawer performances in Germany comes after criticism over the past season with Paris Saint-Germain, but he is revelling in leading Italy at a major tournament after coach Luciano Spalletti resisted calls to replace him with Tottenham Hotspur's Guglielmo Vicario.
""It's difficult to explain what it means to wear this shirt, come here and know that 60 million Italians are watching at home,"" said Donnarumma before the Croatia match.
""It means even more when you're wearing the captain's armband.""
Donnarumma will be of even more importance on Saturday due to the absence of centre-back Riccardo Calafiori, whose ability to bring the ball out of defence was key to Mattia Zaccagni's crucial equaliser against Croatia.
Calafiori is suspended for picking up a second booking of the group phase against Croatia, meaning that one of Gianluca Mancini or Alessandro Buongiorno could take his place in the heart of Italy defence.
At 28, and with 12 caps, Roma defender Mancini is the more senior defender but Buongiorno's style of play and defending better replicates Calafiori as Mancini is more of a traditional, hard-nosed centre-back.
""I don't know if I'm going to play, all I can do is give my best in training and make the coach's decision as difficult as possible,"" said Buongiorno on Thursday.
Italy have also benefitted from being on the opposite side of the knockout draw to most of the big hitters, with only raggedy pair England and the Netherlands among the tournament heavyweights they could meet before the final.
However based on their performances so far at this Euros Italy won't strike fear into the heart of anyone, even if the Azzurri have a remarkable ability to drag themselves into contention no matter how difficult the circumstances.
""We've realised that there are no easy games. You can see these big teams struggle with their style of play and getting results,"" added Buongiorno.
""Having seen their matches tells us that we can't underestimate anyone, because every team is good and can hurt you if you're not at your best.""
Italy will face either Slovakia or England, vanquished finalists three years ago, in Duesseldorf a week on Saturday if they see off the Swiss.

Two families are seeking justice
after their kin were killed during the anti-Finance Bill 2024 protests that
rocked the city of Mombasa.
Denis Otieno was found to have been shot
three times, but his family maintains that he was not among the protesters on
the day he died.
For more than 15 days the family has been
searching for him. His mother Coleta Achieng and uncle George Omondi made calls
with no response, only to receive a message of their son’s death through social
media.
This prompted them to travel from Kitale to Mombasa,
where they claim they found his body with three bullet wounds.
“Mtoto amepigwa
risasi tatu, hata tunashindwa risasi moja hainge muuwa? Na serikali kweli kweli
hakuna hatua inaweza chukuwa,” lamented Mr. Omondi.
The family maintains that the 26-year-old was
not among the demonstrators on the day he met his death. Denis arrived in Mombasa
less than a year ago after he secured employment in one of the companies in the
Coastal town.
“Serikali naomba
haki, mtoto aliuwawa kama kuku, mtoto hakuwa kwa maandamano... alikuwa ameenda
nyumbani akapigwa risasi,” pleaded his mother Ms. Achieng.
At the same hospital, the family of Joash Ombati
is mourning. Their son was shot dead by police.
The family arrived from Kisii and identified
the body where a bullet was recovered from his lifeless body.
The deceased’s wife
Lilian Ombati said: “Aliniacha nyumbani akija kutafutia familia… nimeambiwa
amepigwa risasi. Sahii watoto sijui wataishi aje, sina mbele wala nyuma, babake
ndio tegemeo kwa hiyo nyumba.”
Mathias Shipeta, a Rapid
Response Officer at Haki Afrika, noted: “IPOA wamechukua risasi moja
iliopatikana kwa mwili wa marehemu na itasaidia kwa uchunguzi.”
The security apparatus in Mombasa has since declined
to comment on the matter.
The families are now calling on President
William Ruto to ensure that all families that lost their loved ones are compensated
and justice delivered.

Dated April 2024, the report highlighted how the 47 county governments used the allocated budgets.
Out of the Ksh.658 million, the County Executive, comprising the Governor's office and his deputy, utilised Ksh.589.35 million while Ksh.69.48 million was used by the County Assembly.
The highest amount the county executive used for foreign travel was a trip to Morocco to attend the proactive management program. The trip, which lasted 14 days, consisted of 19 officers and used Ksh.37 million.
They also utilised Ksh.19 million to travel to Canada for a seminar on leadership management. A personal branding summit in Dubai amounted to Ksh.8 million.
In total, over ten trips were taken from August 2023 to March 2024.
The Nairobi MCAs did not provide information on foreign travel despite the COB approving 12 foreign travel requests over the reported period.
In terms of local travel, the county executive utilised Ksh.322 million while the MCAs used Ksh.244 million.
For budget allocation, the county set aside over Ksh.407 million for Risk Management Framework projects, while Ksh.198 million was allocated to construction of ten centralised kitchens and 100 serving sheds in schools.
Construction of access roads in Dandora amounted to Ksh.65 million, while Ksh.4 million was set aside for the refurbishment of offices at City Hall.
This comes amid calls by the public for the government to reduce its public expenditure to reflect the country's economic status.
Recently, Meru Governor was called out for using Ksh.900 million on foreign travel. She, however, refuted the claims and alleged that the COB had erred in its report, insisting that she utilised Ksh.900,000.

President William Ruto has announced a raft
of austerity measures across various government agencies to align the country’s
budgetary expenditure to the implications of the withdrawn Finance Bill, 2024.
President Ruto, addressing the nation from
State House in Nairobi on Friday afternoon, announced that at least 47
government bodies with almost similar mandates will now be dissolved and their staff
absorbed into parent ministries.
This, he said, will enable the government to
recoup funds previously used for their operational and maintenance expenses.
Ruto also said that the decision to fill the
positions of Chief Administrative Secretary (CAS) effectively stands suspended,
further that the number of advisers attached to the Executive will be slashed
by 50 per cent.
“Budget lines providing for the operations of
the First Lady, the Spouse of the Deputy President and Prime Cabinet Secretary
will be removed,” he announced.
“Similarly, budget provisions for
confidential budgets in various Executive offices including my own office have
been removed, and the budget for the renovations across government reduced by
50 per cent.”
Ruto added: “Henceforth, public servants who
attain the retirement age of 60 shall be required to immediately proceed on
retirement with no extensions to their tenure of service whatsoever.”
The Head of State went ahead to halt the purchase
of new government motor vehicles for 12 months, providing an exception only to security
agencies, while also stating that a new framework for the transportation of public
officers will be developed.
“All non-essential travel by State and public
officers is hereby suspended. No State officer or public servant shall
participate in harambees going forward,” he added.
“The Attorney General is hereby directed to
prepare and submit legislation to this effect and develop a mechanism for
structured and transparent contributions for public, charitable and
philanthropic purposes.”
And while insider sources had previously
intimated the possibility of a Cabinet reshuffle, the President concluded his
speech by saying; “These measures will be followed by changes in government
that I will be making shortly.”

The Milimani High Court
has ordered the immediate and unconditional release of protesters reportedly arrested
and abducted by law enforcement agencies in the wake of the anti-finance bill demonstrations.
This follows a petition
filed by John Githiaka, Brian Ngula and 11 others against the National
Intelligence Service (NIS) and the National Police Service (NPS) which they
accused of orchestrating the abductions.
In his ruling, Justice E.C. Mwita certified the application as urgent

violations of constitutional rights enshrined in the Bill of Rights.
""It is over 24 hours since the abductions complained of took place, an order is hereby
issued directing the respondents, their agents and or servants, to immediately
and unconditionally release the 2nd to 13th petitioners, pending the hearing
and determination of this application,"" Mwita ordered.
He likewise issued
conservatory orders barring the NIS and NPS from arresting the aforesaid
protestors upon their release and any other Kenyans peacefully partaking in anti-finance
bill demonstrations nationwide.
""An Interim Conservatory order is hereby issued
restraining the respondents, their agents and or servants from abducting the
2nd to 13th once released, and or any other person who is peacefully protesting

https://www.citizen.digital/news/tear-gas-rocks-and-looting-kenya-police-and-protesters-clash-n345083,"Tear gas, rocks, and looting: Kenya police and protesters clash
Crowds in Kenya's capital Nairobi lobbed rocks and looted
businesses as police officers fired tear gas in scattered violence during fresh
anti-government protests Tuesday following last month's deadly demonstrations.
Activists have continued to agitate loudly online against
President William Ruto, despite his decision last week to withdraw a
controversial finance bill that triggered what he has branded
""treasonous"" protests by Gen-Z Kenyans.
The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR) said
on Monday that 39 people had been killed and 361 injured during two weeks of
protests -- with the worst violence occurring in Nairobi last Tuesday -- and
condemned the use of force against demonstrators as ""excessive and
disproportionate"".
It is the most serious crisis to confront Ruto since he took
office in September 2022 in a nation often considered a beacon of stability in
a turbulent region.
After last week's bloody chaos, young Kenyans, whose protest
movement has no official leaders, called for a new day of peaceful action on
Tuesday, with leaflets posted online using the hashtag ""RutoMustGo"".
But Nairobi's central business district -- the focus of
previous rallies -- saw sporadic confrontations on Tuesday afternoon. Police
fired tear gas and used water cannons against groups of stone-throwing men, some
of who lit bonfires on deserted roads.
""Goons have infiltrated,"" prominent Gen-Z
protester Hanifa Adan posted on X, followed by a string of broken heart emojis.
AFP journalists reported seeing a number of arrests and
injuries, although there are no official figures.
Several coffins, some covered with the national flag, were
placed on roads by protesters, images on Kenyan television showed, before they
were removed by officers.
Local politician John Kwenya told AFP that business owners
shuttering their shops were ""scared"" of the ""goons"".
""This is economic sabotage,"" said Kwenya, a member
of the Nairobi city county assembly.
Elsewhere in the country, local television broadcast images
of larger marches in the coastal opposition stronghold of Mombasa, where a
number of cars were torched, and Kenyan media shared video of at least one shop
being vandalised.
At a peaceful march in the lakeside city of Kisumu in
western Kenya, demonstrator Allan Odhiambo, 26, told AFP he had lost hope in
Ruto.
""We promised a peaceful protest and that is what we
have done, but Ruto must go,"" he said, citing a slogan that has become a
popular hashtag.
- 'We want justice' -
On Tuesday last week, largely peaceful anti-tax rallies
descended into deadly chaos when lawmakers passed the finance bill -- a deeply
unpopular move among Kenyans already suffering a cost of living crisis.
After the announcement of the vote, crowds ransacked the
partly ablaze parliament complex in central Nairobi as police fired live
bullets at protesters.
Ruto then decided to scrap the tax legislation and has
appealed for dialogue with young Kenyans, but his actions appear not to have
appeased his critics.
In a television interview on Sunday, he defended his decision
to call in the armed forces to tackle unrest and insisted he did not have
""blood on my hands"".
In the Rift Valley town of Nakuru on Tuesday, protesters
marched peacefully, with some carrying pictures of three who lost their lives
in last week's demonstrations.
""We want justice for innocent Kenyans killed by police
during the protests that were peaceful,"" Mary Lynn Wangui told AFP.
""Ruto has not offered an apology,"" said the
24-year-old, as she waved a placard declaring: ""RutoMustGo"".
The state-funded KNCHR said Monday that in the previous
protests there had been 32 cases of ""enforced or involuntary
disappearances"" and 627 arrests of protesters.
""The Commission continues to condemn in the strongest
terms possible the unwarranted violence and force that was inflicted on
protesters, medical personnel, lawyers, journalists and on safe spaces such as
churches, medical emergency centres and ambulances,"" it said.
Kenya's cash-strapped government said previously that the
tax increases were necessary to fill its coffers and service a huge public debt
of some 10 trillion shillings ($78 billion), or about 70 percent of GDP.
In Sunday's interview, Ruto warned that the government would
have to borrow another $7.7 billion because of the decision to drop the finance
bill.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/biden-defends-his-mental-acuity-and-physical-stamina-n345348,"Biden defends his mental acuity and physical stamina
""I'm the most qualified person and I know how to get things done,"" Biden told ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos in a 22-minute interview. Earlier Friday he assured a rally of about 300 supporters in the Midwestern political battleground state of Wisconsin, ""I am staying in the race.""
Some Democratic lawmakers in Washington privately – and increasingly publicly – have voiced concerns that Biden, at 81, no longer has the mental and physical capacity to take on Trump over the four months leading to the November 5 election, let alone govern the country over the next four years.
But Biden told Stephanopoulos, ""If the Lord Almighty came down and said, 'Joe, get out of the race,' I’d get out of the race. But the Lord Almighty is not coming down.""
The Democrats' fear that Biden's time in power is nearing the end has mounted since Biden appeared confused and halting during his debate with Trump a week ago, at times losing his train of thought and unable to mount a sustained attack on Trump or consistently defend his 3½-year tenure in office.
""I was exhausted,"" he said of the debate night. ""I was feeling terrible … a bad cold."" He said his poor performance was ""nobody's fault but mine. It was a bad episode.""
But Biden was alert on Friday and answered Stephanopoulos' questions with little hesitation. He was eager to attack Trump.
""Trump is a pathological liar,"" Biden contended, adding for emphasis, ""The man is a congenital liar."" Biden cited news accounts that said Trump had told 28 lies during the 90-minute debate.
Stephanopoulos said Trump turned down a chance to also sit for an interview with ABC.
The news anchor, one of the most prominent journalists in the United States, asked Biden whether he had ever had a neurological test, and Biden responded by saying, ""I get a full neurological test every day,"" dealing with world and domestic issues.
Asked whether he had ever had a cognitive test, the president responded, ""No one has said I need to.""
With Biden's poor debate performance, numerous polls have shown Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, pulling ahead in the contest. After Biden won in 2020, it will be the first time the same two major party candidates have opposed each other in consecutive U.S. presidential elections since 1956.
But Biden took issue with Stephanopoulos' contention that he was falling behind.
""All the pollsters I talk to say it's a toss-up,"" Biden said.
Biden assured his supporters at the rally in Madison, Wisconsin, ""I am running, and I'm going to win again.""
""I beat Donald Trump,"" a forceful Biden said, as the crowd cheered and waved campaign signs. ""I will beat him again.""
Three major U.S. newspapers, The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, have reported in recent days that Biden's mental lapses have become more frequent in recent months, with some Western officials saying they noted his apparent decline at the recent G-7 summit in Italy.
Biden's delivery and sharpness in answering Stephanopoulos' questions were sure to be parsed, not only by Trump and his aides, but by Democrats wondering whether their candidate is up to taking on Trump, who is 78, and himself has sometimes misspoken.
At the rally, Biden played off his own missteps, quoting one of Trump's campaign comments, when Trump said, ""George Washington's army won the revolution by taking control of the airports from the British.""
As the crowd laughed, Biden continued, ""Talk about me misspeaking.""
The White House realized the high stakes of the interview with the ABC anchor. Biden press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that ""millions of Americans"" were expected to watch.
Most Democrats have held fast in their support for Biden and his running mate, Vice President Kamala Harris, but some have been suggesting the party would be better off with Biden dropping out and Harris taking his place as the presidential standard bearer.
The National Democratic Party is holding its quadrennial nominating convention in August, leaving the party little time to settle on its presidential nominee.
At least three Democrats in the House of Representatives have called for Biden to step down as the nominee, with Representative Seth Moulton of Massachusetts expressing his concerns in a Thursday radio interview and joining Representatives Lloyd Doggett of Texas and Raúl Grijalva of Arizona in seeking an alternative.
""President Biden has done enormous service to our country, but now is the time for him to follow in one of our founding fathers', George Washington's, footsteps and step aside to let new leaders rise up and run against Donald Trump,"" Moulton told radio station WBUR.
While not going that far, Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey said in a carefully worded statement Friday that Biden now has a decision to make on ""the best way forward.""
""Over the coming days, I urge him to listen to the American people and carefully evaluate whether he remains our best hope to defeat Donald Trump,"" Healey said. ""Whatever President Biden decides, I am committed to doing everything in my power to defeat Donald Trump.""

Marathon Major in a time of 2 hours 4 minutes 01 seconds and has been selected
to be part of team Kenya, a feat he feels proud of.
“My dream was to represent Kenyan
in the Olympics and having not run a major marathon before, I knew with the
level of competition in Kenya, I had to put in the hard work required to make
sure I am selected to be part of the team,” said Mutiso
The London
marathon winner was named alongside former world record holder Eliud Kipchoge
and Benson Kipruto, and he explained how inspired he was to run alongside
Kipchoge.
“He is a legend who has inspired
many athletes in the world. I wanted to learn from him and be the best that I
can be, and being in the same team with him inspires me a lot,” added Mutiso
The team under
Coaches Amos Korir, Nicholas Koech, and Patrick Sang, with former marathoner
Mary Keitany as the team coordinator, is currently in a residential camp as
they prepare for the upcoming games, and Munyao says they are putting in the
hard work required to make Kenyan shine.
“The training is going well. We are
receiving the best support that we can, and I am sure we are going to have a
successful outing in Paris,” stated the London Marathon champion

https://www.citizen.digital/news/occupy-moh-kmpdu-announces-fresh-strikes-if-intern-doctors-not-posted-n345264,"'Occupy MoH': KMPDU announces fresh strikes if intern doctors not posted
The Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU) has announced plans to occupy the Ministry of Health's premises in Nairobi, effective Monday, July 8, 2024, until all medical interns are posted to health facilities nationwide in line with the 2017 Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).
The CBA was ratified in May following a 56-day nationwide doctors' strike as part of a return-to-work formula (RTWF) inked between the union and the government.
In a statement on Tuesday,
KMPDU Secretary General Davji Atellah highlighted that the union had been holding
a series of meetings with the aim of implementing the return-to-work formula at
Kenyatta National Hospital and the Ministry of Health.
According to Atellah, the internship posting debacle was to be resolved within 60 days as per the 2017 CBA.
""As we all know, the 60 days end on 7th of July 2024.So far we are in agreement with Ministry of Health that interns must be posted as per CBA 2017 before the lapse of the 60-day negotiation window as per our Return to Work Formula. The Ministry of Health is to have an engagement with Treasury before our final meeting set for Thursday, 4th July 2024,"" he said then.
In regards to post-graduate fees for medical interns, Dr. Atellah expressed that the Ministry of Health paid school fees to some of the MMED students but left out others.
""We have agreed that they will share with us this list amounting to Ksh.110 million. All the pending cases will be sorted in time to enable them to sit for examinations: especially those discriminated against by the illegal training committee decision to list some courses as non-priority,"" he said.
Concerning the 1-year contract employment of doctors at KNH, Dr. Atellah noted that the Ministry of Health and the hospital management will by the end of the week come up with a mechanism to expand the establishment that will ensure implementation of RTWF clause 7 on the translation of the 1-year contracts to renewable 3-year contracts.
""Their unfair gross salary of Ksh.120, 000 will also be harmonized to the standard rate of Ksh.300.000,"" he said.
Additionally, the doctors' union boss also chimed in on the remuneration of medical registrars.
""The Cabinet Secretary will write to all Level 6 and 5 hospitals. which offer postgraduate trainings to adhere to the agreed 40 hours a week working hours per registrar. Compensation for any extra hours of service is mandatory as per the agreement,"" he said.
""From industrial action, we get a Return to Work Formula whose implementation requires the commitment of union members and leadership. We are stronger together!""

https://www.citizen.digital/news/transport-cs-murkomen-now-calls-for-lifestyle-audit-of-all-state-officers-n345340,"Transport CS Murkomen now calls for lifestyle audit of all State officers
Roads and Transport Cabinet Secretary
Kipchumba Murkomen wants all public servants and State officers to undergo
lifestyle audits annually in order to curb corruption.
Speaking
on Saturday during the burial of former Principal Secretary Josiah Sang in
Kapkatet, Kericho County, the CS took issue with concerns raised recently
during the anti-government protests on the misappropriation of public resources
and extravagant display of lavish lifestyles by public servants and State
officials.
He
suggested that Members of Parliament should legislate laws where civil servants
are audited before and after assuming public offices to monitor wealth
acquisition.
“Instead
of just saying that this person was a CS yesterday and today he has bought this
and that, why don’t we pass a law in Kenya for lifestyle audit so that every
year after office, we can do a lifestyle audit of every person who is holding
public office, so that it is not just me who is being questioned about the
price of shoes or shirt I am wearing,” said Murkomen.
According
to the CS, the move which is in line with President William Ruto’s recent
directive of the country’s need to curb graft and ensure people live within
their means, will guarantee accountability for public servants.
Murkomen
at the same time supported the call by Kenyans through the recent demonstrations
to have State officers barred from participating in harambees where they’re
accused of misappropriating public funds.
“I
think it is important as a country that we just don’t make mere speeches. We
have agreed that since harambees can bring about corruption, let us put them
aside,” he stated.
The
remarks by the CS come after Kenyans expressed anger over how some State
officials and politicians have been flashing their wealth and living expensive
lifestyles at the expense of taxpayers.
Deputy
President Rigathi Gachagua has since come out to caution elected
and appointed leaders against displaying arrogance and opulence
towards Kenyans, reminding them that they are in different capacities to serve
the people.
He claimed
that leaders' arrogance towards Kenyans is a bad example that continues to
erode trust between them and the people.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/woman-raped-and-beaten-by-french-rugby-players-n345614,"Woman raped and beaten by French rugby players
The two players with the national squad, Hugo Auradou, 20, and Oscar Jegou, 21, were awaiting transfer Wednesday to the city of Mendoza where the sexual violence allegedly took place.
The men were arrested in Buenos Aires on Monday, two days after a test match against Argentina, after the alleged victim was found with injuries consistent with her account of rape.
Lawyer Rafael Cuneo Libarona, who represents the players, told AFP the teammates had admitted to having had sexual relations with the plaintiff but it had been ""consensual sex, and at no time were there signs of violence or anything of that sort.""
The alleged victim's lawyer, Natacha Romano, told local Mendoza media that her client had been ""savagely beaten"" during the attack, with visible injuries to her face, head, ribs and legs.
However, she told Radio Mitre that ""the most serious of these crimes is the sexual assault with carnal access,"" the Argentine legal definition of rape.
According to local media reports, the alleged attack took place Saturday night at the Diplomatic Hotel in Mendoza, where France's players and staff were staying for a Test match as part of a South American tour.
Police sources, who asked not to be named, told AFP that according to testimony, the players met the woman at a bar after Saturday's match, and went with her to the hotel.
She alleges she felt dizzy after a few drinks and was taken by Auradou and Jegou to the hotel where she was raped.
""The main visible blow is a punch to one of her eyes, several blows to the head... to the ribs which are being checked for fractures,"" Romano told the Mendoza Post.
- 'Convincing elements' -
She said the woman had been locked for four hours inside the hotel room where the alleged rape took place.
""Aside from the sexual assault, we are talking about a woman who was savagely beaten,"" Romano told El Sol newspaper.
Mendoza prosecutor Daniela Chaler told LV10 radio Tuesday there were ""convincing elements"" in the statement the woman made and that her injuries are compatible with her version of events, although they were not ""necessarily exclusive"" to sexual assault.
French rugby and sports officials have expressed shock at the allegations while stressing the importance of the players having the opportunity to tell their side of the story.
The French Rugby Federation (FFR), too, said the players have denied any coercion or violence.
""If the facts are true, they are incredibly serious,"" the federation's president Florian Grill told reporters in Argentina while stressing the investigation must be left to take its course.
Once the players arrive in Mendoza, they will undergo questioning and forensic examination, said their lawyer Libarona -- who is the brother of the country's justice minister Mariano Cuneo Libarona.
""We will present evidence on behalf of the players, concrete evidence, and the justice of Mendoza will decide whether or not to free the players,"" the lawyer told AFP.
After the initial questioning, prosecutor Cecilia Bignert will have 24 hours to decide whether or not to charge the players. The deadline can be extended once, by another 24 hours.
If charged, a pre-trial hearing will be held 10 days later to determine whether or not they will await trial in custody or as free men.
- 'Trauma' -
France head coach Fabien Galthie said news of the accusation had been ""a trauma"" for the squad and delegation.
""It's a very difficult time,"" he told reporters Tuesday in Montevideo on the eve of a friendly match against Uruguay on the French team's South American tour.
Part of an FFR delegation remained behind in Argentina with the two accused players.
France's Sports Minister Amelie Oudea-Castera wrote on X on Tuesday: ""If the investigation establishes the alleged facts, they constitute an unspeakable atrocity. Our thoughts are with the victim.""
Auradou and Jegou were in the French side that won last year's Under-20 World Cup in South Africa.
The sentence for sexual assault in Argentina ranges from six to 15 years, according to the penal code. However, this could go up to 20 years in the case of two aggressors.

Speaking to the press in Kisii on Thursday, Manduku accused elected leaders of failing the country's mandate.
He stated that new elections would give Kenyans the opportunity to choose new leaders who would serve them faithfully.
""I want to thank the president for ultimately listening to the people's voice and doing the right thing but more than that I want to state here that as elected leaders we're the problem and I want to ask the president to immediately dissolve National Assembly and call for fresh elections within 90 days,"" he said.
The lawmaker also claimed that President Ruto would rely on international treaty organisations like the African Union, the United Nations, and the East African Community to send nine commissioners to oversee the elections. The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) is not currently properly constituted to conduct elections.
""People will argue that there's no IEBC but remember we're party to many international treaties. We can ask the AU, EAC or UN to send nine commissioners to oversee the elections. The first point would be update the voter register within 30 days and thereafter conduct fresh elections. MPs who barely served two years will be compensated on the remaining term,"" he pointed out.
He urged the Gen Zs to ensure that MPs do not resume Parliament, insisting that the status quo cannot continue at a time when the public has expressed dissatisfaction with the current regime.
""It is not tenable that we can go back to that House which has been desecrated. Article 1 of the Constitution talks about the power belongs to the people. What we saw on Tuesday is that the public came to take back the power. I want to ask Kenyans not to allow MPs to go back to Parliament,"" Manduku noted.
""Yesterday, I saw the president reading a statement and his deputy reading another statement. Two statements that seem to come from different arms of government. It is my considered view that the government has failed in its duties to protect Kenyans. We ask the president to reconstitute the Cabinet and get competent people to work for him.""
Article 261 states that if Parliament fails to carry out its constitutional mandate, the president may dissolve it on the advice of the Chief Justice.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/russian-missiles-kill-37-in-ukraine-gut-kyiv-childrens-hospital-n345471,"Russian missiles kill 37 in Ukraine, gut Kyiv children's hospital
Published on: July 09, 2024 07:30 (EAT)
Russia attacked cities across Ukraine on Monday with a missile barrage that killed more than three dozen people and ripped open a children's hospital in Kyiv, an assault condemned as a ruthless attack on civilians.
Dozens of volunteers including hospital staff and rescue workers dug through debris from the Okhmatdyt paediatric hospital in a desperate search for survivors after the rare day-time bombardment, AFP journalists on the scene saw.
President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia launched dozens of missiles toward five towns and cities in southern and eastern Ukraine as well as the capital.
At least 37 people were killed, including three children, with more than 170 wounded, Zelensky said.
The strikes damaged nearly 100 buildings, including multiple schools and a maternity hospital, he added.
The air force said air defence systems downed 30 projectiles.
""It is necessary to shoot down Russian missiles. It is necessary to destroy the Russian combat aircraft on its bases. It is necessary to take strong steps that will not leave any security deficit,"" Zelensky said ahead of a NATO summit where arming Ukraine's air defences is expected to top the agenda.
Zelensky called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council over the barrage and urged Ukraine's allies to deliver ""a stronger response"" to Russia's attack.
Following the strikes, US President Joe Biden on Monday promised ""new measures"" to boost Ukraine's air defences.
""Together with our allies, we will be announcing new measures to strengthen Ukraine’s air defences to help protect their cities and civilians from Russian strikes,"" Biden said.
UN rights chief Volker Turk condemned the ""abominable"" Russian strikes, while the body's chief Antonio Guterres said attacking medical facilities was ""particularly shocking"", according to his spokesman Stephane Dujarric.
The United States denounced ""another savage missile attack on civilians"", while the European Union slammed Moscow for its ""ruthless"" actions.
France's foreign ministry called the bombardment of a children's hospital ""barbaric"", Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau described the attack as ""abhorrent"" and Japan's government spokesman ""strongly condemned"" the strike.
Kyiv said the children's hospital had been struck by a Russian cruise missile with components produced in NATO member countries and announced a day of mourning in the capital.
Russia hit back claiming the extensive missile damage in Kyiv was caused by Ukrainian air defence systems.
Moscow said its forces had struck their ""intended targets"", which it added were only defence industry and military installations.
Medical staff acted quickly to move patients and personnel to the facility's basement after air raid sirens rang out over Kyiv on Monday.
""For some reason, we always thought that Okhmatdyt was protected,"" said Nina, a 68-year-old hospital employee.
""We were 100 percent sure that they would not hit here,"" she told AFP, describing the frantic rush as staff moved children with IV drips to the bunker.
Officials said the attack had also damaged several residential buildings and an office block in Kyiv where AFP reporters saw cars on fire and shredded trees in charred courtyards.
DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy company, said three of its electrical substations had been destroyed or damaged in Kyiv. Russian strikes on electricity infrastructure have already halved Ukrainian generation capacity in recent weeks compared to one year ago.
Russian forces have repeatedly targeted the capital with massive barrages since invading Ukraine in February 2022, and the last major attack on Kyiv with drones and missiles was last month.
- Must respond 'with force' -
The emergency services said 22 people were killed in Kyiv on Monday, including at both medical facilities hit in the attack, and that another 72 had been wounded.
In Zelensky's hometown of Kryvyi Rig, which has been repeatedly targeted by Russian bombardment, the strikes killed at least 10 and wounded more than 41, officials there said.
In Dnipro, a city of around one million people in the same region, one person was killed and six more were wounded, the region's governor said, when a high-rise residential building and petrol station were hit.
And in the eastern Donetsk region, where Russian forces have taken a string of villages in recent weeks, the regional governor said three people were killed in Pokrovsk -- a town that had a pre-war population of around 60,000 people.
""This shelling targeted civilians, hit infrastructure, and the whole world should see today the consequences of terror, which can only be responded to by force,"" the head of Ukraine's presidential administration, Andriy Yermak, wrote on social media.
Zelensky and other officials in Kyiv have been urging Ukraine's allies to send more air defence systems, including Patriots, to help fend off deadly Russian aerial bombardment.
""Russia cannot claim ignorance of where its missiles are flying and must be held fully accountable for all its crimes,"" Zelensky said in another post on social media.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/biden-falters-in-fiery-debate-with-trump-n344830,"Biden falters in fiery debate with Trump
Published on: June 28, 2024 08:26 (EAT)
US President Joe Biden looks down as he participates in the first presidential debate of the 2024 elections with former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at CNN's studios in Atlanta, Georgia, on June 27, 2024. (Photo by ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS / AFP)
A halting Joe Biden struggled Thursday to allay concerns he is too old for a second term in the White House in a fiery debate with Donald Trump marked by personal insults.
A bombastic Trump lashed out at his successor, calling him a failure on the economy and the world stage.
Biden looked to hit back, but his delivery was faltering as he spoke rapidly in a raspy, trailing-off voice, stumbled on his words and stared open-mouthed.
His performance, after he spent the week secluded in preparation, sparked new concern within his Democratic Party as polls show Trump is tied or ahead for the November election.
It was the first debate ever between a president and former president -- and each accused each other of being history's worst.
Trump and Biden, who were each the oldest president when first elected, even accused each other of being childlike as they argued over their golf swings.
Biden, 81, and Trump, 78, did not shake hands as they walked to their podiums at the CNN headquarters in Atlanta. There was no live audience and their microphones were muted as the other spoke.
Biden hit Trump with clearly rehearsed lines as he sought to remind millions of television viewers that Trump would be the first convicted felon in the White House.
""You have the morals of an alley cat,"" Biden said.
Trump, a veteran of rallies and reality television, spoke loudly as he ran through a long list of complaints about Biden's record.
""I'm friends with a lot of people. They cannot believe what happened to the United States of America. We're no longer respected,"" Trump said.
Trump sought to seize on Biden's delivery, saying at one point, ""I really don't know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don't think he knows what he said either.""
Stopping by a Waffle House restaurant to pick up food after the debate, Biden told reporters he had soar throat but ""I think we did well.""
The White House was clearly in damage-control mode.
Vice President Kamala Harris, in a live interview on CNN, said Biden's record was ""extraordinarily strong"" but acknowledged concerns about his debate performance.
""Yes, there was a slow start, but it was a strong finish,"" Harris said.
Kate Bedingfield, a former Biden communications director, said on CNN that ""it was a really disappointing"" evening for the president.
""I don't think there is any other way to slice it,"" she said.
A CNN poll found 67 percent of debate watchers thought Trump had won.
Democrats are set formally to name Biden as their candidate in August in Chicago, with little way to change course unless the president himself withdraws.
But Julian Zelizer, a historian at Princeton University, said Biden's supporters would be ""extremely concerned.""
""Biden fueled the basic perception that has continued to overshadow him,"" he said.
At a watch party in San Francisco, Hazel Reitz said she would still vote for Biden but added: ""I can't understand a word that he says. Isn't it sad?""
Neither candidate laid out new policies, with most of the exchanges consisting of attacks on the other's record.
In one of the most personal moments, Biden cited accounts that Trump had described soldiers who died in the Normandy landing as ""suckers"" and noted his own son Beau, who served in Iraq and later died of cancer.
""My son was not a loser, was not a sucker. You're the sucker. You're the loser,"" Biden said.
Trump denied the remarks and repeatedly accused Biden of not being coherent.
On foreign policy, Trump accused Biden -- who faces a backlash from parts of his Democratic base over his support for Israel -- of not helping Israel ""finish the job"" against Hamas.
""He doesn't want to do it. He's become like a Palestinian -- but they don't like him because he's a very bad Palestinian, he's a weak one,"" Trump said.
Trump described Biden's withdrawal from Afghanistan as the ""most embarrassing moment in the history of our country"" and said it encouraged Russia to invade Ukraine.
Biden, however, noted that he was the first recent president who has not had soldiers at risk overseas.
Trump and Biden also locked horns over abortion and immigration, key issues for their respective bases.
Biden, attacking Trump for appointing justices to the Supreme Court who ended Roe vs. Wade, the decision that allowed abortion rights around the country, said: ""It's been a terrible thing, what you've done.""
One candidate not on the stage was anti-establishment activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who failed to meet CNN's threshold of reaching 15 percent in four national polls.
Kennedy instead spent the 90 minutes taking questions on a livestream.

The shock of the tournament came when defending champions Koyonzo High School suffered a 10-14 defeat at the hands of St. Peters' Mumias in the semi-finals.
Koyonzo who were favourites having enjoyed a good run in the last two years boast of winning the East Africa 7s title without losing to any school in Kenya. Kakamega whipped Musingu 27-10 in the other semis to set a date with the saints.
Heading into the finals, the Amos Wamanga-led charges registered a 53-7 win against Mwihila boys in the group preliminary stage. Kakamega went on to extend their winning streak by defeating Milimani's secondary 52-0 before winding the day with another huge win by beating Kilimani 58-00 to book their quarter-final slot where they humbled Ingotse 19-05.
Koyonzo settled for third place after beating Musingu 12-05 in the third and fourth playoffs.
All four teams will qualify for the Western Region Secondary Schools Sports Association (WRSSSA) and will fly the Kakamega County flag in the competition to take place at Bungoma High School on a yet to be confirmed date.
Kakamega who are the five-time National 7s champions and eight-time National 15s champions will be keen to gain their lost glory after being in the cold from the national competition since 2019.

High Court Judge Lawrence Mugambi greenlighted the deployment and ordered that the terms of the deployment be gazetted within two days.
In the meantime, the military will continue to be deployed to protect critical government infrastructure.
""Continuation of military assistance is necessary in view of the need to preserve order and protect military infrastructure,"" Judge Mugambi said.
While delivering the verdict during a virtual hearing fraught with technical difficulties, Judge Mugambi argued that the deployment of the military in a blanket manner, without specific details about the period of deployment, was likely to result in the militarization of the country.
""The public was not fully appraised of the extent of the military intervention hence suspicion,"" Judge Mugambi said.
He stated that given that the military is not trained for civilian engagements, the blanked deployment would likely silence civilian populations exercising their democratic rights and drive a wedge between them and the servicemen.
According to the Thursday ruling, the court will retain residuary powers to hear any complaints or violations of rights during the period of deployment.
LSK had argued in the petition that a state of emergency should have been declared so that the KDF could be deployed to protect critical government infrastructure and restore order.
They also argued that parliamentary approval was sought only after the deployment was gazetted, which violated Kenyan law.
LSK, while challenging the deployment, told the court in its petition that there was no emergency or critical security incident that required military deployment.
According to LSK president Faith Odhiambo, the deployment should have been gazetted 24 hours after parliament's approval.
Ms. Odhiambo said Defence Cabinet Secretary Aden Duale sought approval after the gazettement, which was unprocedural.
The government, through the Attorney General, Justin Muturi, argued that the gazettement had followed due process.
Judge Mugambi stated that the invasion of parliament and the Chief Justice's office by allegedly peaceful protesters met the definition of a ""serious, unprecedented, and potentially dangerous situation requiring immediate action.""
Additionally, the loss of police control necessitated military intervention.

Health care providers have urged Kenyans to be cautious following the onset of the cold weather season.
Speaking to Citizen Digital, the medics noted that the cold spell could bring with it bouts of flu.
The cold season in Kenya typically sets in around June, extending through to August.
""We urge the public to take precautions to safeguard their health since we are already in the cold season,""Emmanuel Kulundu, a medic, said.
With dropping temperatures coupled with instances of rain across various parts of the country, he called for the need to take preventive measures.

A spot check by Citizen Digital confirmed heavy police presence in the Nairobi Central Business District (CBD), the expected epicentre of the youth-led protests.
The security officers have been deployed on various streets in the city centre with access to areas leading to Parliament being sealed off to the public.
The youth-led demonstrations commenced last week in objection to the unsavoury Bill which proposes heavy taxes for Kenyans.
The protesters have vowed to bring business to a total shutdown today in protest of the Finance Bill.
The government tried to cede ground but the protesters said they want the entire Bill dropped and not merely edited. Two people have been reported killed.
On Monday, Interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki cleared the air amid heightening tensions that the planned nationwide protest can go ahead as long as it will be peaceful.
He said that those who wish to demonstrate can go ahead with their plans as long as they adhere to the rule of law.
""The government of Kenya will respect, uphold, promote and fulfill the inalienable constitutional right of every person peaceably and unarmed to assemble, to demonstrate, to picket and to present petitions to authorities,"" said Prof Kindiki in his State of Homeland Security speech.
Kindiki dared protesters to breach peace saying protesters ""must not interfere with road, rail, sea or air transport in any manner whatsoever.""
The latter however comes those believed to be most vocal about the protests are being abducted, causing public uproar as many Kenyans demand for their immediate release.
Two youths died in last week's protests and many were left injured.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/hustler-fund-cs-chelugui-clarifies-red-flags-raised-by-auditor-general-says-data-is-available-and-verifiable-n345527,"Hustler Fund: CS Chelugui clarifies red flags raised by Auditor General, says data is available and verifiable
Cooperatives and MSMEs Cabinet Secretary Simon Chelugui
has defended President William Ruto’s pilot project, the Hustler Fund, over
concerns about irregularities in the establishment of the fund.
In a
statement on Tuesday, Chelugui clarified issues of inconsistencies,
transparency and lack of unaccountability from the government on the rollout and
management of the credit fund which Auditor General Dr Nancy Gathungu raised.
Chelugui highlighted the issues raised by Dr Gathungu
attributing the failure by the Fund to provide financial statements for audit
review to a timeliness hold-up, saying that the required data was presented and
would be submitted for audit.
“During the
audit, the office flagged a number of issues that required clarity and
additional information that bordered mostly on data reconciliation. Given the nature of the product, the
data and the information needed, the process took a bit longer and by the time we were time bad as the audit report had to be tabled to
Parliament as per Constitutional timelines,” he explained.
“Whereas
they received our management responses, due to the timelines, they could not
therefore reverify the system to establish the milestone that had been covered
in data reconciliation and subsequent updates to address their audit quarries.”
The
ministry in its defence acknowledged several challenges during the
fund's inception, including understaffing, errors in note numbering, data
extraction issues, missing data dumps, and overall extraction challenges, as the
cause of some of the cases of data
manipulation and Integrity.
“On
Concerns about data manipulation and Integrity, the audit process was not in a
live environment and therefore during the data extraction there are possibility
of having data errors due to the huge sizes. Some of this could be due to data
truncation and reconciliation errors,” he noted.
In regard to issues
raised on client identification, registration, onboarding and subsequent
borrowing, CS Chelugui noted that telecoms and banks had the requisite and verifiable
data since the Fund uses an ID and a sim card as a mandatory requirement for registration.
“Out of over
20 million borrowers in the review period, only 5 borrowers did not have their IDs
captured. This was brought about by a technical transition surge issue on
December 1, 2022,” he stated.
“The issue
on Duplication of loan IDs was a case of customers topping up their existing
loans but within their assigned credit limit. For loan top-ups as opposed to
new loan requests, the system maintains the same loan contract (loan ID) as
only performs principal increase to the existing loan.”
The Auditor
in his discrepancy report on Monday had reported cases of 129,315 closed accounts holding Ksh. 81,622,289, and 867 instances
of duplicate loan identity numbers, which processed 1,978 loans amounting to Ksh.477,928.
CS Chelugui further addressed concerns that the fund exceeded
its set-loan limits including 238,707 cases where loans totaling Ksh.420,312,323
were issued, surpassing the initial limit by Ksh.219,615,242.
He said that the Fund’s model ensured a limit review two
times a year, which later introduced a savings-led limit increase
“On limit
enhancement, the Hustler Fund personal product design provides room for the
limit review. So far, we have had two limit reviews, the first one in
February 2023 and the second one in December 2023 which introduced a
savings-led limit increase. There were borrowers who saved voluntarily which
boosted their loan limit increment,” Chelugui said.
The CS at the same time expressed commitment to work with
the Auditor General and open its doors for an audit to ensure the Ministry
remains compliant to the regulatory standards in line with the law.
“We are in
the process of conducting an audit for this financial year by the Office of the
Auditor General (OAG) that will help to verify all transactions and ensure
compliance with regulatory standards. The Hustler fund is a digital platform,
and all records can be traced, ranging from the date of application, the
transaction IDs which can be provided if an entity meets Data Protection
criteria,” added Chelugui.
“The
Ministry of Cooperatives & MSMEs is committed to conducting a live
environment audit by the OAG to verify all operational processes and address any
outstanding issues promptly. We remain dedicated to ensuring that the Hustler Fund
operates with the highest standards of integrity, accountability, and
efficiency.”
According to
the CS as of now, the Fund has attracted a customer base of 23.6 million Kenyans
with disbursements amounting to Ksh.54.5 billion and accrued savings of Ksh.3.1
billion.
The group
product, on the other hand, has served a total of 23,534 groups disbursing Ksh.182.7
million so far.

They also want the president to sack the inspector general of police as part of the reforms to get the government back on the right track.
The leaders, who spoke during an interdenominational service in remembrance of the youth killed in the protests, also vowed to clean the pulpit of politicians.
""It didn’t matter what denomination they belonged to,"" they all gathered at the All Saints Cathedral, united in prayers for the families of the youth who lost their lives in protests over the last three weeks.
Families of those who died recounted how their lives have been changed.
""It is hard, very hard,"" one family member said.
The prayers were called by the National Council of Churches of Kenya and the Evangelical Alliance of Kenya, where all member churches held prayers and memorial services to honor the lives lost in the recent anti-tax protests.
Religious leaders took a stand against the police brutality that left tens dead and hundreds injured.
At the All Saints Cathedral, leaders emphasized that the president still has a lot more to do to steady the ship, calling for him to dissolve the cabinet and start over.
The religious leaders hailed the youth for not just taking a stand but following through by taking action that saw the oppressive laws abandoned.
They also acknowledged their own failures and pledged to change, as the youth called for more accountability from the political class.
""We must keep politics out of the pulpit and not take donations from politicians,"" one leader stated.
While the service at the All Saints Cathedral was more laid back, at the Holy Family Basilica, the youth answered the call to come dressed in the colors of the protests.
They were agitated in their mourning and demands for justice and better governance. ""There will be no more sirens on the roads,"" declared one youth.
The Catholic Church leadership also encouraged the youth to take up their rightful role but to be wary of those who would use their movement and momentum to derail their change agenda.
Bishop Anyolo emphasized the importance of vigilance in maintaining the integrity of their cause.
The dead were honored and remembered as heroes in the fight for better governance from those in positions of leadership in the country.

The Kenya National Commission on Human
Rights (KNCHR) has dismissed President William Ruto's claims on Sunday night
that the state-funded rights watchdog gave misleading information to the public
about a reported ‘massacre’ in Nairobi’s Githurai area.
Following day-long anti-Finance Bill
protests on Tuesday, June 25, unconfirmed reports emerged that the police and military
forces were slaughtering people in the residential area late in the night.
In a media roundtable at State House
Nairobi on Sunday, Ruto was asked about the number of people the police killed
since the protests began, which he maintained are 19 but which rights groups –
including KNCHR – have placed much higher.
He accused the commission of falsely reporting that 20 people were killed in the Githurai ‘massacre’.
KNCHR chairperson Roseline Odede in a
statement later in the evening however dismissed Ruto’s claims, maintaining
that the commission did not give such a statement.
“We the Kenya National Commission on Human
Rights have not issued any statement on Githurai. We are still in the process
of confirming the happenings in Githurai, Rongai, Migori, Nakuru, and other
parts of the country,” Odede said.
“From data in our possession, we had reports
of 22 deaths arising from the protests, as of Wednesday when we made our last
statement, and that is what we reported.
Odede added that the commission has
confirmed 24 deaths since the protests began on June 18.
In its press statement on June 26 following
reports of the killings in Githurai, KNCHR did not give any figures on the
alleged incident, per President Ruto’s claims.
“The Commission witnessed with shock as police officers moved into residential areas of Githurai and Jinja in the evening of Tuesday 25th June 2024 and were allegedly involved in indiscriminate shooting of civilians. As a result of this, the Commission has received unverified reports of scores of residents who were killed by the stray bullets. We will be investigating this to ensure accountability for these atrocities,” the rights body said at the time.

Residents of Ganze Constituency in Kilifi County have called on the government to put up an electric fence around the Tsavo East National Park, amid a spike in cases of elephant invasion.
The marauding elephants have caused panic in the area, following the death of a local.
“The recent incident has sparked fear among residents. The elephants also destroy crops in our farms,” a resident said.
The incident was reported in Myra-Chakwe village. The body of the deceased was taken to Kilifi Teaching and Referral Hospital Morgue.
Residents hoped the recent rains would drive the elephants back to the forest but this has not been the case.
According to Eunice Shungu, a farmer in the area, she has incurred losses of up to Ksh.300,000.
“I started a cassava farming project with my husband and have a client who had already paid us Ksh. 50,000 up front. The cassava was to be harvested at the end of the month but the elephants floored the plantation,” Shungu said.
Kafedha Kazungu Maitha, a resident of Jitume village added that her farm has been turned into a grazing field.
“I planted cassava in my farm three times but it was all destroyed. I reported the matter to KWS and was told to go to the office at Arabuko Sokoke, but I cannot afford the fare to get there,” Maitha added.
Following the recent developments, schools in Ganze have changed the reporting times with parents calling on the government to move with speed and avert further crisis.

President William Ruto
has submitted a Memorandum of Referral to National Assembly Speaker Moses
Wetangula, officially initiating the process to have the controversial Finance
Bill 2024/25 withdrawn.
Ruto verbally withdrew the
contentious bill on Wednesday, sparking debates on whether he had the
constitutional powers to do so, given that Parliament went on recess earlier in
the day and would resume regular sittings on Tuesday, July 23.
According
to clause 6 of the Constitution, if the president refuses to sign a bill and
fails to return it to Parliament within 14 days, the bill will be considered law, and as such, Ruto had to officially initiate the process by writing to Speaker Wetangula.
""The Finance Bill,
2024, was presented to me for Presidential Assent in accordance with the
provisions of the Constitution on June 26, 2024. Taking into consideration the
widespread expression of dissatisfaction by members of the public on the
contents of the Finance Bill, 2024,"" said Ruto in the referral.
""Now therefore, in
exercise of the powers conferred to me by Article (115) (1)(b) of the
constitution and having reservations on the contents of the Bill in its
entirety, I decline to assent to the Finance Bill, 2024 and refer the bill for
consideration by the National Assembly with the recommendation for the deletion
of all the clauses thereof.""
Ruto's
recommendation must be passed by a two-thirds majority in Parliament for the bill to be withdrawn in its entirety.

Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale has criticised
Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa and other politicians for their public display of wealth
as Kenyans struggle with the biting cost of living.
During Wednesday’s plenary sitting at the
Senate, Khalwale said politicians’ public display of opulence is among the
issues angering Kenyans amid the ongoing anti-government protests.
“Hon. Didmus Barasa, take it easy;
helicopters will not change your life,” Khalwale told the MP, who was recently
reported to have acquired a multi-million-shilling chopper that he uses to
attend public functions.
Khalwale told President William Ruto to
investigate the flashy lifestyles of his government's officials, even as he
pledges austerity for his government in the wake of the Finance Bill, 2024’s
scrapping.
“The President should ask himself how the
membership of an MP to a committee in Parliament be the basis for him to be
able to afford some of the things that are not affordable,” said the senator.
President Ruto on Sunday promised to address the opulence and extravagance displayed by some state officers,
particularly Cabinet Secretaries and MPs.
""I promise you, watch this space. Going forward you will see changes because we must do something about opulence and extravagance. We are going to take measures that will put us in the right place,"" Ruto said in an interview with the media at State House Nairobi.

The credit ratings agency downgraded the country's local- and foreign-currency long-term issuer ratings and foreign-currency senior unsecured debt ratings to ""Caa1"" from ""B3"".
In June, Kenyan President Willian Ruto withdrew planned tax hikes in response to mass protests that turned deadly, killing at least 24 people.
The scrapped finance bill contained measures intended to aid the government's aim to raise $2.7 billion in additional taxes to reduce budget deficit and state borrowing.
In order to compensate for the withdrawn finance bill, Ruto's administration has proposed cuts in spending.
Moody's said that while the spending cuts should narrow fiscal deficit, it would be at a more gradual pace than previously assumed, and as a result, expect Kenya's debt affordability to remain weaker for longer.
""In the context of heightened social tensions, we do not expect the government to be able to introduce significant revenue-raising measures in the foreseeable future,"" the ratings agency said.
Moody's affirmed its 'negative' outlook for Kenya, stating that the larger fiscal deficits will push up borrowing requirements and subsequently increase government liquidity risks.

A Mikel Merino goal in the penultimate minute of extra time grabbed Spain a dramatic 2-1 win over Germany to send them into the Euro 2024 semi-finals and keep their dreams of a record-breaking fourth European Championship title alive.
After a fiery yet goalless first half, Spain's Dani Olmo latched onto an inch-perfect pass from 16-year-old Lamine Yamal to give La Roja the lead on 51 minutes.
Niclas Fuellkrug struck the post with 14 minutes remaining but with the hosts staring at an exit, Florian Wirtz slammed in a Joshua Kimmich knock-down in the 89th minute to take the game to extra time.
With the game looking set for penalties, Olmo lofted a cross for Merino, who headed Spain to victory and a semi-final meeting with either France or Portugal.
""Well, I'm dead, really. The adrenaline is taking its toll on me now. It has been a special moment,"" goalscorer Merino said after.
Olmo said he was ""exhausted really"", adding: ""It is a source of pride, what a great team we have, how we have fought until the end.""
Germany's elimination ends the hosts' hopes of a fairytale Euros victory after a decade of poor performances at major tournaments, while also lowering the curtain on Toni Kroos' stellar career.
""We played a good tournament but when you're so close, to be eliminated like that, it's bitter,"" Kroos told ARD.
The battle between the two most successful Euros nations, with three titles apiece, was billed as a final come early, with the in-form Spaniards against Julian Nagelsmann's reborn hosts.
Spain nominated Kroos as Germany's most dangerous player pre-match but the midfielder had a huge, even if unintended impact early, colliding with Pedri, who was then substituted with a leg injury for Olmo.
Germany, with the oldest squad at Euro 2024, struggled with Spain's speed during the first half, frequently coming into tackles a fraction too late, but the two best chances of the opening half fell to the hosts - and both to Kai Havertz.
The Arsenal forward leapt highest to head a cross directly at Unai Simon early and then scuffed a tame shot at the goalie later in the half with just the 'keeper to beat.
Nagelsmann took off surprise starter Emre Can for the pink-haired Robert Andrich, while the ineffective Leroy Sane was replaced by Wirtz.
The substitution who would make his mark however was Olmo, who gave Spain the lead six minutes into the second half, slicing through the sleepy Germany defence to perfectly place a Yamal pass past Manuel Neuer into the bottom left corner.
The goal kicked Germany into gear with Wirtz particularly dangerous.
The Bayer Leverkusen starlet linked with Fuellkrug on the counter with a quarter of an hour remaining but the striker, under heavy attention from the Spanish defence, could only hit the post.
With 10 minutes remaining Nagelsmann made his final substitution, bringing veteran Thomas Mueller from the bench.
But it was Wirtz - 13 years his junior - who made the difference, skimming a Kimmich header across the grass and in at the far post.
Mikel Oyarzabal, on for Nico Williams, curled a 104th-minute shot just wide of the post and Wirtz did the same a minute later with the goal beckoning.
Germany appealed strongly for a penalty in the second period of extra time, after a Jamal Musiala shot hit Marc Cucurella's hand, but after a VAR check the original decision to not award a spot-kick stood.
Minutes later, Olmo curled in a cross for Merino, who leapt high to head the ball past Neuer and put Spain into the semi-finals.
Luis de la Fuente will be forced into changes for Tuesday's semi, after Dani Carvajal received his marching orders for hauling down Musiala for a second yellow card of the match.
Centre-back Robin Le Normand and captain Alvaro Morata will also be suspended for picking up yellows, with the Spain skipper earning a late caution for his celebrations in the aftermath of Merino's winner.

According to Sossion, the government would have no ill intent to burn a critical structure of the republic such as Parliament and they cannot sponsor goons to disfigure it.
In his view, he said that ""other interests"" took advantage of the demonstrations and assigned the goons to cause the damage witnessed.
""That is a wrong allegation and there is already detailed report that indeed other interests sponsored these syndicate groups and the government would have no interests whatsoever in sponsoring goons to burn parliament,"" he said speaking to Citizen TV on Monday.
He further argued that police officers exercised restraint and did not fire at the charging young protesters, despite a few shot dead outside parliament buildings.
Sossion added that the police should not be blamed for the breaching of parliament since they had been long overpowered by the crowd.
""We cannot say it is the police that allowed it. When you have such a huge group pulling down a fence and surging into Parliament you could not expect the police to shoot at the citizens in fact the police exercise a lot of restraint and retreated,"" said Sossion.
The hiring of goons has been a raging debate during the protests that have occurred over the last three weeks as peaceful protesters have distanced themselves from the destruction of property and looting of businesses.
Politicians have been accused of hiring the goons even as a group of disgruntled youth came out to demand payment after claiming to have been hired by politicians to participate in the protests on July 2.
Youths flocked Uhuru Park grounds on Sunday, the site of the Shujaaz Memorial concert, dressed in black and waving Kenyan flags to honour those killed during anti-government protests.
Protesters erected white makeshift crosses bearing the names of Kenyans who died during anti-tax protests. The crosses were adorned with the Kenyan flag.
While the state claims that 25 people have been killed and 400 have been injured, rights groups believe the numbers are higher.
According to the Kenya Human Rights Commission (KHRC), at least 43 people were killed during the demonstrations, and over 600 were injured in varying degrees.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/trump-allies-intensify-harris-attacks-as-biden-replacement-talk-builds-n345232,"Trump allies intensify Harris attacks as Biden replacement talk builds
On social media and in a flurry of statements over the past 48 hours, Trump's campaign and his Republican allies appear to be laying the groundwork for an all-out assault on Harris should the 81-year-old Biden decide to end his re-election bid following his feeble debate performance last week.
While Biden has insisted he is not quitting the race four months before the Nov. 5 election, and Harris has stood firmly behind him, the Trump campaign has little to lose by attacking the vice president now, so that if Harris does emerge as the nominee, she might do so in a weakened state.
Republicans have regularly criticized Harris, 59, during Biden's term in office, but the attacks this week represented a sharp and seemingly coordinated escalation that appeared to be linked to increased talk about her possibly replacing Biden as the Democratic presidential candidate.
The National Republican Congressional Committee, which oversees House Republican races, called her Biden's ""enabler in chief.""
MAGA Inc, a fundraising super PAC supporting Trump, released a statement calling her the ""invasion czar."" In March 2021 Biden said Harris would lead efforts with Mexico and Central American nations to address illegal immigration.
Republicans have seized on that to accuse her of failing to stem the flow of millions of migrants crossing illegally into the United States, although she was never directly responsible for securing the southern border.
""Kamala Harris is incompetent. She's proven to be the weakest, worst vice president in history, and she has 100% supported Joe Biden in every single disastrous policy that he has implemented over the last four years,"" said Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the Trump campaign.
Trump disparaged Harris in a video recorded at one of his golf courses, published by The Daily Beast on Wednesday, saying Harris was ""so bad, she's so pathetic"" before using an expletive to describe her.
Trump's campaign stood by his words, with co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita saying on X: ""Nothing in this video is incorrect.""
Biden campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said, ""No, Donald. What is bad is taking away women’s rights; What is bad is losing an election and encouraging a violent mob to attack the Capitol.""
PROUD RUNNING MATE
The Biden campaign pushed back against the escalating Republican criticism of Harris without addressing the question of whether the vice president is waiting in the wings.
""Vice President Harris is proud to be President Biden's running mate,"" said Rhyan Lake, a campaign spokesperson for Harris.
""No matter what false attacks Trump and his extreme allies make, she will continue to defend the Biden-Harris record and prosecute the case against Donald Trump.""
The swipes at Harris by Trump's camp were reminiscent of a similar tactic that the Republican Trump, president from 2017-2021, used to successfully undermine Ron DeSantis, his main Republican rival, before the Florida governor jumped into their party's 2024 election primary race last year.
Corey Lewandowski, a longtime Trump adviser, told Reuters Harris was politically vulnerable given her role in addressing illegal immigration, among other issues that are part of extensive research the party has gathered on her record.
TRUMP'S UNUSUAL SILENCE
A former senior staffer in the Trump White House who is still in contact with the Trump campaign said the newfound emphasis on Harris made sense.
""If Joe Biden stays on top of the ticket, given what we've seen, she takes on even more importance. But if he does step aside, she's the potential candidate. This is about defining her,"" the staffer said, pointing to her low approval ratings in public opinion polls.
Despite her consistently low approval ratings, a Reuters/Ipsos poll earlier this week showed Harris to be as formidable an opponent to Trump as Biden.
In a hypothetical matchup, Trump led Harris by a single percentage point, 43% to 42%.
The clamor by Trump's allies is in stark contrast with the unusual silence from the normally voluble former president. Since Biden's poor debate performance, Trump has laid low, making few public appearances or public statements.
""This shows a maturation of the candidate himself. You can teach an old dog new tricks. He's showing increased discipline and message control,"" said a senior adviser to the Trump campaign familiar with internal discussions.
Even before the June 27 debate, the Trump campaign was beginning to turn its attention to Harris, releasing an attack ad online that mocked her for repeating lines in her speeches.
An online meme promoted by Republicans showed Harris repeating the same phrase ""unburdened by what has been"" again and again in remarks.
Harris' defenders say she has become more of a target because of her leading role in attacking Trump over abortion rights and her vigorous defense of Biden on the campaign trail.
If Biden were to exit the race before the Democratic National Convention in August, there is no guarantee Harris would be the nominee.
But as vice president, she likely would be first in line. She would benefit from Biden's immense campaign war chest and likely see a large segment of Democrats rally around her in a bid to avoid a bitter intra-party battle.
And as the first Black vice president in U.S. history, she provides a bridge to the party's most dependable voting bloc. Her background and relative youth would make for a sharp contrast with Trump, 78.

Published on: June 29, 2024 01:38 (EAT)
By Aaron Kipkoech
A small town surrounded by mountains that create a beautiful and peaceful landscape, Mulot the once sleepy area in Bomet county, has become known for something other than its beauty - notorious fraudsters known for sim swapping scams.
A SIM swap scam is a type of account takeover fraud that generally targets a weakness in two-factor authentication and two-step verification in which the second factor or step is a text message or call placed to a mobile telephone, according to Wikipedia.
The majority of those engaging in the activity are unemployed youths between the ages of 14 and 35.
Our reporter visited the area and spoke to residents about the fraud which has affected many, and filed this report:
Alfred Koech, a small-scale trader, told Wananchi Reporting, “Many youths have abandoned their studies. They don’t study, they don't work and many are using unemployment as an excuse to engage in crime.”
Noah Kiplangat, a local, said he has struggled to find work after dropping out of school when he was in Form 2 for lack of school fees.
He said, “I have been unsuccessful in finding a job. Many people are in a similar situation and that’s how they find themselves engaging in fraud such as sim swapping.”
According to Bomet Central deputy police commander, Nelson Imamai, the sim swap fraud is a cause for concern and many youths have been arrested and held in remand due to the activity.
He said officers were hunting down culprits and they will face the full force of the law.
Imamai said youths have been advised to use their knowledge to engage in gainful activities such as setting up a technology hub, however, they have not heeded the advice.
Nelson Maritim, a resident, urged youths to engage in productive activities, even if they are unemployed and even consider starting small businesses selling fruit and vegetables instead of engaging in crime.
He said, “Many of these youths are idle and are looking for money to meet their basic needs, and that pushes them to engage in the wrong activities.”
Maritim continued, “The government should set up an IT hub for them so that they can use the knowledge they have for good and create employment through it.”
Julius Sigei, another resident, condemned the fraudsters, saying they engaged in crime and framed innocent individuals, who ended up being charged after unknowingly giving out their details.

https://www.citizen.digital/opinion-blogs/opinion-bwire-attacks-on-journalists-unacceptable-and-criminal-n344821,"OPINION: BWIRE - Attacks on journalists unacceptable and criminal
""I was born a Kenyan before becoming a journalist! Why do the police think I should not get involved in things affecting Kenyans, and above all do my legitimate work as a journalist?""
An irritated journalism student covering the FinanceBill2024 protest called me desperately. He had been arrested while covering the protests in Nairobi, his press card destroyed and made to spend at the Central Police Station for one night. He was truly traumatised and frustrated by the experience.
“I think Media Council of Kenya needs to have a massive sensitization and training of police officers on the rights and privileges of journalists covering national public interest issues. So police in their right thinking want journalists not to cover national protests of this national importance”
""Why would the police think journalists are a threat to the country while knowing the cause of the protests were not journalists”, a journalist, who had been hit and injured by a tear gas canister wrote to me.
“Why is that when we have national security threats like terrorism
attacks and threats, the security agencies seek or cooperation and
understanding, but when we have protests against the government, they target
journalists- what changes”, a journalist from Taita Taveta noted this while
narrating his ordeal at the hands of the police even after showing his MCK
press card.
Scenes of beaten and bleeding journalists and photographers, colleagues, journalists jumping out of police moving vehicles, damaged media equipment, traumatised and harassed journalists are among the worst human rights violations documented during the protests, that were broadcast live across communication challenges inside and outside Kenya, but the police firmly believed the enemy was the media.
That a trained security officer, who earlier in the day had been briefed and taken through the forces standing orders could turn into injuring a fellow Kenyan assigned to cover the protests, who could easily be their young brother or sister doing their job for whatever reason is unimaginable, inhuman and the most insensitive act from a professional police officer.
Dealing with such protests and issues requires intelligence-based and democratic policing, where officers use modern ways of crowd dispersal, management and containment, away from the wait and shoot / injure approach that we are using.
Professionalism and Decency must prevail in such cases especially when it comes to dealing with journalists, who in most cases have national IDs, media house staff identification and branded equipment and MCK press card.
Journalists and media practitioners remain subjects of harassment threats, intimidation, and attacks because of their legitimate work of gathering and analysis of information citizens of national issues of concern, without which even if they did not happen, would still happen.
Even if the media gave the protests a blackout, would the protests not have happened? This miscaption that stopping the media from covering public interest issues will stop citizens demanding accountability is misleading.
In fact, in some countries, media reports and analyses as part of the intelligence of the country that inform effective responses to such national crises.
The irony and pretense of these attacks against the media is always immediately seen when after beating journalists in the streets, the same journalists were invited for pressers in the offices.
What changes- the work of the journalists doesn’t include pleasing people, working on red carpets and posh beach hotels- but on the streets, deserts, flooded areas, crimes scenes and development project areas- to report from the front lines not necessarily on edited speeches and curated news. Journalists are first line responders and are covered internally with legitimate privileges that come with their work.
The harassment of journalists violates several Constitutional provisions in Kenya including, Article 25 (freedom from torture and degrading treatment), Articles 28 (freedom to be treated with dignity), Articles 29 (freedom to security), Articles 33 (freedom of expression), Articles 34 (media freedoms), Articles 35 (Access to information and Article 41 (labor rights). Kenya is a signatory to both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) whose Article 19 provides for the right for media freedom.
UNESCO Member States passed Resolution 29 on “Condemnation of violence against journalists”. UN Security Council Resolution 1738 (2006) condemns attacks against journalists in conflict situations.
Among the tips given for journalists covering riots, protests and demonstrations include; maintain control of your life and movements, making clear decision to stay or withdraw from the scene, select pre-arranged positions to cover from ahead of the protestors, once gas/bullets start being fired, exit, never confront demonstrators or looters / security personnel, establish prior knowledge of risks involved in covering the protests and region and having protective gear.
In addition, journalists are advised to work in groups with colleagues, carry identification visible- (MCK and Employer card / water, handkerchief, remain neutral and impartial in the coverage, always remaining in outer edge of the protest among others.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/protests-turn-violent-as-gen-z-distances-itself-from-hooliganism-n345084,"Protests turn violent as Gen Z distances itself from hooliganism
The Gen Z movement is distancing itself from acts of violence witnessed in parts of the country on the fifth day of protests as acts committed by hooligans and goons. the protests that had been called to push for reforms in governance turned violent.
The protests, which initially started off as a push to have the government do away with the Finance bill 2024, had seen thousands of youthful Kenyans take to the streets to protest.
The face of the protests has been changing with claims of infiltration by hired goons to disrupt, loot and plunder.
Unlike the first and second Tuesday demos, there was a marked difference in the look and feel of the protesters and the deployment and equipping of security agents. The impact was soon seen on the streets both in and out of Nairobi.
""I had come to demonstrate like my fellow youth, but goons have been sent and they are destroying businesses and stealing phones,"" Millicent, a protester, told Citizen TV.
Some of the online personalities who have been associated with the occupy protests are distancing the Gen Z's from the actions that have accompanied the demonstrations across parts of the country.
Activist Boniface mwangi on an X post, for instance, accused the government of letting goons take over the protests and loot and destroy property.
The protests, when they started mid last month, were spearheaded by the youthful Gen Z generation.
The protests planned and organised online saw the youth turn up in the multitudes, dressed in a somewhat uniform manner, with their intentions and goals clearly spelt out, quite literally and verbally...
They were also guided by a code that prohibited the use of violence, destruction of property and even guidelines on where to go for legal and medical help during the protests.
However the organised protests has slowly been changing with each passing protest day. Now the placards-carrying, youth are slowly getting replaced by other groups whose actions seem to be at odds with the occupy State House movement...
In the Nairobi CBD, business owners say they were forced to guard their businesses against those who have infiltrated the protests with the intent of looting and destroying property.
The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNHCR) flagged this changing face and character of the protest as early as Wednesday last week.
""We have noted the change in the demographic of the protesters, where as last week they were young and peaceful, it seems that other people from other sectors of life infiltrated the protest and turned them violent,"" KNHCR Chair Roseline Odede said.
It is unclear whether the government will respond as more protests had been planned for this Thursday.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/president-ruto-says-foreigners-behind-anti-govt-protests-n345627,"President Ruto says foreigners behind anti-Gov't protests
President William Ruto is now accusing unnamed
foreign entities of being behind the countrywide demos against his
administration.
Speaking
in Kajiado County while officiating the commissioning of the Kimuka sub-station,
the Head of State alleged involvement of foreign elements outside the country
in fuelling the protests.
“Wale
wanajaribu kufanya mambo kule ng’ambo sijui wapi kupangapanga mambo ya nini,
mimi nataka niwaambie Kenya is a democratic nation and this is our country na Kenya
hatuhami,” he said.
In
the Wednesday address, the President appeared to have resumed official duties
since the storming of Parliament on June 25, 2024.
In
an apparent reference to calls for him to leave office, President Ruto said
Kenyans will have an opportunity to express their views in the 2027 General Election.
Ruto
exuded confidence in tone and manner pushing back on the recent spate of
protests saying there are no shortcuts and people should wait for the next
elections to elect new leaders.
“So,
hakuna haja ya kuharibu amani ya nchi, hakuna haja ulete fujo Kenya, hakuna
haja ya kujaribu kutumia njia ya mkato. Wananchi hawa ni werevu na ndio
wataamua vile Kenya itasonga mbele,” he said.
For
the last three weeks, youthful protestors identifying themselves as the Gen Z have
been conducting intense demonstrations across the country calling for among
other things President Ruto's resignation from office.
The
protests have been powered through online platforms under the hashtag ‘Ruto
must go,’ But Ruto has fired back saying Kenyans will have their say through elections.
“Hapo
2027 tutafanya mtihani na hawa wananchi. So hakuna haja ya kusumbuana hapa
katikati, wacha tungojee hii mtihani tuone nani wa kupita, nani wa kuanguka,”
he noted.
President
Ruto has been under intense pressure from protestors who accuse his
administration of broken promises, arrogance and impunity.
He
has for the last one week been hinting at changes in government, the latest
hint suggesting what the President called a broad-based political arrangement.
Some have
interpreted the hint as a pointer to a potential government of national unity preceded
by changes in government. But at this stage all that remains speculative.

Kenyans online are protesting the increased
police abduction of activists and protesters who have been vocal against the unpopular
Finance Bill 2024.
Ahead of Tuesday’s nationwide demonstrations
against the proposed law, social media reports emerged that key figures in the
youth-led peaceful protests had been arrested and their whereabouts remained
unknown.
They include Gabriel Oguda, a popular
social commentator and vocal critic of President William Ruto’s government, whom reports
say was abducted in the wee hours of Tuesday.
Oguda’s brother Zachary posted online that the newspaper columnist was whisked away from his house by men believed to be police officers.
“Any tweets coming from @gabrieloguda were
already scheduled. HE ISN’T SAFE,” Zachary added in a post some minutes past 4 a.m.
Others are people behind the X pages Franje,
Drey Mwangi and Osama Otero, among others.
The latest cases add to other protesters who were captured over the weekend such as Shadrak Kiprono, alias Shad Khalif, who was abducted on Saturday night in Nairobi’s South B area and whose whereabouts remain unclear.
The Law Society of Kenya (LSK) in a statement on Tuesday morning condemned the abductions as a return to darkness. LSK President Faith Odhiambo vowed that the lawyers' body will bring those orchestrating the abductions to book.
""Over the last 72 hrs, Kenya has been drawn back to the dark era of a rogue, irrational police force operating through repressive, retrogressive, clandestine, illegal, extra-judicial tactics to forcefully quell public dissent against misgivings of government, lapses in governance and more specifically, the contentious Finance Bill 2024,"" Odhiambo said.
""We will unmask and take action against these rogue criminal elements putting our police in ruin.""
Some protesters were released before Tuesday after a public uproar; Dr Austin Omondi, alias Ja Prado, was released on Sunday night.
Omondi was running a blood donation drive
for injured protesters at Sikh Union along Nairobi’s Forest Road and is said to
have been captured by individuals in a vehicle bearing the registration number
KCU 819H.
Prominent X user Billy Simani, alias Crazy
Nairobian, was on Saturday evening released from police custody following his
arrest on Friday.
Kenya Human Rights
Commission (KHRC) on Monday also condemned the
abductions and called for an immediate cessation of this trend.
“The abductions, often
occurring at night and carried out by police officers in plain clothes and
unmarked vehicles, aim to intimidate protesters planning to participate in
future peaceful demonstrations urging MPs to reject the bill,” KHRC said.
LSK at the time also called for the
unconditional and immediate release of the abductees.
Two people have so far
died from police-inflicted injuries since the anti-Finance Bill demonstrations began last Tuesday.
A nationwide strike dubbed #TotalShutdownKE is on Tuesday scheduled to take place across all counties, especially in Nairobi's central business district, to pressure parliamentarians to shoot down the bill this week.

Published on: July 09, 2024 07:20 (EAT)
A Boeing jetliner taking off from Los Angeles lost a wheel Monday, the latest in a string of safety scares for the aerospace giant.
United Airlines, which operated the Boeing 757-200, said the plane lost the wheel after leaving Los Angeles International Airport but landed safely in Denver, its intended destination.
""The wheel has been recovered in Los Angeles, and we are investigating what caused this event,"" the airline said in statement.
No injuries were reported from the ground or the 174 passengers and seven crew members on board.
It was the second time in recent months that a Boeing plane operated by United Airlines lost a wheel after taking off.
In March, a Boeing 777 bound for Japan had a tire fall off shortly after takeoff from San Francisco. The aircraft had to make an emergency landing.
Boeing agreed Monday to plead guilty to fraud in a settlement with the US Department of Justice over two fatal 737 MAX crashes.
Boeing has faced renewed scrutiny of the 737 MAX this year after a fuselage door plug blew out on the same model during an Alaska Airlines flight in January.
A Boeing spokesperson said in an email that the 757-200 aircraft that took off Monday was first delivered 30 years ago in 1994.
Production of the 757 model was discontinued in 2004.
The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating Monday's incident.

According to Ndia sub-county Police Commander Moses Koskei, the suspect who was being sought by the detectives went to Baricho police station and identified himself as the suspect who is being accused of Killing the 7-year-old.
He had gone into hiding after the incident on Thursday last week.
The police boss said the suspect told the police he was fearing for his life and he had gone into hiding after he heard residents of Baricho wanted to kill him.
“The suspect is right now being held here at Baricho police station as detectives continue with investigation. We are going to ask the court to allow us detain him as we continue with investigations,” Koskei said.
According to Alice Karuana Muriithi, her daughter went missing Thursday before she was discovered tied with banana fibres in river Gakungu on Friday.
Karuana said her daughter had gone to the Baricho shopping centre in the company of her cousin before she went missing.
The suspect is said to be a bhang peddler and is reported to have once raped his mother.

Speaking at the KICC while President Ruto signed the IEBC bill into law, Kalonzo stated that if the old guard is not careful, Kenyan youth, particularly Generation Z, will wipe them out.
""If we are not careful all of us will be thrown out by the Gen Z because they say they have come of age... you say we are leaders of tomorrow but we are leaders of now. We can't wish them away,"" Kalonzo warned.
The former vice president requested that Ruto expedite the recommendations of the NADCO report, which was prepared by a committee he co-chaired, citing the assent to law of the IEBC bill as one of the recommendations.
Further, Kalonzo asked Ruto to fire Inspector General of Police Japheth Koome following the killing of 42 people during the peaceful protests.
""Order IG Japeth Koome to resign and take responsibility for the deaths of the 42 young Kenyans who lost their lives because they were exercising their constitutional rights to peaceably assemble, demonstrate and picket. Mr President, the Army should be ordered off our streets and sent back to the barracks,"" he added.
Kalonzo's warning comes after weeks of youth-led street protests opposing the punitive Finance Bill 2024 and demanding accountability from the government.
The climax of the protests saw demonstrators breach parliament, leading to the shooting of several protesters by security forces.
The protests prompted Ruto to reject the bill in totality, and pledged to effect austerity measures to reduce government spending.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/julius-malemas-eff-party-condemns-kenyan-police-brutality-in-anti-finance-bill-demos-n344718,"Julius Malema's EFF party condemns Kenyan police brutality in anti-Finance Bill demos
South African opposition leader Julius
Malema’s Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party has condemned the Kenya Police’s
violent quelling of protesters in Tuesday’s demonstrations against the Finance
Bill 2024.
In a statement on Wednesday, EFF termed the
use of live ammunition on unarmed citizens by Kenyan police as unacceptable and
a violation of human rights.
“Instead of de-escalating the conflict, the
Kenyan government chose to exacerbate it by deploying police, and have also
chosen to deploy the army under the guise of addressing a ‘security emergency’,”
EFF said.
The party criticised President William Ruto’s
comments that “organised criminals” had hijacked discourse on the unpopular proposed
law, through which his government seeks to hike taxes.
Ruto in a televised address in the evening
termed Tuesday’s events a threat to national security and vowed to crack down
on the “planners, financiers, orchestrators and abetters of violence and
anarchy.”
He deployed the military to back the police
force’s security enforcement.
But EFF sees Ruto’s language as a
demonstration of disregard for Kenyans’ grievances.
“This oppressive response highlights the
President's willingness to resort to deadly force to push through his Finance
Bill, which clearly serves the interests of Western powers at the expense of
his own citizens,” reads the statement.
“Deploying the military against your own
people is simply unethical. The role of the military is to protect the nation,
not to confront unarmed protesters with legitimate grievances.”
The party urged President Ruto to stop “the
violent suppression of protesters, withdraw the military and police from the
streets, and engage in meaningful dialogue with the citizens of Kenya.”
“The EFF stands in solidarity with the
people of Kenya in their struggle against oppressive governance and economic
exploitation,” Malema’s party said.
Tuesday’s demonstrations culminated in
violent scenes as crowds broke through police lines and breached Parliament
buildings in Nairobi after legislators passed the bill, which now awaits
presidential assent to become law.
The ceremonial mace, which symbolizes the
authority of the legislature, was stolen, some parts of the parliament building
vandalised and a section of it set on fire.
Police fired live ammunition at the mob,
killing at least five people and injuring over 30 others, according to Amnesty
International.
Over 125 people were injured in the day’s
events, the human rights organisation HAKI Africa said.
The United Nations Secretary-General
Antonio Guterres on Wednesday urged Kenyan authorities to restrain from
violence and pave the way for peaceful demonstrations.
Moussa Faki, the African Union Commission
chairperson, urged stakeholders to exercise calm and welcome constructive
dialogue.

LeBron James will return to the Los Angeles Lakers next season after agreeing a new two-year $104 million deal with the club, multiple US reports said Wednesday.
James, who will turn 40 in December, opted out of his existing deal with the club last week in a move analysts said would free up more money to recruit new players.
The NBA superstar had been widely expected to re-sign with the Lakers particularly after the team drafted his eldest son, Bronny James, last week.
James has long spoken of his desire to play in the NBA alongside his son.
ESPN and The Athletic said James' new deal included a no-trade clause, meaning he cannot be traded to another club without his consent.
The four-time NBA champion, the league's all-time leading points scorer, will be playing his 22nd season in 2024-2025.
He led the Lakers to an NBA championship in 2020, but has struggled to take the team back to the summit of the sport since then.
This year the Lakers were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs.
The Lakers subsequently appointed James' podcast partner and television commentator J.J. Redick as head coach last month following the dismissal of Darvin Ham.

Hundreds of people marched in the Kenyan capital Nairobi Sunday, to honour those who died in anti-government demonstrations this week, as President William Ruto insisted that: ""I have no blood on my hands.""
Rights groups say at least 30 people died in protests driven by a government drive to substantially raise taxes in the East African country.
Following the violence, Ruto announced an about-turn earlier this week, saying he would ""listen to the people"" and would not sign the finance bill into law.
Ruto, in a television interview, put the toll at 19 -- the first figures issued by the authorities -- and promised a full investigation into the deaths.
Largely peaceful rallies turned violent last Tuesday when lawmakers passed the deeply unpopular tax increases following pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
Police opened fire on protesters who stormed the parliament complex and a fire broke out.
""I have no blood on my hands,"" said Ruto during the interview with Kenyan TV.
Referring to the deaths, he said: ""It is very unfortunate. As a democracy that should not be part of our conversation...""
""There will be an investigation on how these 19 Kenyans died,"" he added. ""There will be an explanation for each and every one of them.
""The police have done the best they could,"" said Ruto.
""If there have been any excesses, we have mechanisms to make sure that those excesses are dealt with.""
And he added: ""Any killer cop who went beyond what is provided for in the law will have action taken against them.""
- 'We will catch' criminals -
But he warned that those who had attacked parliament would also be held accountable.
""Criminals infiltrated and caused mayhem,"" he said. ""Those who attacked Parliament and the judiciary are on CCTV.""
""Many of them are on the run but we will catch them,"" he added.
Going back over his decision to scrap the finance bill at the last moment, Ruto said: ""It means that we have gone back almost two years"" and meant the government would have to borrow heavily.
But he acknowledged: ""We should have communicated better.
""If I am given a chance to explain to the people of Kenya what the finance bill was all about and what it would have done for them, then every Kenyan would agree with me.""
The clashes were unprecedented in the history of the country since its independence from Britain in 1963.
On Saturday, a few hundred people gathered in Uhuru Park in central Nairobi following an appeal on media.
After singing and lighting candles, they waved Kenyan flags and chanted as they marched past the hospital where some of the injured protesters are being treated.
Demonstrators dispersed peacefully late in the afternoon.

Speaking to the diplomatic corps in Nairobi, Mudavadi emphasised the negative impact of violent protests on the country's stability and economic growth.
Mudavadi acknowledged the public's right to protest, but emphasised the importance of conducting demonstrations lawfully and peacefully.
He expressed concern about criminals infiltrating protests, resulting in widespread looting and property destruction.
“The right to peaceful protest is enshrined in our constitution, and it must be protected. However, we cannot condone the actions of those who exploit these protests to engage in criminal activities,” Mudavadi stated.
“Such actions not only undermine the legitimacy of the protesters' grievances but also inflict harm on innocent citizens and businesses.”
Mudavadi also outlined the government’s efforts to address the issues raised by the demonstrators, including ongoing dialogue and proposed policy reforms.
He emphasised the government's commitment to finding a peaceful solution to the current crisis.
Mudavadi also urged the international community to support Kenya's efforts to maintain peace and stability.
He urged diplomatic representatives to communicate the importance of nonviolent protests to their respective governments and to discourage any external interference that could worsen the situation.
“Kenya is a nation of laws, and we must all work together to ensure that our democratic processes are respected. Violence and chaos will only set us back,” he added.
The Prime Cabinet Secretary's statement comes against the backdrop of rising tensions and ongoing demonstrations across the country.
With the death toll rising and numerous injuries reported, Mudavadi’s appeal for peace and stability is a crucial step in addressing the ongoing unrest.

In the new era of interaction between humans and machines, technology providers are working towards enhancing interface efficiency. This is by enabling more active interfacing by AI models.
Speaking during the MWC Shanghai 2024 Summit, David Wang, Huawei Executive Director of the Board and Chairman of the ICT Infrastructure Managing Board noted that by accelerating 5G-A, technology companies will connect more people through the Mobile AI Era.
The company announced its success in reaching six separate consensuses with pioneering 5G-A operators from around the world, and launched a joint initiative for high-quality mobile video development in the AI era alongside global operators, industry customers, and other relevant organizations.
“2024 marks the beginning of the mobile AI era thanks to the commercial launch of 5G-A and other AI devices. These technologies will be the key to making intelligent services ubiquitous. This era will transform not only human-machine interaction, but also content production and mobile devices, and will revitalize society and create opportunities for the mobile industry,” noted Wang.
Leading operators around the world are already looking to capitalize on 5G-A as more than 30 operators have already completed 5G-A technical verification.
There are nearly 20 mobile phone models on the market that can currently support multi-carrier aggregation, with a number of them supporting activating the feature by default.
In her opening remarks during the Summit, GSMA CMO, Lara Dewar said that AI’s potential for disruption can no longer be disputed, while advocating for equal access to skills so that all people benefit from the technology.
Dewar added that to enhance customer experiences, innovators have to put people first and build technology ethically.
As the Mobile AI Era gains momentum, players in different fields share breakthroughs and challenges presented by the technology.
Yang Lan, the chairperson of the Sun Media Group said that even though AI has caused a major disruption in the art industry, there is room for a cordial relationship between artists and innovators of the technology.
“AI artists need to be good learners, creative, have standards. They need to come up with original ideas and standards,” she said.
Lan also remarked that currently, AI models fail in generating new knowledge and fairness. The models also lack sociability, new art capabilities, and general awareness in artistic skills.

Lionel Messi said he was enjoying his ""last battles"" with Argentina after the 37-year-old found the net in a 2-0 win over Canada on Tuesday to book a place in the Copa America final.
After a lacklustre display against Ecuador in the quarter-finals, Messi looked back to himself again, connecting with Angel Di Maria and strike partner Julian Alvarez, who also scored.
""I'm living it like I lived it in the last Copa America, in the last World Cup....these are the last battles and I'm enjoying them to the maximum,"" he told TyC Sports after the win set up a meeting with Uruguay or Colombia in the final.
Messi, now playing with Inter Miami in Major League Soccer, has yet to indicate whether he will continue to play with Argentina in the 2026 World Cup, which will feature a final at the New Jersey venue.
But asked about Messi's ""last battles"" comment, Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni asked for calm.
""We have to leave him alone, he knows that we will not be the ones to close the door on him. He can stay with us as long as he wants, even when he retires...Let him decide what he wants,"" he said.
Messi has chance to win a third straight major title with his national side following their 2022 World Cup triumph and their 2021 Copa America win.
The eight-time Ballon d'Or winner referenced veteran team-mates Di Maria and Nicolas Otamendi and said that the success was validation for the difficult barren years the team had suffered.
""The truth is that it's crazy what this group has done, what the Argentina national team has been doing, because after all this it gives value to all (the tournaments) I and the old generation have played in,"" Messi said on TyC Sports.
""It's not easy for us to be in a final again, for us to compete again to be champions,"" he added after the victory at MetLife Stadium.
Despite Argentina reaching the final with some comfort against Canada, the former Barcelona forward said it had been a tough test so far.
""It's a difficult Copa, evenly matched, with very bad pitches, with high temperatures, very tough teams, and for us to be in a final again is something to enjoy,"" he said.
Goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez said that despite being world champions the joy of reaching a final was just as intense as ever.
""It's a source of pride as an Argentine, as a representative of this national team, to be able to play in another final. It feels as if it was the first time,"" he said.

""The statements made by the 2nd Respondent during a press conference held on Wednesday, 25th June 2024, are misconceived, improper, untruthful, and unlawful. They were made with the intent to incite hatred against the concerned party and fall short of the standards expected from a public officer of his position as the Deputy President of Kenya,"" reads the court papers.
Through lawyer Danstan Omari, Bikeri argues that the National Cohesion and Integration Commission has the responsibility to investigate the utterances by Gachagua.
""The statements made by the 2nd Respondent were intended to bring disrepute to the offices of the Director of Public Prosecution and the National Intelligence Service, and they constitute a breach of Article 10 of the Constitution on National Values and Principles,"" the court documents further read.
Gachagua on Wednesday demanded that Haji step down from his position to pave the way for a more competent Director General.
Addressing the press in Mombasa, a seemingly agitated DP blamed the NIS for the current anti-government protests which he said have led to deaths and destruction.

https://www.citizen.digital/lifestyle/hiv-breakthrough-drug-trial-shows-injection-twice-a-year-is-100-effective-against-infection-n345126,"HIV breakthrough: Drug trial shows injection twice a year is 100% effective against infection
A large clinical trial in South Africa and Uganda has shown that a twice-yearly injection of a new pre-exposure prophylaxis drug gives young women total protection from HIV infection.
The trial tested whether the six-month injection of lenacapavir would provide better protection against HIV infection than two other drugs, both daily pills. All three medications are pre-exposure prophylaxis (or PrEP) drugs.
Physician-scientist Linda-Gail Bekker, principal investigator for the South African part of the study, tells Nadine Dreyer what makes this breakthough so significant and what to expect next.
Tell us about the trial and what it set out to achieve
The Purpose 1 trial with 5,000 participants took place at three sites in Uganda and 25 sites in South Africa to test the efficacy of lenacapavir and two other drugs.
Lenacapavir (Len LA) is a fusion capside inhibitor. It interferes with the HIV capsid, a protein shell that protects HIV’s genetic material and enzymes needed for replication. It is administered just under the skin, once every six months.
The randomised controlled trial, sponsored by the drug developers Gilead Sciences, tested several things.
The first was whether a six-monthly injection of lenacapavir was safe and would provide better protection against HIV infection as PrEP for women between the ages of 16 and 25 years than Truvada F/TDF, a daily PrEP pill in wide use that has been available for more than a decade.
Secondly, the trial also tested whether Descovy F/TAF, a newer daily pill, was as effective as F/TDF. The newer F/TAF has superior pharmacokinetic properties to F/TDF. Pharmacokinetic refers to the movement of a drug into, through, and out of the body. F/TAF is a smaller pill and is in use among men and transgender women in high-income countries.
The trial had three arms. Young women were randomly assigned to one of the arms in a 2:2:1 ratio (Len LA: F/TAF oral: F/TDF oral) in a double blinded fashion. This means neither the participants nor the researchers knew which treatment participants were receiving until the clinical trial was over.
In eastern and southern Africa, young women are the population who bear the brunt of new HIV infections. They also find a daily PrEP regimen challenging to maintain, for a number of social and structural reasons.
During the randomised phase of the trial none of the 2,134 women who received lenacapavir contracted HIV. There was 100 percent efficiency.
By comparison, 16 of the 1,068 women (or 1.5%) who took Truvada (F/TDF) and 39 of 2,136 (1.8%) who received Descovy (F/TAF) contracted the HIV virus.
The results at a recent independent data safety monitoring board review led to the recommendation that the trial’s “blinded” phase should be stopped and all participants should be offered a choice of PrEP.
This board is an independent committee of experts who are put in place at the start of a clinical trial. They see the unblinded data at stipulated times during the trial to monitor progress and safety. They ensure that a trial does not continue if there is harm or a clear benefit in one arm over others.
What is the significance of these trials?
This breakthrough gives great hope that we have a proven, highly effective prevention tool to protect people from HIV.
There were 1.3 million new HIV infections globally in the past year. Although that’s fewer than the 2 million infections seen in 2010, it is clear that at this rate we are not going to meet the HIV new infection target that UNAIDS set for 2025 (fewer than 500,000 globally) or potentially even the goal to end Aids by 2030.
PrEP is not the only prevention tool.
PrEP should be provided alongside HIV self-testing, access to condoms, screening and treatment for sexually transmitted infections and access to contraception for women of childbearing potential.
In addition, young men should be offered medical male circumcision for health reasons.
But despite these options, we haven’t quite got to the point where we have been able to stop new infections, particularly among young people.
For young people, the daily decision to take a pill or use a condom or take a pill at the time of sexual intercourse can be very challenging.
HIV scientists and activists hope that young people may find that having to make this “prevention decision” only twice a year may reduce unpredictability and barriers.
For a young woman who struggles to get to an appointment at a clinic in a town or who can’t keep pills without facing stigma or violence, an injection just twice a year is the option that could keep her free of HIV.
What happens now?
The plan is that the Purpose 1 trial will go on but now in an “open label” phase. This means that study participants will be “unblinded”: they will be told whether they have been in the “injectable” or oral TDF or oral TAF groups.
They will be offered the choice of PrEP they would prefer as the trial continues.
A sister trial is also under way: Purpose 2 is being conducted in a number of regions including some sites in Africa among cisgender men, and transgender and nonbinary people who have sex with men.
It’s important to conduct trials among different groups because we have seen differences in effectiveness. Whether the sex is anal or vaginal is important and may have an impact on effectiveness.
How long until the drug is rolled out?
We have read in a Gilead Sciences press statement that within the next couple of months the company will submit the dossier with all the results to a number of country regulators, particularly the Ugandan and South African regulators.
The World Health Organization will also review the data and may issue recommendations.
We hope then that this new drug will be adopted into WHO and country guidelines.
We also hope we may begin to see the drug being tested in more studies to understand better how to incorporate it into real world settings.
Price is a critical factor to ensure access and distribution in the public sector where it is badly needed.
Gilead Sciences has said it will offer licences to companies that make generic drugs, which is another critical way to get prices down.
In an ideal world, governments will be able to purchase this affordably and it will be offered to all who want it and need protection against HIV.

Multiple world champion and two-time Olympic 1500 metres champion
Faith Kipyegon has promised to break more records in future, following her
phenomenal display at the Paris Diamond League on Sunday, July 7, 2024 where
she broke her own 1500m record.
Kipyegon clocked 3:49.04 to shatter the world record by

https://www.citizen.digital/opinion-blogs/opinion-we-need-more-digital-and-innovative-financial-solutions-for-msmes-beyond-credit-n345141,"OPINION: We need more digital and innovative financial solutions for MSMEs beyond credit
Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are the backbone of Kenya's economy, contributing significantly to innovation and economic growth.
According to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) Economic Survey2022, MSMEs account for 33.8% of the national output and are pivotal in realizing Vision 2030 development aspirations, particularly in trade, manufacturing, agriculture, tourism, and financial services.
MSME’s account for over 90% of private sector enterprises in Kenya, playing a crucial role in the decentralized economic development model promoted by devolution that aims to achieve equitable social and economic development across the country.
As we marked the World MSMEDay on June 27th, the significance of these enterprises was highlighted. Despite their critical role in economic growth and job creation, MSMEs face significant challenges, including high rates of business closure within the first year of operation.
To address these challenges and ensure sustainable growth, there is a pressing need for digital and innovative financial products and services beyond traditional credit offerings. These solutions can provide MSMEs with the tools and resources necessary to thrive in an increasingly digital economy.
MSMEs are essential for economic development, providing employment opportunities and contributing to poverty alleviation and inclusive growth. The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8 underscores the importance of MSMEs in creating decent work and economic growth.
The Government’s economic Transformation initiative further highlights the potential of MSMEs to generate employment and livelihood opportunities, especially for marginalized groups. However, despite the introduction of favourable policies over the years, a significant proportion of MSMEs continue to face financial constraints, limiting their ability to thrive and expand.
I&M Bank's initiatives to support MSMEs through flexible working capital solutions illustrate the need for financial products that go beyond traditional credit. I&M Bank's initiative to waive transaction fees for transfers between bank accounts and mobile wallets demonstrates the potential of digital payments to reduce operational costs and deepen financial inclusion.
This integration allows MSMEs to conduct seamless financial transactions, enhancing their operational efficiency and reducing the cost of doing business.
These solutions among others help MSMEs manage cash flows and invest in the supply chain, enhancing their operational efficiency and scalability. By offering business insurance products and supply chain financing, banks can provide comprehensive financial support that addresses various aspects of business operations.
The introduction of unsecured digital lending products by banks in recent years has revolutionized access to finance for MSMEs.
These products, accessible via mobile apps, offer faster and more efficient loan application and renewal processes, enabling businesses to access funds quickly and conveniently. Such innovations are crucial in a digital era where speed and accessibility can significantly impact business success.
The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the vulnerability of MSMEs to external shocks. Digital insurance products and risk management solutions can provide a safety net for these businesses, protecting them from unforeseen events and ensuring business continuity.
These products are particularly beneficial for women and youth entrepreneurs who may face additional challenges in accessing traditional financial services.
Technology today plays a pivotal role in the provision of innovative financial services. Digital platforms enable financial institutions to interact with MSMEs efficiently, from application and onboarding to monitoring and fund disbursement.
This digital transformation not only strengthens the connection between financial institutions and MSMEs but also empowers businesses with digital intelligence, enhancing their decision-making capabilities.
The expansion of the financial ecosystem for MSMEs requires collaboration among various stakeholders, including financial institutions, fintech companies, government bodies, and international organizations. By fostering partnerships and leveraging the strengths of each stakeholder, we can create a more inclusive and supportive financial environment for MSMEs.
The integration of mobile money platforms with banking systems is one such collaborative effort that hasrevolutionized financial transactions in Kenya, providing MSMEs with greater flexibility and accessibility.
Leveraging data analytics and artificial intelligence can provide MSMEs with valuable insights into their financial health and market trends that financial institutions can use to offer personalized financial products and advisory services, helping MSMEs make informed decisions and improve their business strategies.
The need for digital and innovative financial products and services for MSMEs must extend far beyond traditional credit products. By providing flexible working capital solutions, integrating mobile wallets, offering digital insuranceand leveraging technology, financial institutions can create a conducive environment for MSMEs to thrive.
These innovations are essential for addressing the financial access gap and ensuring the sustainable growth of MSMEs, ultimately driving economic development and reducing inequality.
As we move towards a more digital and data-driven financial landscape, it is crucial to continue developing and implementing financial solutions that cater to the diverse needs of MSMEs, ensuring their resilience and success in an ever-changing economic environment.

The Kenya Kabaddi team is fresh off their victory at the Africa Championship,
having defeated Uganda 44-23 at Kasarani indoors in Nairobi.
While assuring them of the government’s commitment to support their course,
Namwamba highlighted plans to embed Kabaddi into the school co-curricular ecosystem.
""The first thing we are going to do is to see how to integrate Kabaddi in
the school co-curricular ecosystem so that during the school games, Kabaddi can
also be a sport,"" he stated.
Namwamba also elaborated on the long-term vision that will help develop the
game in Kenya, emphasizing the importance of establishing a continuous flow of
talent.
""We will spread the game across the country and build a formidable talent
pipeline coming through all the way from the school ecosystem to the national
level. This will ensure a steady stream of talents from schools to colleges, to
clubs, and ultimately to the national ecosystem,"" he said.
Namwamba underscored the role of sports in promoting Kenya's image globally.
""Sports are the most significant export that Kenya sends to the world.
It's what markets Kenya more than anything else. Kenya is best known around the
world as a sporting country, and you are now part of that very proud heritage
of great sportsmen and women who fly our flag.""
He also highlighted the broader vision for sports development in Kenya.
""We want to support all sports because it's an important platform for our young people and youth. It’s also a great unifier that brings our people together. And now, sports is a big industry for us that we want to commercialize to generate jobs and support livelihood for our young people,"" he added.

The Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU) has called off plans to occupy the Ministry of Health's premises at Afya House in Nairobi.
KMPDU had announced plans to occupy the premises on Monday, July 8, to ensure that all medical interns are posted to health facilities nationwide in line with the 2017 Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).
Taking to X on Monday morning, KMPDU made a U-turn on their plans and said that the decision has been prompted by ongoing discussions to ensure that the CBA agreement is met.
""We remain vigilant and committed to achieving fair outcomes for all interns,"" they wrote.
The CBA was ratified in May following a 56-day nationwide doctors' strike as part of a return-to-work formula (RTWF) inked between the union and the government.
KMPDU Secretary General Davji Atellah had previously highlighted that the union has been holding a series of meetings with the aim of implementing the return-to-work formula at Kenyatta National Hospital and the Ministry of Health.
According to Atellah, the internship posting debacle was to be resolved within 60 days as per the 2017 CBA.
""As we all know, the 60 days end on 7th of July 2024. So far we are in agreement with the Ministry of Health that interns must be posted as per CBA 2017 before the lapse of the 60-day negotiation window as per our Return to Work Formula,"" Atellah said then.
""The Ministry of Health is to have an engagement with Treasury before our final meeting set for Thursday, 4th July 2024.""
Minutes after this publication Atellah claimed that the union's account has been hacked, maintaining that the march is still on.

In a strongly-worded statement shared online, the opposition leader accused the government of brutality and murder against peaceful demonstrators.
Raila further noted that the country is paying a “steep price for the obstinacy” of the government, following Tuesday's events.
He expressed deep concern over the violent crackdown on young protesters demanding changes to taxation policies; matters he feels, should have been resolved through dialogue.
“Matters that should have been resolved through dialogue and humility have degenerated into developments that have never been witnessed in the 61-year history of our country since Independence,” he added.
Raila’s remarks as at least five deaths were reported due to clashes between protesters and security forces.
“I am disturbed at the murders, arrests, detentions and surveillance being perpetrated by police on boys and girls who are only seeking to be heard over taxation policies that are stealing both their present and future,” Raila said.
He further criticized the government for what he termed as the supposed suspension of constitutional rights, citing murders, arrests, and detentions during the demonstrations.
“The constitution seems to have been suspended. We cannot allow that. The government has unleashed brute force on our country's children and more seems to be on the way,” he noted.
He reiterated his call to have the Finance Bill 2024 suspended, noting that the grievances and frustrations of those protesting run extremely deep and wide.
""Police must therefore immediately stop shooting innocent, peaceful and unarmed protesting children who are asking for guarantees of a better tomorrow from the State.""
Looking back at similar standoffs in the past that were resolved through dialogue,Raila called on the government to engage in meaningful talks with Kenyans over the contentious Finance Bill 2024.
""The starting point to ending this impasse and cruel bloodletting is for the government to immediately and unconditionally withdraw the Finance Bill and make way for a fresh start and dialogue.""
He appealed to regional and global bodies, including the East African Community, the African Union, and the United Nations, to intervene and address what he described as a crisis endangering lives and freedoms in Kenya.
""I am calling on the East African Community, the African Union and the United Nations to immediately be seized of the unfolding situation in Kenya to save lives and the country.""

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/england-turnaround-penalty-torment-to-reach-euros-semis-n345387,"England turnaround penalty torment to reach Euros semis
Published on: July 07, 2024 06:39 (EAT)

England's history at major tournaments is littered with penalty pain but they put that tortured past behind them to beat Switzerland and reach the semi-finals of Euro 2024.
The Three Lions were perfect from the spot with all five kicks in Duesseldorf, while goalkeeper Jordan Pickford continued his fine penalty record by saving from Manuel Akanji.
It was quite a contrast to the penalty heartbreak that Gareth Southgate's England side went through three years ago when they lost the final of Euro 2020 on home soil.
As a player Southgate also suffered the ignominy that comes with missing in a shoot-out more than most after his penalty was saved in the Euro 96 semi-final exit to Germany.
But the England manager's attention to detail is helping turn the tide on their record with three wins from four shoot-outs under his watch.
England won a World Cup shoot-out for the first time in their history against Colombia in 2018 en route to the semi-finals.
Victory in Saturday's quarter-final was just their second ever in a Euros in six attempts, while they also beat the Swiss in a third-place playoff at the 2019 Nations League finals.
""We think we've got a good process. We’ve been in four, we've won three,""said Southgate.
""Of course, we got absolutely crucified for the one we lost and that’s always going to be the case because it is outcome based.
""We refined that process a little bit. We have more regular penalty takers in the squad now than then and more that have been in shoot-outs.""
England's poise from the spot was all the more impressive with Harry Kane replaced in extra-time due to fatigue.
The average age of the five takers was just over 23 and all had their own point to prove.
Bukayo Saka, who kept England in the tournament with a stunning strike 10 minutes from time, made amends after missing the decisive penalty in the shoot-out against Italy three years ago.
""You can fail once but you have a choice of whether or not you're going to put yourself in that position again. I'm a guy that's going to put myself in that position,"" said Saka.
""I believed in myself and when I saw the ball hit the net I was a very happy man.""
Ivan Toney replaced Kane and justified his inclusion in the squad as a penalty specialist.
Cole Palmer is yet to start a match in Germany, while Trent Alexander-Arnold was dropped after failing to take his chance in a midfield role.
Meanwhile, Jude Bellingham had been cleared to play just a day before the Switzerland clash after a UEFA investigation into his crotch grab celebration to save England from an embarrassing exit to Slovakia in the last 16.
Southgate has long dismissed the cliche that penalties are a lottery.
While working as a TV pundit, he suggested after England's exit at Euro 2012 the need for players to work with a psychologist.
In his eight years in charge, he has employed specialists to help on the finest details, including breathing techniques and the optimal time for players to take a penalty to avoid rushing the process.
That work has borne fruit in three wins from four compared to one win in seven prior to his appointment.
""It’s my responsibility but on a night like tonight it’s the players that deliver,"" added Southgate.
""What I want to do is take the pressure for them. They were so composed. The whole process was really calm.""
Southgate also reserved special praise for his goalkeeper.
Pickford's energetic, at times manic, demeanour does not portray an ice cold temperament.
Yet, he is a specialist under the most intense pressure.
The Everton stopper has saved at least one penalty in every shoot-out he has been involved in.
Even in the one he lost at Wembley three years ago, Pickford saved two of Italy's five penalties.
His preparation was picked up by the cameras with a water bottle that had instructions of where to dive for every Swiss penalty taker.
""The goalkeeper will always make at least one save, so that gives us another chance,"" Southgate added.

Some concertgoers have demanded justice for those killed by rogue police officers, exercising their democratic right.
Kenyan entertainers and activists who continue to rally the youth against bad leadership were among those in attendance.
Security was beefed up in the city's Central Business District (CBD) and key government installations ahead of the Sunday concert.
Protesters erected makeshift crosses bearing the names of Kenyans who died during anti-tax protests.
The white crosses were adorned with the Kenyan flag.
The Shujaaz memorial concert, which coincides with the historical Saba Saba day—a commemoration of July 7, 1990 protests that agitated for multi-party democracy—was the culmination of protests that had been ongoing for three weeks.
The protesters, the majority of whom are disenfranchised Kenyan youth, have demanded that the government take action against runway corruption, unchecked spending, and an overhaul of Kenya's parliament.
While the state claims that 25 people have been killed and 400 have been injured, rights groups believe the numbers are higher.
According to the Kenya Human Rights Commission (KHRC), at least 43 people were killed during the demonstrations, and over 600 were injured in varying degrees.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/police-deny-stopping-kennedy-onyangos-burial-say-father-claimed-the-body-n345352,"Police deny stopping Kennedy Onyango's burial, say father claimed the body
The National Police Service (NPS) has
dismissed claims of refusing to release the body of 12-year-old Kennedy
Onyango, who was killed during anti-government protests in Ongata Rongai,
for burial in Mbita on Saturday.
Inspector
General of Police Japhet Koome confirmed that the body of the minor was on
Thursday indeed released to the deceased’s mother for burial.
Koome,
however, went on to state that the burial could not take place as planned following
a family tussle after the boy’s alleged biological father moved to court.
“Contrary
to the misleading reports circulating on social media that the National Police
Service has stopped the burial of the late Kennedy Onyango in Mbita
Constituency, we wish to clarify to the public that the body was released to
the mother, Josinter Anyango Ochieng for burial on July 4, 2024,” Koome stated.
“The
body was moved to Mbita for burial but upon arrival on July 5, 2024, one Denish
Okinyi Abaga claiming to be the biological father of the boy appeared with a
court order stopping the burial after he demanded to bury the boy.”
The
IG explained that the court order obtained by the alleged father directed
police to move the body to the Suba mortuary awaiting further court directions.
“Apparently,
the Civil Suit No. 0028 of 2024 filed at Mbita Law Courts ordered the police to
move the body to Suba Sub-County Hospital Funeral Home for preservation, and
the OCS Mbita Police Station complied with the order,” he noted.
IG
Koome further revealed that contrary to reports that the boy was shot eight
times, a postmortem examination report indicates that he died from a single
gunshot wound.
“…This
was after carrying out of the post-mortem by pathologist Dr. Ndegwa P.M. with
the outcome indicating that the boy died due to a single gunshot wound at a
long-range,” stated Koome.
The
police boss has thus urged the public to remain calm as the court deals with
the burial feud.
Government
pathologist Dr. Peter Ndegwa who conducted the postmortem at Ongata Rongai
Sub-County Hospital Funeral Home confirmed that the bullet had shattered his arteries
and punctured his lungs.
According
to his family, Kennedy left the house that fateful day to pick up a book he was
sharing with a neighbouring classmate.
He
would then allegedly be shot eight times as the protests took an ugly turn, in
a night riddled with violence, gunfire and looting.
During
an interview on Sunday, President William Ruto said the Rongai protests were
infiltrated by goons who even took a gun from a police officer and shot into
crowds.
He
said investigations into the incident will reveal whether the boy was indeed shot
by police or by the goons.

(Photo by TIMOTHY A. CLARY / AFP)
Ten-man Colombia defeated Uruguay 1-0 to reach the final of the Copa America for the first time in 23 years after an ill-tempered semi-final on Wednesday.
A 39th-minute Jefferson Lerma header sealed victory for the Colombians, who will now face holders Argentina in Sunday's final in Miami.
It was an anarchic semi-final played in front of a packed and passionate crowd which ended with scuffles on the field and fighting in the stands, including several players who had climbed in among supporters amid the flying punches.
Colombia, despite having Daniel Munoz sent off just before the interval and facing plenty of Uruguay pressure, hung on for a famous victory to the delight of their massive following of fans.
The downtown streets of the North Carolina city were packed with partying fans in bright yellow Colombia jerseys hours before the kick-off.
Inside the 74,800 capacity Bank of America Stadium, it was like a home game in Bogota with only pockets of Uruguayan supporters breaking up the wall of yellow on all four sides of the venue.
Not surprisingly in such an atmosphere, Colombia started strongly with their livewire Liverpool winger Luis Diaz doing well to wriggle some space for a cross on the left, finding Daniel Munoz at the back post but the full-back's header was off target.
Uruguay were, as always, a threat on the counter-attack and their Liverpool star, Darwin Nunez, was close to finishing off one break when Rodrigo Bentancur found him with a clever pass but the forward poked his shot wide.
Nunez had another opening when Maximiliano Araujo played him clear in the inside-right channel but the striker rushed his shot, blasting high and wide.
At the other end, Colombia forced a turnover which led to James Rodriguez curling in a cross from the right but Jhon Cordoba's header was off target.
The breakthrough came in the 39th minute when Lerma rose majestically above Jose Maria Gimenez and powerfully headed home Rodriguez's corner.
It was the sixth assist of the tournament for Rodriguez with the former Real Madrid midfielder beating the record for most assists in a single Copa, which was set by Lionel Messi in 2021.
Colombia looked to make the most of their momentum with Richard Rios forcing a save out of Uruguay keeper Sergio Rochet, after being played in by Munoz.
But having been so influential down the right in the opening half, Munoz lost his head completely, just before the break, picking up a second yellow card, after landing an elbow on Manuel Ugarte.
It was a moment of madness which left Colombia to defend their lead with just 10 men for the entire second half.
Colombia coach Nestor Lorenzo took off Rodriguez, who was also on a yellow card, in the 62nd minute as Uruguay gradually began to turn their numerical advantage into real pressure.
Nicolas de la Cruz threatened with a low drive before substitute Luis Suarez clipped the outside of the post with a drive from the edge of the box after good work from Federico Valverde.
Valverde, the Real Madrid midfielder, then went close himself with a low drive as Colombia's back-line continued to ride their luck.
Giveaway from Uruguay keeper and fell to Mateus Uribe, who despite time and space placed his shot wide of the post.
In stoppage time Uruguay had a great chance to force penalties when Nunez laid the ball off to substitute Giorgian de Arrascaeta on the edge of the box but he leaned back and put his shot over the bar.
There was still time for Uribe to waste another chance to make sure of the win, this time hitting the bar in the final minute, but he will be forgiven his wastefulness by the delirious Colombian supporters.
The celebrations were marred by ugly scenes in the stands will concern organizers CONMEBOL ahead of a final which is sure to attract huge numbers of Argentines as well as Colombians.

""A coalition of terrorist armed groups"" attacked security forces near the village of Tassia, leaving ""21 martyrs including one civilian"" and nine injured, the ministry announced in a statement on national television.
It said ""several dozen"" of the assailants were killed and that aerial and ground reinforcements were being deployed to track down the rest of the attackers.
Three days of national mourning will begin from Wednesday with flags lowered to half-mast, the ministry said, speaking of the security forces' ""unshakeable determination"" to ""continue this fight for sovereignty"".

With 17 days left until the 2024 Olympic Games
in Paris, Kenyan sprinter Wiseman Were is focused on winning his first gold
medal at the quadrennial summer games.
Wiseman has been on the podium three times in
his career but not at the Olympics, a feat he says he’ll be out to achieve.
“We are among three Kenyan sprinters who
qualified for the Olympics together with Africa’s fastest men, Ferdinand
Omanyala and Zablon Ekwam, in the 400m hurdles, 100m, 400m, and 400m hurdles,
respectively,” Wiseman said.
“It means a lot to me because it’s a dream
come true. This is the biggest dream for every athlete because it's an event
that comes every four years, and you can imagine how big a task it is to train
for four years to qualify for the event.
“You go through a lot of hard work, pain, and
determination to qualify.” Said Were.
On 20 April 2024, he won the 400-meter hurdles
at the Kip Keino Classic in Nairobi in a meeting record time of 48.57.
He also ran as part of Kenya's 4x400m relay
team at the 2024 World Relays Championships in Nassau, Bahamas, and in June
2024, he was named on the Kenyan team for the 2024 Paris Olympics.
Were won a bronze at the 2022 Commonwealth
Games with the 4x400m relay team but finished fourth in the final of the 400m
hurdles at the same competition in Birmingham.
“He remains optimistic about his chances of
reaching the finals in the 400m hurdles.
“I’m thankful to have made the team to
Paris; it has been a process and a journey of a thousand miles to be here; a
lot has been involved and sacrificed.
“It's a good feeling to qualify after
struggling to do so in the previous years, but this year, I had no pressure at
all while running.
“At the back of my mind, I knew I was going to
qualify, but at what time?” he said confidently.

In a statement, Amnesty highlighted that 13 people were shot with live bullets, four with rubber bullets and 3 sustained injuries after been hit with teargas canisters.
As a result, over 31 people were injured and five people were shot dead during the protests.
Amnesty also called out the mysterious disappearances orchestrated by uniformed and non-uniformed officers in the past 24 hours.
These included Shadrack Kiprono (now released), Kevin Monari, Zadock Nyamari Monari, Gabriel Oguda, Andrew Mwangi, John Frank Ngemi, Avugwi Chagusia, Chebet Kirui (Nakuru), Brian Nzavi Ngula, Harriet Nyongesa, Chebet Kirui and Ernest Nyerere (now released).
The global body appealed to the State to stop using live ammunition on unarmed medical personnel who were trying to access those injured.
Further, they urged the government to stop issuing threats to shut down media houses. This is after KTN alleged that they received threats to shut down over coverage of the protests.
“We urge the State and all parties to de-escalate the situation and stop the use of lethal force to protect life,” the statement read in part.
“We urge the authorities to desist from reportedly threatening the mass media houses. We appeal for safe medical corridors for all medical personnel and ambulances to access the injured. The scenes of police officers shooting at medical emergency center at Holy Basilica must cease immediately.”
In an unprecedented move, protestors breached parliament and managed to access several protected areas in Nairobi and its environs including City hall. This led to running battles between the anti-riot officers and demonstrators in a battle that lasted for hours.
As a result, several gunshots were fired outside parliament in an attempt by the police to restore peace. This, however, did not deter the protestors who continued with the demonstrations.

(Photo by ANDREJ ISAKOVIC / AFP)
Carlos Alcaraz must put his friendship with Frances Tiafoe to one side as the defending champion targets a place in the Wimbledon last 16 on Friday.
US Open champion Coco Gauff tackles British outsider Sonay Kartal in a collision of two different tennis worlds.
These are the three matches to watch out for on day five at the All England Club:
Alcaraz and Tifoe in friendly fire
Carlos Alcaraz says he will view fellow crowd-pleaser Frances Tiafoe as the enemy when the close friends clash for a place in the second week.
""Once you step on the court, players are not friends. You have to be on your own, focus on yourself, and try to beat him. That's how tennis works,"" said Alcaraz, who is bidding to become only the sixth man to win the French Open and Wimbledon back-to-back.
The Spanish star defeated Tiafoe in a five-set classic in the US Open semi-finals in 2022 on his way to his first Grand Slam title.
""Frances, a great player, a great person as well. He always smiles. He always seems like he's enjoying his time on the court, off the court as well,"" added third seed Alcaraz in admiration.
""It's going to be a really fun match to play, to watch.""
Tiafoe, the world number 29, is in the Wimbledon third round for a fourth successive year.
He needed five sets to see off Italy's Matteo Arnaldi in the first round before cruising past Borna Coric.
With two wins under his belt at the All England Club, it is the first time the 26-year-old has put together consecutive victories at tour level since April.
Worlds collide for Gauff and Kartal
US Open champion and world number two Coco Gauff takes on British qualifier Sonay Kartal, who has defied her humble ranking of 298 to reach the third round of a Slam for the first time.
The players inhabit different worlds on the tennis tour.
When Gauff was starting her US Open title push in August last year, Kartal was picking up just $550 for losing in low-level ITF event in Prague.
Gauff has already banked over $2.6 million this year from prize money.
Kartal arrived at the All England Club with just over $18,500 from her efforts on court but her progress to the last 32 at Wimbledon guarantees her a windfall of more than $182,000.
""I've got a couple of birthdays coming up with the family. I think they're a little bit happy that I won today,"" said the 22-year-old when asked how she intended to spend her money.
Gauff has been in impressive form this week, dropping just six games in two matches.
Monfils plus Dimitrov equals 70
With a combined age of 70, two of the sport's great entertainers meet for a place in the last 16.
Monfils, the 37-year-old dazzling and unorthodox Frenchman, made his All England Club debut in 2005 while Dimitrov made his bow four years later.
Surprisingly for players of such longevity, the two have only met five times, with Monfils holding a 4-1 advantage, including winning the pair's two Grand Slam meetings at the US Open, in 2011 and 2014.
Monfils made the last 16 at Wimbledon in 2018 while Dimitrov, 33, reached the semi-finals 10 years ago, defeating Andy Murray in the last eight before losing to Novak Djokovic.
""I love the competition. I love the sport. I love the game. To be honest, it's a feeling that you can't have anywhere else,"" said Monfils when asked why he keeps playing.

Parliament Buildings
has been left in a state of disarray after a section of protestors opposing the
proposed Finance Bill 2024/25 breached the National Assembly's Grounds on
Tuesday, amidst intensified demonstrations countrywide.
The protestors began
by destroying the premise's perimeter wall and barricade, rushing towards
the National Assembly entrance and gaining access to the House.
In a matter of minutes
the protestors ransacked different parts of Parliament buildings, breaking windows
and doors, destroying furniture and
setting a section of the House ablaze.
Parliament's mess hall
was also not spared with the protestors first indulging in food set aside for
MP's ,who had earlier passed amendments of the contentious bill, before
destroying cutlery and utensils.
The protestors
likewise destroyed Parliament's outdoor sitting section, burning gazebos during
the incident.
Some protestors also managed to steal the National Assembly's mace, a symbolic item
of royal authority without which neither Parliament nor the Senate can enact
legislation.
Police responded by
using live ammunition to disperse the protestors who scattered in different directions
before regrouping and heading towards Parliament again.
Reports indicate that some protestors sustained fatal gunshots during the incident but the
official death toll is still undetermined.

Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has called for the resignation of National Intelligence Service (NIS) Director General Noordin Haji, faulting him for overseeing what he described as a decline in the agency's effectiveness under his stewardship.
Speaking from Mombasa on Wednesday, Gachagua lamented that since Haji succeeded Major General (Rtd) Philip Wachira Kameru in June 2023 the NIS has become dysfunctional, failing to adequately assess public sentiment, particularly concerning the now withdrawn Finance Bill 2024.
""I sympathise with President Ruto because this information was not available to him. NIS is mandated to provide such information and that is where the problem is; we have a dysfunctional NIS that has exposed the President, the government and the people of Kenya,"" said Gachagua.
""Noordin Haji must take responsibility for the deaths that have occurred, the mayhem witnessed and for failing Ruto, the government and Kenya by not doing his job and advising correctly. He must not just take responsibility but resign from that office and allow the president to pick a competent DG""
According to Gachagua, had Haji properly briefed Ruto on the widespread public opposition to the Bill, Ruto would not have forwarded it to Parliament, thus averting the nationwide protests that escalated on Tuesday, culminating in protesters storming Parliament.
""People had to die, property destroyed and protests for the President to know what Kenyans felt, yet there is an organisation funded by Kenyans to brief the president and the public about the sentiments of Kenyans.""
""Officers from the National Police Service (NPS) have told me in confidence that they did not receive advance intelligence briefs about the magnitude of the protests. Never have protesters invaded Parliament.""
Gachagua persisted in his tirade, vehemently criticizing Haji, alleging that he was unfit and lacked the qualifications for the top position in the NIS.
""When he (Haji) was appointed to the office of the Director General, he chased away all the people who were senior to him when he was in the service because of an inferiority complex, crippling NIS and making it dysfunctional,"" he said.
""Three directors were chased away and reassigned to desk jobs across the government. 13 assistant directors, men and women with proven track records of intelligence and analysis, were removed from the NIS leaving a shell under a clueless Director General with no capacity to run the organisation. That is why the security sector was caught off guard by the intensity of the protests. Had Noordin Haji done his job; we would not be where we are today.""

The driver of the minibus was also killed and seven other children were rushed to hospital, according to officials in Johannesburg's Gauteng province.
Television images showed that the minibus was totally destroyed by the fire in the early morning crash in Merafong, more than 70 kilometres (45 miles) west of the city.
Charred schoolbook pages were scattered on the tarmac, as police examined the scene.
""A private scholar transport minibus was involved in a tragic accident in the Kokosi-Wedela area in Merafong, claiming the lives of the 12 learners and their driver,"" the Gauteng government said in a statement.
It could not immediately give the ages of the children but said most were from a primary school, where students are normally aged between six and 13.
""They were burnt beyond recognition. When this happens forensics will have to do their part in terms of identification,"" Gauteng traffic police department spokesman Sello Maremane told AFP.
Police were investigating what happened but it appeared that the minibus was struck from behind by a small pick-up truck, causing it to overturn and catch fire, authorities said.
The driver of the pick-up was also in hospital, reports said. By late afternoon, most of the children in hospital had been released, reports said.
""I am profoundly saddened by this tragic event,"" Gauteng education minister Matome Chiloane said.
South Africa has one of the most developed road networks on the continent but also has one of the worst road safety records, in part due to reckless driving and unroadworthy vehicles.
""I have always said to parents we need to check the condition of the vehicles that we put our kids in,"" Chiloane said at the scene of the crash.
Many South African parents have to rely on private minibuses to get their children to school.
In the worst road accident in South Africa this year, 45 people heading to a religious event were killed in March when their bus plunged off a bridge into a ravine in the north of the country.
The bus was travelling from neighbouring Botswana to Moria, where an Easter pilgrimage and service have attracted more than a million worshippers in recent years.
In February, at least nine supporters of the African National Congress party were killed in a bus crash as they were travelling home after attending an electoral rally in the east of the country.
In May, 13 people died in a head-on collision between a minibus taxi and a truck on a major road in the northern province of Limpopo.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/senior-us-republican-demands-biden-administration-shut-gaza-aid-pier-n344806,"Senior US Republican demands Biden administration shut Gaza aid pier
The Republican lawmaker who leads the House Armed Services Committee has written to the Biden administration formally demanding it shut down its aid pier off the coast Gaza, calling the operation ineffective, risky and a waste of money.
The offshore floating pier, announced by Biden in March as a response to the threat of famine in the Gaza Strip, was constructed off the coast of the enclave by the U.S. military as a way to bring in food and other aid supplies.
The U.S. military has been authorized to operate it until the end of July, but a U.S. Agency for International Development official said this week that the administration could seek to extend it for at least another month.
""I urge the Administration to immediately cease this failed operation before further catastrophe occurs and consider alternative means of land and air-based humanitarian aid delivery,"" House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers wrote in a letter seen by Reuters.
The letter, sent to White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, has not been previously reported.
Rogers has long opposed the pier and has called in the past for it to be dismantled, but he had not previously expressed that view in a formal written letter to the administration.
His armed services committee is the Pentagon's top oversight body in the House of Representatives, and formal requests from its chairman traditionally require a response from Pentagon officials.
Aid first began arriving via the U.S.-built pier on May 17 into Gaza, where nearly all the 2.3 million residents have been displaced by Israel's campaign against the militant group Hamas.
But rough seas have damaged the pier, forcing repairs, and poor weather has limited the number of days the pier has been operational.
Most of the supplies that have reached the shore have yet to be distributed by UN aid agencies which say their operations have been limited by insecurity.
""As of June 19, JLOTS had only been operational about 10 days and had only moved 3,415 metric tons onto the beach in Gaza,"" Rogers wrote, using the U.S. military's acronym for the pier system, known as Joint Logistics Over the Shore.
According to U.S. military data, as of Tuesday, 8,332 pallets had been delivered via the pier. But around 84% of them have been sitting on Gaza's coast in a marshalling area waiting to be picked up by the United Nations for distribution.
The World Food Programme paused deliveries earlier this month over security concerns.
Reuters was given rare access to the U.S. military-run pier off Gaza on Tuesday and saw aid pallets being moved from a vessel onto the 1,200-foot (370 m)-long pier as it bobbed around with the incoming waves. The pallets were then taken by trucks to the coast.
The operation is complex, involving about 1,000 U.S. military personnel. The Pentagon estimates the first 90 days of operation will cost about $230 million.
Rogers also noted that three U.S. servicemembers suffered non-combat injuries while deployed on the operation.
""I urge the Administration to immediately cease this failed operation before further catastrophe occurs and consider alternative means of land and air-based humanitarian aid delivery,"" Rogers wrote.

Colombia came from behind to grab a 1-1 draw with Brazil on Tuesday, ensuring their qualification to the Copa America quarter-finals as group winners.
An equalizer from Daniel Munoz in first half stoppage time was enough to earn Colombia a share of the spoils after Raphinha had fired Brazil into the lead with a sublime 12th-minute free-kick at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California.
The result means Colombia advance to the knockout rounds as winners of Group D, where they will face Group C runners-up Panama in Glendale, Arizona, on Saturday.
But Tuesday's draw means Brazil will face a titanic showdown in Las Vegas on Saturday against arch-rivals Uruguay, winners of Group D with a perfect record.
Brazil goalscorer Raphinha insisted the five-time world champions would be unfazed at the prospect of playing Uruguay.
""Our team is evolving with each game, with each training session and we think we're on the right track,"" Raphinha said.
""Unfortunately it wasn't the result we wanted, and it wasn't the position that we wanted to qualify for the quarter-finals in.
""But whoever wants to be champion shouldn't be worrying about who they play in the next round; we have to be prepared for anyone.
""If we want to win this competition we have to be prepared to play our best.""
Brazil will head into the quarter-finals without Real Madrid star Vinicius Jr, who picked up his second yellow card of the tournament for a reckless early foul on James Rodriguez on Tuesday.
Colombia playmaker Rodriguez had alarm bells ringing amongst Brazil fans from the ensuing free-kick, just clipping the top of the bar with goalkeeper Alisson beaten.
But although Colombia made the smoother start it was Brazil who took the lead after 12 minutes, with Raphinha curling a sensational free-kick into the top corner to make it 1-0.
Colombia however continued to threaten, Rodriguez volleying over the bar on the turn after 16 minutes.
Rodriguez thought he had set up Colombia's equalizer three minutes later, supplying a pinpoint cross from a free-kick on the right for Davinson Sanchez to home.
The goal was ruled out for offside after a VAR review.
Tempers threatened to boil over midway through the first half, and Venezuelan referee Jesus Valenzuela issued three yellow cards in quick succession to Colombia's Deiver Machado and Jefferson Lerma along with Brazil's Joao Gomes.
Colombia looked the more assured side throughout the first half and in stoppage time their slick play got its reward, with Crystal Palace wing back Munoz blasting home after being released by a superb pass from veteran forward Jhon Cordoba.
Colombia -- who have now gone 26 international games unbeaten since a defeat to Argentina in early 2022 -- looked comfortable through the second half and should have wrapped up victory in the final minutes only for substitute Rafael Borre to shoot over from eight yards with the goal gaping.
In Tuesday's other Group D game Costa Rica defeated Paraguay 2-1 in Austin to finish in third place.

Denmark expect midfielder Christian Eriksen to overcome stomach issues and play in the Euro 2024 last 16 clash with Germany in Dortmund on Saturday.
The Danes' bid to spring a massive upset took a hit on the eve of the match with the influential Eriksen, and fellow midfielder Thomas Delaney both skipping team training with stomach problems.
Denmark coach Kasper Hjulmand said on Friday Eriksen ""had some stomach issues this morning, and it's the same thing we had with Thomas Delaney"", with the two kept separate to protect the rest of the team.
The coach said though that Eriksen was ""feeling better again and we expect that he will be able to play tomorrow"".
Eriksen, 32, has had a memorable return to the European Championship three years after he collapsed on the pitch in a match against Finland and was later fitted with an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD).
He was named man-of-the-match in Tuesday's 0-0 draw with Serbia and played his 133rd game in Danish colours, breaking the all-time record.
Former Borussia Dortmund midfielder Delaney is less likely to recover in time, but Hjulmand said ""we have a plan B for every player"".
Denmark finished second in their group, behind England, after drawing each of their three group games, which earned them a meeting with three-time winners Germany, who won two and drew one in the pool stage.
The Danes won the Euros in 1992, defeating Germany in the final in Sweden despite being rank underdogs and the Danes are hoping to spring a similar upset on Saturday.
""Germany are one of the favourites and it's just too bad they're playing us tomorrow,"" Denmark coach Kasper Hjulmand said, while praising ""the quality they have and the way they've expressed themselves in the first few matches.""
""But we also have a great team and so they have to be very, very good tomorrow to beat us"".
Hjulmand responded to rumours Borussia Dortmund striker Niclas Fuellkrug may start in place of Arsenal's Kai Havertz, saying his side were ""ready for everything, no matter who they put on the pitch.""

The Kenya Sevens
Morans head coach Louis Kisia has thrown down the gauntlet to the rest of teams
participating in the 2024 Rugby Africa 7s in Mauritius, setting his eyes on
securing gold in the championships.
Kisia was speaking
during the naming of the official Morans squad where familiar names made a
comeback to the team.
Denis Abukuse, William
Mwanji and Festus Shiasi all who last featured for the National team in the
first leg of the Challenger Series in Dubai made a return to the fold with
Shujaa regular Brian Mutua co-captaining the side together with Ben Salem.
“Our target in
Mauritius is the gold medal. We want to replicate our performance during the
2023 Rugby Africa 7s tournament. The team knows our objective and they’re ready
to conquer Africa for the second year running,” said Louis.
Kisia who doubles up as the Shujaa
assistant coach says the preparations have been top notch ahead of the Africa
tourney.
“We’ve had sufficient
preparations at Kasarani ahead of the Africa 7s this weekend thanks to KRU and
NOCK for ensuring the Morans side trains with the Shujaa squad. We have had HP
sessions led by the Kenya Sevens SnC Coach Andrew Amonde which have contributed
heavily to our preparations for this tournament. We have received input from
the head coach on our preparations and I believe the team is ready to roar in
Mauritius,” said Louis Kisia.
The former Strathmore
Leos tactician had a large pool of talent to pick from, with Joel Inzuga who
lastly turned out for the Simbas making a return to the Morans team alongside
veteran Edmund Anya, Harmony Wamalwa, Elvis Olukuse and Gabriel Ayimba – The
late Benjamin Ayimba’s son making the Morans team for the second time having
played in the Safari sevens earlier in the year.
Kenya Morans, who will jet out Thursday evening, are in Pool A alongside hosts Mauritius, Nigeria and Madagascar.
The only new inclusion in the sevens set up is Victor “Mola” Odhiambo who has been in the Kenya 7s Management radar.
He had earlier been called up to the national team but his
involvement was hampered by an injury but will now have a chance to prove and
endear himself to the Sevens technical bench as he makes the squad for the
Mauritius assignment.
The tournament will be
held over two weekends, 29th/30th June and 6th/7th July 2024.
Kenya will open their campaign on Saturday with a match against hosts Mauritius at 10:50am local time, before taking on Nigeria at 13:34pm and conclude their pool matches by taking on Madagascar at 16:18pm.

National sevens rugby
team co-captain Tony Omondi has expressed satisfaction with the team’s
preparations ahead of the 2024 Paris Olympic Games next month.
Shujaa, as they
are fondly known, have been holed up in camp for the past few weeks and Omondi,
who alongside Vincent Onyala co-captained Shujaa to their return to the HSBC
World Rugby Sevens Series, says the training has been rigorous in a bid to get
in shape before the Olympics.
“So far, the
preparations are going well, we know very well that being in camp you get
enough time to do the things you are required to do, and that’s a big plus for
us. We are training very hard because obviously we are going to meet the best
of the best at the Olympics, and I think you have to prepare like you’re
playing the best of the best and you have to train like you’re the best of the
best, and that is what we are doing currently,” said Omondi.
Omondi, who plays
for Mwamba RFC, says their goal is to finish in the medals bracket at the
Olympics.
“The end goal for
us is at least a medal, and I think as we spoke earlier about qualifying for
the Olympics, that’s done, we spoke about going back to the series, that’s done
and now we are speaking about medaling and I believe that’s possible, averred
Omondi.
Shujaa will be
pumped up by their recent return to the World Rugby Series as they head out to
their final training camp in Miramas, France early next month.
Omondi said, “Most
definitely I believe it goes back to the momentum we have; we have been playing
really well in the past couple of tournaments, and I think when we go to the
ultimate one which is the Olympics, we will make the country proud.”
Kenya are in Pool B alongside Argentina, Samoa and Australia.

In the case, the petitioners argue that there has been ""no lawful or effective public participation on the Finance Bill, 2024 which the National Assembly approved on Tuesday amid violent protests in the country.
The lawyers, Kibe Mungai, Ndegwa Njiru, Fanya Mambo Kinuthia, Peter Koira, Lempaa Suiyianka and Mt.Kenya Jurist Association are also challenging the budget-making process for the coming Financial Year arguing that it was unlawful and characterized by ""controversy, acrimony and political contestation"".
""On account of the willful refusal, neglect and failure by the Finance CS to comply with Article 221(1) of the Constitution, no lawful or effective public participation on the Finance Bill, 2024 has taken place because the Government is effectively asserting powers to raise additional revenue without a budget authorized by the Constitution,"" reads the court documents.
The lawyers note that the Finance CS published the estimates of revenue on 4th June, 2024 after the National Assembly Budget Committee had completed public participation hearing and submitted its report to the National Assembly.
""The budget-making process has been vitiated by the involvement and dictation of the policy preferences and agenda of foreign governments and corporations spearheaded by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which has taken effective control of Kenya's National Treasury to the detriment of the sovereignty of the Kenyan people in matters of public finance,"" they further add.
The petitioners want the Chief Justice to appoint a five-judge bench to hear the matter of national priority.

During Parliamentary proceedings, Minority Leader Opiyo Wandayi called for the government to either release them forthwith or produce them in court according to the Constitution.
“I have been told that there is a unit already established in the police service that reports to nobody. They are a law unto themselves. They are abducting Kenyans,” Minority leader Opiyo Wandayi said in Parliament.
Nairobi Senator Edwin Sifuna also alleged that officers attempted to block him from accessing his office.
“The police officers deployed in Nairobi today are clearly not from here. Ruto has brought his village mates and put them in command of the formations around parliament. I know this because the one in charge of the unit outside the Supreme Court tried to block me from accessing my office at KICC just now. Such cowards!” Sifuna said.
A heavy contingent of security officers was deployed in Nairobi’s Central Business District (CBD) to prevent demonstrators from gaining access to Parliament ahead of the planned protests.
As early as 7:00 am, anti-riot officers were in several streets seeking to quell any protests from erupting. This raised queries about the sudden increase of anti-riot officers across the CBD.
Kenyans online questioned the heavy presence of the officers deployed to battle the peaceful protestors. They wondered why the government did not use the same force to battle external threats.
“These military mobilizations should be against the external enemy, not against unarmed protesters,” Seysaban commented online.
Further, armoured police vehicles were deployed at State House as a means to enhance security during the protests.
Kenyans online responded by urging the Gen Zs to rally up and exercise their rights to protest while at the same time reaffirming that the government is not taking the demonstrations in a light manner.
“Ruto is scared, he knows he has done anything to smile about. We must send him back to Sugoi,”
“Thought he was the man of God. Why is he so afraid now?”
“No one said we were going to the State House. But he is where we want him to be,” read some comments online.

Chege was shot dead outside Kenya's parliament as a crowd of protesters overwhelmed anti-riot police, breaking into the August house as the protests intensified.
His send-off attracted a smattering of Kenyan activists, among them, Haki Africa's Khalid Hussein, Boniface Mwangi and Hanifa Adan.
Chege who was shot in the head was until his demise a celebrated IT professional and a Sunday school teacher at the Jubilee Christian Church.
Politicians were conspicously missing from the funeral in which a mourners decried police brutality, and draped the National flag on their necks.
During the burial activists presented his family with a flag, saying that the late Chege had paid the ultimate price for his patriotism.
Activist Boniface Mwangi implored Kenyans to sustain the fight against bad leadership, urging them to replace the portrait of President Ruto with a photo of the Kenyan flag.
The government maintains that 25 people were killed in protests across the country, disputing the figures by Rights Groups which place the death toll much higher at 43.
According to official figures from the government, some 400 people sustained injuries in the three-week protests.

for development projects and to address their constituents on certain sticky or
national issues.
And on several occasions, political leaders
have used church podiums to attack fellow politicians while others have used
the same podiums to seek to popularise government policies.
But this now appears to have been stopped
by church leaders and even congregants.
In Kiambu. members of the county assembly
who attended a church service at the Kikuyu Church Catholic Parish got a rude
shock when the clergy outrightly denied them an opportunity to speak after the
sermon.
This new turn of events comes in the wake
of an uproar by young Kenyans who say politicians have used places of worship
to display opulence and contempt.
Governor Kimani Wamatangi was the only one permitted
to speak but even he too stayed away from political matters.
At the Kericho AGC Emmanuel church during
the fiftieth anniversary celebrations, elected leaders failed to show up
fearing a backlash from the close to four thousand congregants who attended.
This was a ceremony that three weeks ago
would have attracted several leaders including CSs, Governors, Senators, and MPs
among others.
Instead, only the women rep and three MCAs
attended with only the area MCA and the women rep being allowed to address the
congregation.
Church leaders present say, the actions country-wide
by Gen Z had brought a shift in how matters will be conducted not only nationally
but also in churches.

Novak Djokovic proclaimed himself ""pain free"" after defeating Daniil Medvedev in an exhibition match on Friday ahead of Wimbledon.
Former world number one Djokovic, the seven-time Wimbledon champion, needed surgery earlier this month following a serious knee injury at the French Open.
But on Friday the 37-year-old took his place in the draw for Wimbledon, which starts on Monday, with Djokovic, seeded two, taking on 123rd-ranked Vit Kopriv of the Czech Republic at the grass-court Grand Slam.
Djokovic's movement was not completely smooth in a 6-3, 6-4 win over Medvedev during an exhibition event at London's Hurlingham Club, with the Serbian's right knee strapped up. But he struck the ball crisply and served well.
""I can tell you that I enjoyed myself really, really much today,"" said Djokovic afterwards. ""I can tell you that pain-free tennis is the best tennis. I was pain-free and I'm really glad. It was a great test obviously against one of the best players in the world.
""I've played a couple of practice sets but I really wanted to test myself. The test was very successful so I'm obviously really glad. It's been an intense three week after surgery, spending a lot of hours rehabbing.""
Djokovic, whose tally of 24 singles titles at Grand Slam tournaments is the most won by any man in tennis history, added: ""I kind of always wanted to give myself a chance to be in London. I think my surgeon is here. He's the MVP (most valuable player) for sure the last three weeks.
""I'm trying to take it day by day and see how far it goes.""
Djokovic was forced to pull out ahead of his quarter-final at the French Open against Casper Ruud after tearing the medial meniscus in his right knee.
He has since been looking to learn from fellow tennis players and athletes who have suffered similar injuries, including American Taylor Fritz, who faced a similar situation three years ago and recovered in time for Wimbledon.
""I asked him, I asked many athletes - (Stan) Wawrinka, (skier) Lindsey Vonn, (footballer) Zlatan Ibrahimovic - and they were all very kind to share some of their experiences and give me some contacts of people who could help me out,"" said Djokovic.

https://www.citizen.digital/wananchi-reporting/wananchi-opinion-urgently-address-high-number-of-teen-pregnancies-in-meru-county-n344862,"WANANCHI OPINION: Need to urgently address high number of teen pregnancies in Meru county
It also begs the question, if Meru County had the highest proportion of adolescent pregnancies between the ages of 10-19 years in the country last year, and this number has increased this year to 15,000, what has the County and National government been doing? This issue calls for the urgent intervention of Meru County authorities, the Ministry of Gender, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Child Protection Services, the Judiciary, and the Kenya National
Teenage pregnancy in Meru County is not just a statistic; it represents thousands of young lives disrupted, futures compromised, and dreams shattered. It is also a matter of great concern that signals a persistent cycle of child sexual abuse that is going unaddressed!
These pregnancies often lead to school dropouts, perpetuating the cycle of poverty, increasing cases of gender-based violence, and psychological trauma, and limiting opportunities for these young girls. Moreover, teenage mothers face significant health risks, including complications during childbirth, which can be fatal for both the mother and the child. This situation underscores the need for a multi-faceted approach to tackle the root causes and provide support for affected girls.
Meru County authorities must take the lead in addressing this crisis. Local leadership can initiate community-based programs that focus on education and awareness creation. Comprehensive sex education should be integrated into primary and secondary school curricula to empower young people with knowledge about reproductive health and contraception. An emphasis should be put on creating safe spaces for teenagers to discuss these issues openly to help dispel myths and reduce stigma
The Ministry of Gender plays a crucial role in advocating for the rights and well-being of young girls hence should spearhead campaigns that promote gender equality and challenge harmful cultural practices that contribute to teenage pregnancies in the county. By working closely with community leaders, the ministry can foster an environment where girls are valued and protected.
The Ministry of Health must ensure teenagers can access reproductive health services and information. This includes providing contraceptives, prenatal care, and counseling services. Outreach programs can be effective in reaching remote and underserved areas. Healthcare providers should be trained to offer an accommodative space, and non-judgmental and confidential services to teenagers.
The Ministry of Child Protection Services should work to identify at-risk girls and provide them with the necessary support, including safe housing, counseling, and legal assistance for their justice to be traced effectively. Collaboration with schools and community organizations can help in the early detection of these cases and timely intervention.
The judiciary must play its part by enforcing laws that protect minors from sexual exploitation and abuse. Perpetrators of statutory rape and other related crimes should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. The judiciary should ensure victims receive justice and support throughout the legal process.
The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR) should take an active role in monitoring and reporting on cases of teenage pregnancy and related human rights violations. By highlighting these issues at national and international forums, the KNCHR will put pressure on relevant authorities to take meaningful action. Advocacy and awareness campaigns by the KNCHR can also help in changing societal attitudes and norms that perpetuate teenage pregnancies in the county.
The issue of teenage pregnancy in Meru County and across Kenya is a multifaceted problem that requires a coordinated and comprehensive response. The involvement of these ministries is crucial. By working together, these entities will create an environment where young girls are protected, educated, and empowered to make informed decisions about their futures. Immediate and sustained action is needed to ensure that teenage pregnancy is addressed with the seriousness it deserves, securing a brighter future for our girls.

In an emotional closing remark shortly after the forum, the president took to his X account and highlighted the lessons he learnt during the historic engagement on X Spaces with Kenyans that lasted for about two hours.
President Ruto reaffirmed his commitment to Kenyans that henceforth, his administration would pay a keen ear to the opinions of Kenyans and would be more empathetic to the plight of citizens.
He conceded to the idea that his government had been giving Kenyans deaf ears and had also been slow to implement the promises made during the campaigns, reiterating that going forward; Kenya Kwanza would be more active than passive.
“Listening to the feedback today on X, I think I need to listen more, I need more empathy and my administration needs more empathy and I have heard you say loudly, more action! This is very rich and wealthy feedback. It was a great moment for Kenyans engaging openly, vastly in with no-bounds,” he said.
The President lauded the youth for heeding his request to have the engagement, understating that he had indeed lost touch with such conversations with Kenyans.
He, therefore, committed to consider having similar forums in future in a bid to fulfil the government’s mandate and ensure the people’s needs are met.
“I am immensely grateful for the feedback I got on X. I think that I have taken long before I came to engage you on X Space,” Ruto noted.
“My administration has always believed in engaging and that is why I go around the country engaging people and rarely sit in the office. I look forward to more engagement and working with you going into the future.”
Friday’s conversation saw Kenyans going bare-knuckle at the head of state, reprimanding him over the current state of affairs in the country which resulted in anti-government protests.
Most of the speakers called out the president over the perceived arrogance and opulence top government officials.

Residents of Konoin sub-county in Bomet have been encouraged to venture into hass avocado farming as a way to diversify their agricultural activities and sources of income.
Speaking during the campaign, area MP Brighton Yegon said that the region has been predominantly reliant on tea farming, and there is a need to explore other profitable crops.
""We can no longer solely depend on tea farming for our sustenance. It is time for us to diversify our agricultural activities and take advantage of the booming avocado market,"" he said.
He highlighted the benefits of hass avocado farming, including its high demand in both local and international markets.
A section of residents welcomed the initiative.
""I believe this initiative will benefit our community and improve our standard of living,"" one resident, Jane, said.
The European Union (EU) and China have been cited as some of the international markets for Kenya’s avocados.
Kenya has two seasons for avocados, the main season runs from March to September and the mini-season is from November to January.

The Wiper party’s
National Executive Committee (NEC) now wants Dadaab Member of Parliament Farah Maalim kicked
out of the opposition-affiliated political outfit over inflammatory remarks he recently made against youthful Kenyan protesters
in a video that has now gone viral and elicited anger online.
In
the undated video, Maalim, while speaking in the Somali dialect, said that if
he were the President of Kenya, he would have ""slaughtered 5,000 Gen Z protesters”
during the recent wave of anti-Finance Bill 2024 demonstrations.
The Kalonzo Musyoka-led
party, in a statement to newsrooms on Wednesday, distanced itself from the remarks
made by the MP – who is also the deputy party leader - further calling for his removal from all Parliament committees.
The party’s National
Delegates Convention (NDC) is now set to make a decision on the NEC’s
recommendations
“Regarding the
conduct and statements attributed to Deputy Party Leader Farah Maalim, let it
be known clearly that the Wiper Democratic Movement party distances and
disassociates itself from these remarks,” read the statement.
“They go
against our guiding principles and values as a party. NEC’s decision is that Farah
Maalim be de-whipped from all Committees in Parliament including the Speaker’s
Panel. NEC also recommends expulsion from the Party to the National Delegates
Convention (NDC) – the supreme organ of the party.”
Maalim was also
among other Wiper lawmakers censured for going against the party decision in
the contentious Finance Bill, 2024 vote when it came on the floor of the House.
“On the conduct
of party members, first, we believe strongly in the fidelity of political
parties, their mission, vision and identity. It is in the public domain that three
of our members, namely, Farah Maalim – MP for Dadaab, Doris Donya Toto - Kisii
Women Rep, John Okano Bwire – MP for Taveta and Abubakar Ahmed - Nominated MP,
have repeatedly gone against the party position,” added the statement.
“Their latest
transgression was voting Yes and Abstaining – in the case of Donya - for the
now withdrawn Finance Bill, 2024. The four received invitations to attend
today’s NEC meeting. They all failed to attend nor have offered their
apologies. Their cases have been referred to the Party’s Disciplinary Committee.”
This comes after the National Cohesion and Integration
Commission (NCIC) also summoned the MP to appear before it on Thursday to shed
light on the controversial remarks.

Host nation Germany face Spain in Friday's Euro 2024 quarter final in Stuttgart riding a wave of belief not seen in the proud football nation for almost a decade.
After a series of poor performances at major tournaments, the most decorated nation in European football history are again confident of a deep run.
Germany veteran and 2014 World Cup winner Toni Kroos said Wednesday ""the goal is to win the tournament"".
""We want to go a lot further and in the dressing room we are very convinced we will achieve that.""
The bold stance is a far cry from nine months ago, when Hansi Flick became the first coach sacked in Germany history after a 4-1 demolition by Japan in Wolfsburg.
His replacement Julian Nagelsmann only won one of his first four games in charge, but in March laid the groundwork for a successful Euro run.
Nagelsmann made 11 changes to the squad, bringing in players from eventual Bundesliga champions Bayer Leverkusen and surprise runners-up Stuttgart, while axing several big names.
But Nagelsmann's most crucial step was bringing back Kroos, who had stepped down from international football in 2021.
The midfielder has excelled in what will be his final tournament before retiring from football completely.
Won Games we Would have Lost
The clash between the tournament's two most impressive teams - and the only sides to have won three Euros titles - would be a marquee matchup for the final in Berlin.
But with other pre-tournament favourites like France, England and Portugal stuttering, whoever emerges victorious on Friday will be favoured to go all the way to the German capital.
With four wins in four, Spain are the only side to have tasted victory each of their matches at Euro 2024 and have scored nine goals while conceding just once.
Germany have won three and drawn one but have faced challenges along the way.
A player with an unblemished record of success, six-time Champions League winner Kroos believes the will to win comes ""only through experience"".
""You can have a winning mentality or belief, you can live it, but it's hard to convey it in conversations.
""You have to go through experiences and that's how your belief grows more and more.""
Kroos pointed to the ""difficult situations"" which have honed Germany's tenacity.
""Against Hungary we had difficult moments, against Switzerland we were behind. Versus Denmark things did not go so smoothly,"" Kroos said, explaining ""something like that helps you get through tough phases, stay calm and believe in yourself"".
""We now have a different belief. We are now winning games or at least not losing games that we were clearly losing in the past.""
Eventually they will all understand
Kroos will do battle against Spain, the country he has lived in for the past decade.
He said his knowledge of the Spanish players from his time at Real was no clear advantage, saying ""they're all pretty well known.
""I don't think we're expecting any big surprises.""
The 34-year-old felt underappreciated in Germany, which motivated his decision to leave Bayern Munich for the Spanish capital in 2014.
Bayern powerbroker Uli Hoeness was particularly critical of Kroos, calling him ""sideways pass Toni"" and saying in 2021 ""Toni Kroos has no place in modern football anymore"".
Hoeness, the man who built Bayern into a global powerhouse, clearly understands football, which made the criticism even more bizarre.
Asked on Wednesday if the Spanish were quicker to see his value faster than the Germans, the midfielder said cooly ""I'll say it like this, some of them understand quickly, and some others need a bit more time.""
""But eventually, they all understand.""

Kenya Adaptive Para Boxing Federation president Mary Atieno said they were well received by their hosts and are ready to punch medals for Kenya.
The team was flagged off by the Sports CS Ababu Namwamba on Wednesday, and Atieno has backed the two para bocers led by coach Elijah Mringie, to shine in the Polish capital following proper preparations that they had back home.
“The team arrived safely in Poland and all the boxers are in good shape. The tournament starts tomorrow and Evans will be the first to grace the ring. I am very confident that he and Yakhama will win their bouts,” said Atieno.
Heavyweight boxer Odhiambo will fight with a homeboy Nikodem Prządka, who also represents his country in the discus throwing.
Team captain and lightweight pugilist Yakhama, who is also East African and African champion together with Odhiambo, will take on Pawel Kaleta.
He believes they have what it takes to deliver medals.
However, Atieno has encouraged the boxers who missed the chance to go to Poland to represent the country, not to lose hope.
""For those players who missed traveling with this team, I ask them not to lose hope and they should continue to train while maintaining a high level of discipline. There are many competitions still to come and you never know that tomorrow you might get your chance to represent the country.
“I also appeal to other differently abled people who are at home in our 47 counties and are able to play this game, don't hide or be afraid, come out and participate.""

In Bondo town, hundreds of youths took to the streets on Tuesday to demand for a total rejection of the Finance Bill 2024.
They crisscrossed the streets, carrying twigs, placards and the effigy of Bondo MP Gideon Ochanda, whom they accused of betraying them.
They rebuked the MP, who voted in favour of the bill during the second reading last week, arguing that he failed to represent their interests, adding that the Finance Bill has proposed punitive taxes.
Julian Ochieng’, a university student leader, said, ""Contrary to what some MPs have been saying, claiming that we don't understand the Finance Bill, we understand it. We have brains and are not stupid. We reject the Bill.""
""We are not going to tire, nor will we allow ourselves to be intimidated.""
Jack Mawere, a resident, said, ""We condemn what is being done in Parliament. We do not accept the draconian Finance Bill. The President needs to listen to the voice of the people.""
Last week, a section of youths marched to the MP's office, demanding answers as to why he voted in favour of the bill against their wishes.
They carried along with them a coffin written #Reject Finance Bill 2024, which they placed outside the door of the MP's office.
The controversial Finance Bill 2024 was passed through Parliament during the Committee of the Whole House sitting on Tuesday.
The majority of MPs voted to adopt a report of the Whole House where the lawmakers approved the amendments to the Bill.
A total of 195 MPs voted in support of the Bill, while 106 voted to reject it. There were three spoilt votes.

In a media release on Sunday, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) revealed the reason for Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter's dramatic daylight 'abduction,' describing it as an arrest for a criminal offense.
The DCI stated that Keter was arrested for ""conspiracy to traffic firearms and incitement to violence.""
""Contrary to the misinformation circulating on social media on alleged abduction of Hon Alfred Keter by unknown men, this is to confirm that Hon Keter was arrested earlier today by NPS Officers for Conspiracy to Traffic Firearms and Incitement to Violence,"" the Directorate said.
DCI refuted claims on social media that Keter was arrested, stating that he was arrested by police and booked at Kamukunji Police Station.
""He was booked at Kamukunji Police Station and later released pending Forensic Analysis of exhibits. Thereafter the file will be forwarded to the ODPP for direction.""
DCI warned the public not to speculate on Keter's alleged abduction.
""Police are urging members of the public to refrain from acts of violence, hate speech and malice for sustained peace and security in our beloved country,"" DCI further said.
This comes after Keter was forced out of his car in Kileleshwa on Sunday, while his wife and children looked on in horror.
Faith Odhiambo, President of the Law Society of Kenya, later revealed that Keter had been taken to the Kamukunji Police Station.

Kenya has won the inaugural East Africa Regional Development
Tournament (EAREDT) in Amateur Wrestling last weekend in Nairobi by clinching
Kenya scooped 121 points after excelling in both the Freestyle
and Beach Wrestling categories that had both the Juniors from under 15, 17, 20 categories
and seniors in both men and women to win the first ever East Africa Amateur Wrestling
Championships.
It was staged on home soil, something that national team coach
and Technical Director Linus Masheti says has set the standards high in the region.
“Most of our medals came in the seniors while our juniors who we
call cadets have registered mixed results. It shows that we are somewhere in
between good and average,” noted Masheti.
“Our main intention now and focus will go to the school-going
children as we aim for the 2026 Youth Olympics in Dakar, Senegal,” said Masheti
on Sunday after the conclusion of Beach Wrestling at Strathmore University in
Nairobi.
Surprise package Burundi came in second with 16 points, as
neighbors Tanzania finished the podium spots with nine points in third place.
Uganda and Mauritius both had four points and were ranked fourth
and fifth respectively, as Sudan closed the ranking chapter with a point.
Kenya had 45 points in Beach Wrestling, Burundi amassed nine
points, Tanzania three points and Mauritius two.
“This competition has tested our endurance and tactical approach
for the game. We need more of such competitions either home or abroad because
they prepare us for international events like the Olympics which I have missed
and also by so doing, we are going to raise the standards of Wrestling in East
Africa, "" said Beach Wrestling gold medalist Mathayo Mahabila, who also
won a bronze medal during the 2023 Africa Beach Wrestling Games in Tunisia.
Kenya Amateur Wrestling Association (KAWA) President Anthony
Kariuki and Secretary General Erick Walucho both agreed that following the
successful regional Championships, the local association in conjunction with
the World Amateur Wrestling governing body will organize more events across
Kenya in a bid to develop the sport.
“This is the way to go and we have to thank United World
Wrestling for funding this program here in Kenya. We hope that this will be a
regular thing, doing it at least thrice a year as we target the 2028 Summer
Olympic Games in Los Angeles,” said Kariuki.
Development Director at United World Wrestling (UWW) Deqa
Diamkey was quick to emphasize that KAWA has pledged to support Kenya for the
next coming three years to host the East Africa Wrestling Championships, a
project that also includes coaching courses, referees training, youth
tournaments and camps aimed at promoting Amateur Wrestling in Kenya and the East
African region.
As the first ever East Africa region armature Wrestling Championships
came to a close in Nairobi, 150 athletes from six countries have proved their
worth on the floor mat and the sand in a bid to secure the region's top
honorary titles in both men and women, but all eyes will now be on Kenya with
the UWW funding that is aimed at developing wrestling talents in the country
and across the East Africa region.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/ruto-pulls-out-of-global-peace-leadership-meeting-n344691,"Ruto pulls out of Global Peace Leadership meeting
President William Ruto will not attend the Global
Peace Leadership Conference scheduled this week in Nairobi, its organisers said
on Wednesday.
The summit was slated from Tuesday, June
25, through Thursday, June 27, to bring delegates worldwide to “explore and
discuss ways to promote peace, development, and cooperation”, per its
promotional materials.
President Ruto was set to give a keynote
address on Wednesday.
However, organisers announced in the morning that
the opening ceremony had been cancelled as a result of “the events over the
last two days in Kenya, the loss of lives, and the casualties of the protests
at the Parliament on June 25.”
They said Ruto was no longer attending the
conference.
“We mourn those who have died, pray for a
full recovery for those who were injured, and hope for healing for this nation
so that it can find a way forward towards a future that benefits all its people,”
read a statement shared online.
The Global Peace Leadership Conference is organised
by the Global Peace Foundation, the Inter-Religious Council of Kenya, the
Chandaria Foundation and the Kenyan government.
Its objectives are billed on its website as
promoting an “African Renaissance that draws on Africa’s unique heritage and
the strength of its spirituality and traditional values”, empowering African
leadership, strengthening intracontinental partnerships, and cultivating“ ethical
global citizenship.”
It is co-chaired by former Zanzibar President
Amani Karume, the Global Peace Foundation’s International President James Flynn,
Kenyan industrialist Manu Chandaria and Willybard Lagho, chair of the Interreligious
Council of Kenya.
Tuesday saw day-long nationwide demonstrations
led by the youth to protest President Ruto’s government’s unpopular Finance
Bill 2024, which seeks to introduce more taxes.
But the demonstrations culminated in violent
scenes as crowds broke through police lines and breached Parliament buildings
in Nairobi after legislators passed the bill, which now awaits presidential
assent to become law.
The ceremonial mace, which symbolizes the
authority of the legislature, was stolen, some parts of the parliament building
vandalised and a section of it set on fire.
Police fired live ammunition at the mob,
killing at least five people and injuring over 30 others, according to Amnesty
International.
Over 125 people were injured in the day’s
events, the human rights organisation HAKI Africa said.
President William Ruto in a late evening address
denounced the day’s events as treasonous and accused “organised criminals” of hijacking
a “critical conversation” on the Finance Bill to cause havoc.
He vowed to crack down on the “planners,
financiers, orchestrators and abetters of violence and anarchy” and deployed
the military to back the police force’s security enforcement.
The United Nations Secretary-General
Antonio Guterres on Wednesday urged Kenyan authorities to restrain from violence
and pave the way for peaceful demonstrations.
Moussa Faki, the African Union Commission
chairperson, urged stakeholders to exercise calm and welcome constructive
dialogue.

The welcome sight of the masked Kylian Mbappe back on the pitch could not disguise another under-par performance from France at Euro 2024 which raises questions about their chances of winning the competition.
The French are through to the last 16 after emerging unbeaten from the first round, but Tuesday's 1-1 draw with Poland in Dortmund meant they finished second in Group D behind Austria.
Ironically, Austria are the only team the 2022 World Cup runners-up have managed to beat so far at the competition, as they followed their 1-0 victory over Ralf Rangnick's men with a 0-0 draw against the Netherlands and then an insufficient display in being held by the group's bottom side.
There are consequences for that, as Les Bleus now find themselves in what looks to be the wrong half of a lop-sided draw in the knockout rounds.
Next up is a tie on Monday in Duesseldorf, scene of Mbappe's nose break against Austria.
That match will be against the runners-up in a tight Group E, whose identity will be determined later on Wednesday and could be any one of Belgium, Romania, Slovakia or Ukraine.
However, the path to the final looks especially murky after that, with the possibility of a quarter-final against Portugal and then a last-four tie against Spain or Germany.
France have been the best European team at the last two World Cups, winning the trophy in 2018 and losing on penalties to Argentina in the final 18 months ago.
They do not look like the best side on the continent right now, which is a problem for a nation hoping to win the European Championship for the third time, and first since 2000.
Mbappe returned against Poland after missing the Netherlands match due to his broken nose. Playing with a protective face mask, he converted a second-half penalty for his first ever goal at a Euros.
- Where have goals gone? -
It was his 13th goal for France at a major tournament, putting him level with Just Fontaine who scored all of his at the 1958 World Cup, and behind only the 14 of Michel Platini.
But Mbappe's goal was not enough to beat Poland as Robert Lewandowski replied with a spot-kick of his own.
France scored 16 goals in seven matches at the last World Cup, then netted 29 in eight qualifiers for the Euros, albeit 17 of those came against Gibraltar.
However, they have failed to score a single goal themselves in open play so far at this tournament, beating Austria thanks to an own goal and drawing a blank against the Dutch before Mbappe's penalty against Poland.
Coach Didier Deschamps nevertheless pointed out that his team were often thwarted against Poland by goalkeeper Lukasz Skorupski, who was named man of the match.
""I have full confidence in our attackers,"" insisted midfielder Eduardo Camavinga. ""We need them, and they have always shown up in the past.""
Above all, France can go forward into the knockout rounds in the knowledge that their defence looks secure, with Lewandowski's penalty the only goal they have conceded so far.
""The team spirit is there, so is the solidity, and we are creating chances,"" said Deschamps, and only Germany have had more attempts on goal than the French.
""Maybe other teams have shown greater potential, and the fact we are not scoring goals has limited us.
""Some groups might not have been too difficult, but our group really was. Now we can have a little break which will do us good, and then we move on to the last 16.
""The impressions left after the first round are not always the same later on. Our objective was to qualify. We have done that, and now it is only big teams who are left.""
For France to keep going from here, though, Deschamps will notably need to get Antoine Griezmann back playing at his best –- the forward with 132 caps was dropped against Poland, which is a rarity.
And he will especially be hoping that his team starts scoring, as captain Mbappe gets used to his mask and attempts to lead the team through the knockout rounds.

President William Ruto on Friday
hosted Kenyan Catholic bishops at State House, Nairobi, for what he said was a
conversation to come up with solutions to the country’s problems.
The delegation of the clergy,
President Ruto said in a post on X, was led by the Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops (KCCB) Chairman Archbishop Maurice
Muhatia.
“We welcome the commitment by the Catholic Church to participate in a multi-sectoral engagement that seeks solutions to the issues facing our country. Through this collective approach, we will move Kenya forward,” he wrote.
This comes amid clamour from Kenyans online to delink
politics and religion, with a prominent social media activist now launching a
campaign to rid churches of politicians in a move dubbed ‘#CleanTheAltar.’
Mwabili Mwagodi, a hotel expert
based in Mombasa, has kicked off the campaign which has seen him directly text
or call church pastors and bishops and personally urge them to disinvite Kenyan
politicians - including the President - from their functions.
As Ruto was addressing the
faithful at the ACK Nyahururu Diocese Church in Nyahururu, Laikipia County, the
venue of a consecration ceremony and enthronement of Rev. Maj. Samson Mburu
Gachathi as the 3rd Bishop of ACK Nyahururu Diocese, Mwambili led youthful
protesters in chanting anti-Finance Bill 2024 slogans outside the venue after
being denied access to the church service.
Now, the hotelier-turned-activist
has shifted his focus to online activism, gathering contacts belonging to
various church leaders and directly warning them of entertaining politicians on
their altars.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/kalonzo-kioni-miguna-behind-ruto-must-go-slogannot-gen-zs-cs-duale-n345173,"Kalonzo, Kioni, Miguna behind 'Ruto Must Go' slogan...not Gen Zs - CS Duale
CS Duale, who spoke on Citizen TV’s JKLive show on Wednesday, opined that the slogan was a creation of opposition leaders and politicians against President William Ruto’s leadership.
He went on to name Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka, Jubilee Party Secretary General Jeremiah Kioni, and outspoken lawyer Miguna Miguna as being among the creators of the anti-Ruto slogan that has also caused a wave across social media platforms.
“Ruto must go slogan is not a Gen Z slogan… it is Kalonzo Musyoka, it is Kioni, it is Miguna. It is a traditional cabal group of people who are not Gen Zs, who have not recovered and who cannot wait for 2027,” he said.
“Those are words that are coming from those who should occupy their places in the opposition, traditional people who never voted for Ruto and we respect their views but Ruto is the President today.”
Duale argued that the said individuals are hell-bent on pushing for the removal of the President, with the hope of succeeding him immaturely before his term ends, since they are aware that they cannot floor him in legitimate presidential elections come 2027.
He claimed that the said leaders are banking on the chance that Azimio la Umoja One Kenya chief Raila Odinga will assume the African Union Commission Chairperson position thereby leaving a vacancy for them in opposition.
“They even feel that since Baba is going to AU, they don’t have a chance in 2027 and in their wildest dreams, they feel there is a shortcut to change William Ruto. The Constitution 2010 does not envisage that, you cannot even tell an MCA that he must go,” Duale stated.
Though the CS did not reveal the names of influential politicians and NGOs that he said are behind the violence witnessed during the protests, he at the same time divulged that the government was compiling a list on the same and will make it public within 10 to 14 days.
“One of the media houses said that the internal security system in our country has already profiled individuals; certain politicians, businessmen and NGOs. In 10 days or two weeks, they will be arraigned in court. We will not allow the deaths that took place to reoccur,” Duale noted.
Since the demonstrations started about two weeks ago, the youths in the streets had been chanting slogans of 'Reject Finance Bill 2024', and 'Occupy Parliament' before later changing to 'Ruto must go!'

https://www.citizen.digital/tech/google-kills-infinite-scrolling-in-search-results-n344767,"Google kills infinite scrolling in search results
Google is ditching continuous scrolling in
its search results page, returning to the classic page design.
The search engine introduced infinite
scrolling for mobile search in October 2021 and on the desktop in
December 2022.
Now, Google is reverting to the good old
pagination format on desktop browsers starting this week.
The feature will be rolled out for mobile browsers
in the coming months, Search Engine Land reports, quoting a Google
spokesperson.
As of Thursday, desktop browsers already featured a pagination bar which allows users to navigate between numbered pages of search results or use the “Next” and “Back” buttons.
The feature was not yet available for
mobile browsing.
The Google spokesperson was quoted as
saying that a “More results” button will be shown at the bottom of a mobile search
page to load the next page.
Google says the U-turn is to allow its
search engine to serve the search results faster on more searches, “instead of
automatically loading results that users haven’t explicitly requested”.
The tech giant says continuous scrolling did
not translate to ""significantly higher"" user satisfaction.
Google has dominated the world’s search
engine market since its launch in 1997, with a 91.6 per cent market share as of October last year.
The rest is shared among other small
players like Bing, Yandex and Yahoo.
In Kenya, the search engine accounted for over
98 per cent of all search traffic in 2023, according to Statcounter.
But while Google is essentially powered by an artificial
intelligence (AI) algorithm, the rise of AI chatbots like ChatGPT is seen as a
threat to search engines because of the imprecise results and numerous adverts the
latter offer.
There have been rumours that OpenAI, the American
Microsoft-backed AI company which owns ChatGPT, is developing a feature for the
chatbot that searches the web and cites sources in its results.
Bloomberg reported in May that the feature
would “allow users to ask ChatGPT a question and receive answers that use
details from the web with citations to sources such as Wikipedia entries and
blog posts.”
“One version of the product also uses
images alongside written responses to questions, when they’re relevant. If a
user asked ChatGPT how to change a doorknob, for instance, the results might
include a diagram to illustrate the task,” the publication added.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/a-mother-shields-her-baby-amid-chaos-at-bombed-kyiv-hospital-n345485,"A mother shields her baby amid chaos at bombed Kyiv hospital
Her voice quivering, the 33-year-old spoke as she emerged from a bomb shelter after one of the worst Russian missile strikes on Kyiv in months. Monday's rare daytime attack all but destroyed sections of Ukraine's largest children's hospital.
""It was scary. I couldn't breathe,"" Kravchenko told Reuters, as rescue workers and soldiers searched for survivors in the huge pile of rubble and ruined buildings.
""I was trying to cover him. I was trying to cover him with this cloth so that he could breathe.""
The Okhmatdyt hospital is renowned across Ukraine and beyond for its child care facilities, and carries out some 10,000 surgical procedures each year. Around 600 children are treated at the institution at any one time.
Ukraine's SBU security service said two people had been confirmed killed and 16 wounded at the site, and that a war crime investigation had been launched.
However, rescuers feared that more people could be missing as they continued to pick through the rubble nearly eight hours after the strike.
Across the country, at least 29 people died in a wave of missile strikes, making it one of the deadliest days of the war this year. Russia says it does not target civilians but thousands, possibly tens of thousands, have been killed since the full-scale invasion began in February 2022.
A missile struck the hospital not far from central Kyiv at around 10 a.m. (0700 GMT). A large part of the two-storey centre housing the toxicology ward was flattened, while windows were blown out in the main 11-floor building nearby.
An elderly female doctor, her head bandaged and white coat stained in blood, wandered through the hospital's grounds in a daze. Glass crunched under her feet.
Trembling mothers clutched infants tight, while older children, some of them unaccompanied, sat where they could, reeling from the shock of the explosion and ensuing carnage.
Dozens of rescuers, soldiers and ordinary people formed human chains to clear the rubble brick by brick.
VOLUNTEERS FLOCK TO SCENE
Holding her baby son, Kravchenko stood outside with her husband Volodymyr, staring at the destruction.
Their car had been parked next to the destroyed building and was now buried under debris, but the young family considered themselves lucky: they had survived with only scrapes and cuts.
""If we had been in the car, our family would not exist any more,"" Volodymyr said, stroking his wife's cheek to comfort her as she wiped tears from her face.
Footage verified by Reuters showed a missile flying in a steep trajectory towards the hospital grounds at high speed, in what appeared to be a direct hit.
Ukraine said the ordnance used in the attack was a Kh-101, a cruise missile which typically carries a 450 kg explosive warhead.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Russia had fired more than 40 missiles at a number of cities, damaging infrastructure, commercial and residential buildings.
Moscow's defence ministry said it had carried out strikes on defence industry targets and aviation bases.
At the hospital, hundreds of local residents flocked to the scene after the attack and offered water and assistance.
One woman stood crying outside the main gates, worried about a relative who had been inside.
Hours after the strike, two more air raid alarms sounded, forcing hundreds of dazed patients, rescuers and onlookers to cram into a highway underpass which was sweltering in the summer heat. It proved to be false alarm on this occasion.
At the Kyiv hospital, 55-year-old doctor Yevheniia Rokhvarg, who worked in the destroyed toxicology department, said that all her immediate colleagues were alive.
But she was unsure about the fate of those who may have remained on the upper floors.
Asked whether she felt anger, she said she did not.
""Maybe exhaustion. And a very deep sadness,"" he said. ""I just wish that this hadn't happened.""

https://www.citizen.digital/news/israeli-officials-consider-hamas-response-to-cease-fire-proposal-n345243,"Israeli officials consider Hamas response to cease-fire proposal
Hezbollah said it fired more than 200 rockets at Israeli bases in an attack that also employed the used of “explosive drones.”
The Iranian-backed group said it was acting in response to Israel’s killing of one of its commanders Wednesday.
The Hezbollah attack prompted air raid sirens across northern Israel. The Israeli military said it intercepted many of the projectiles and carried out fresh airstrikes against launch positions in Lebanon.
The violence came as Israeli officials considered a Hamas response to the latest version of a cease-fire proposal that would include the release of hostages held in Gaza.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Wednesday that Israel was studying “some ideas” that Hamas sent to Qatari mediators.
""The mediators of the hostage deal have given the negotiating team Hamas' response to the hostage deal outline. Israel is examining the response and will respond to the mediators,"" Netanyahu’s office said in a statement.
The mediators, Qatar, Egypt and the United States, have worked for months to reach a deal that would free the hostages and cease hostilities. The ideas that Hamas delivered Wednesday involve the three-phase deal U.S. President Joe Biden put on the table in late May.
The United Nations has expressed concern over Israel’s latest evacuation order for large parts of Khan Younis and Rafah governorates, encompassing about a third of the Gaza Strip and affecting up to 250,000 civilians.
""What we saw in the last two days, since Monday afternoon when the evacuation order was issued, we have seen a constant flow of people moving out,"" said Andrea De Domenico, the head of the U.N. office for humanitarian affairs in the Palestinian territories.
He told reporters in a video briefing Wednesday from Jerusalem that U.N. aid agencies and their partners are having to reset their operations following Israel’s evacuation order.
""Delivering for us is a daily struggle — literally,"" he said.
Israel has repeatedly told Palestinians to leave certain parts of Gaza, usually ahead of military offensives, in a move Israel says is meant to protect civilians from the war.
The evacuations, along with the fighting, have meant people have had to flee multiple times in search of safety.
De Domenico said the U.N. estimates that 9 out of every 10 Palestinians in Gaza have been displaced at least once, and some up to 10 times, since the war started between Israel and Hamas in October.
He said most people on the move this week have headed toward the coastal area, where Israel has established a so-called safe zone. De Domenico said the area is overcrowded and overwhelmed, with little clean water, few toilets and limited basic services.
""Nowhere and no one is safe in Gaza,"" De Domenico said. ""We keep on saying this. We have seen over and over military operations and bombardment happening also in the heart of the humanitarian safe zone declared by Israel.""
Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza erupted when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, mostly civilians, according to Israeli authorities.
Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed nearly 38,000 people, according to the health ministry in Gaza, and left the densely built-up coastal enclave in ruins.

Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja has given his
endorsement to activist Boniface Mwangi's proposal to organise a memorial concert
at Uhuru Park this Sunday to commemorate Kenyans who tragically lost their lives during the
recent wave of anti-government demonstrations.
Speaking in Nairobi on Thursday, Sakaja
welcomed the initiative, underscoring that the concert serves a noble purpose
considering the events that prompted it.
""It is true that I have received a
request for a peace concert to be done at Uhuru Park; I see no problem in it.
If it is a genuine expression, then it is good,"" said Sakaja.
""Uhuru Park belongs to Kenyans and
Nairobians; it doesn't belong to me. I am just a steward over that resource. I
know it is currently an active crime scene but I hope the DCI will
conclude.""
The Nairobi Governor went ahead to add that even
he himself would attend the concert.
""We will support that expression; that
concert is in honour of young people who we lost. It is good to honour them and
their families and see what support we can give them. Personally, I will attend
because these are my constituents,"" he said.
Sakaja's remarks comes hours after Mwangi, in
a statement on X, stated that he had tried to reach the
Nairobi Governor in regards to the peace concert to no avail.
Mwangi added that his phone calls to both the
Governor and Shaffie Weru, who runs the events docket in Nairobi County, went
unanswered.
Later, however, Mwangi revealed that Weru had
reached out to him and asked him to make his request in writing, with the
activist adding that this would be a concert akin to the one he helped organise
for the Garissa massacre victims in 2015.
""Our insurance provider is assessing the
damage at City Hall. We have insured all our properties. They (goons) also
burnt down our 40-foot mobile recording studio at Uhuru Park costing in
excess of Ksh.60 million. It was also insured so there is no additional cost on
us as a county or taxpayers. Fortunately the fire didn't damage a lot of
records because we have digitised our processes,"" he said.
""Damage to businesses is difficult to
quantify because they also have their arrangements but we would love to support.""
The Nairobi Governor likewise issued a stern
warning to the hired goons who torched City Hall and their supposed financiers.
""It is very fortunate that we have CCTV
footage from City Hall of those who burnt it down. I have seen frivolous
accusations, but those who were caught on camera, one of them works in an MP’s
office in Nairobi. They will have to answer. The MP or politician who sent them
will have to answer for that damage to public property,"" he said.

In a statement to newsrooms, Uhuru while mourning the loss of Kenyans killed during the protests, underscored the importance of elected leaders listening to their constituents.
“At this trying time, I want to remind all leaders that they were elected by the people. Listening to the people is not a choice but a mandate enshrined in principles of our constitution and in the very basis of philosophy and democracy,” he said.
“Leaders must know that power and authority they have is donated to them by the people. I therefore call for calm and for the leadership to show restraint and do the right thing by listening to the people.”
According to Uhuru, the government should not use force and be antagonistic towards Kenyans exercising their constitutional rights to peaceful protests.
“Violence on either side is not the answer. As your former President, I have felt the weight and difficulty of leading Kenya I therefore pray for wisdom and civility to be established and for peace and progress to belong to all of us as children of Kenya,” he said.
Uhuru likewise urged the ruling government to embrace dialogue with Kenyans.
“I pray for understanding on the part of each and every Kenyan and for all of us to remember that Kenya is bigger than one of us; there is nothing cast in stone that cannot be changed,” said Uhuru.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/we-are-deeply-concerned-imf-says-on-kenyas-situation-amid-protests-n344783,"'We are deeply concerned': IMF says on Kenya's situation amid protests
In a statement issued on Wednesday, Julie Kozack, IMF Director of Communications, stated that the financial body was concerned with the tragic events including the loss of lives and destruction of property.
Kozack noted that the IMF was taking a keen look at the country's situation while reaffirming its position in assisting Kenya to overcome its economic challenges.
""We are deeply concerned about the tragic events in Kenya in recent days and saddened by the loss of lives and the many injuries. Our thoughts are with all the people affected by the turmoil in the country,"" the statement read in part.
""The IMF is closely monitoring the situation in Kenya. Our main goal in supporting Kenya is to help it overcome the difficult economic challenges it faces and improve its economic prospects and the well-being of its people. We are committed to working together with Kenya to chart a course towards robust, sustainable, and inclusive growth.""
Kenyans have decried the austerity measures imposed by the IMF as conditions that the government needs to meet before securing loans.
Some of these measures include scrapping fuel subsidies as well as increasing Value Added Tax (VAT) for fuel from 8 per cent to 16 per cent.
Since February 2021, IMF has disbursed over Ksh.341 billion to Kenya under the Extended Fund Facility arrangement.
The EFF program provides financial aid to countries to settle the huge balance of payments that arose from structural problems. IMF sets a longer repayment plan to allow the country to adjust and implement the structural reforms.
Several politicians have advised the government against ceding to such measures, pointing out that the country's economy is adversely affected as the cost of living soars high leading to a lower purchasing power among Kenyans.

As
the rescheduled Vihiga County Secondary Schools Sports Association games are
set to begin this Wednesday, Hobunaka Boys’ football head coach Kelvin John
aims to lead his team to the regionals this year.
Hobunaka
Boys' football team, which has not advanced past the county stage in the last
two years, is making its third appearance this year. Coach Kelvin John revealed
that he has addressed some of the challenges that have hindered the
Luanda-based school from succeeding in secondary football games.
""Our
striking force has been blunt. That’s why we exited last year’s finals at the
group stage despite holding the Emusire Boys’ team to a 1-1 draw. Our five
points left us third in the group that produced Vihiga’s finalists (Emusire and
Vihiga Boys’), but it wasn’t enough because our strikers failed to convert many
chances we created,"" said Kelvin John.
""We
have trained adequately to sharpen our strikers, and I know they have also
matured,"" stated the Hobunaka soccer team tactician, who has led the team
to the County finals thrice. His major objective for the finals, which will be
held in Luanda and Emuhaya starting this Wednesday, is to represent Vihiga
County in the Western regionals for the first time.
However,
this may not be an easy task for Hobunaka, who must beat the Emusire Boys’ team
in their opening match at Es’saba secondary school field. If Hobunaka advances
past the group stage, they will face tough encounters against two-time County
winners Ebwali FC and Vihiga Boys’ teams, who emerged as champions in 2019,
2022, and 2023 respectively.
The
competitions in various ball game categories will run for three days, from
Wednesday to Friday. Chavakali Boys' 3x3 basketball team will be defending
their title alongside Tigoi Basketball 3x3 girls team, Vihiga Boys in Rugby 7s,
Ibubi Girls, and Vihiga Boys soccer teams. Mudavadi Girls will be defending
their netball title, while Mudavadi and Vihiga high school volleyball teams
will be out to guard their championship glory from last year.
Hobunaka
soccer team is pooled in Group B at Es’saba secondary school field together
with Emusire, Bugina, Shamakhokho, and Chango secondary schools. On the other
hand, KSSSA 2019 champions Ebwali FC are in Group A with Vihiga, Senende,
Ebusiloli, and Chavakali secondary schools.
On
the girls' side, Group A soccer contenders include Tigoi, Kilingili, Mudavadi,
Lusenegeli, and Es’song’olo at Esiandumba secondary playground. Group B at
Ebusakami playground will include Vokoli, Ibubi, Madira, Kapsotik, and
Ebusiratsi’s St. Bakhitas.

Kevin De Bruyne refused to comment on the angry reaction of Belgium fans after Wednesday's 0-0 draw with Ukraine at Euro 2024, insisting that ""we need them"" ahead of a last-16 match with France.
Belgium missed the chance to finish top of Group E after having to settle for a point in Stuttgart, with De Bruyne seemingly instructing his team-mates not to head over to applaud the supporters after the game.
The Manchester City playmaker was making his way towards the Belgium fans behind the goal before appearing to change his mind as the whistling and booing intensified.
""We need these fans, we need them against France,"" said De Bruyne.
""We just need them. I don't know what else to say.
""We gave it our all during the three matches, everybody wanted to win the matches. We tried to do this but we didn't manage to do so,"" he added.
Knowing a point was enough to send them through, albeit as runners-up behind Romania, Belgium adopted a safety-first approach in the closing minutes, fearful of a Ukraine goal that would have knocked them out.
""I think until the 90th minute we tried to find solutions... afterwards I think Ukraine had a good chance, maybe two,"" said De Bruyne.
""When it's one minute from the end of the match you can't take a risk. I understand people want us to win, but if I take the corner and they go down the other end and score people are going to kill me.""

""Joe Biden is a patriot but is no longer the best candidate to defeat Trump,"" Ryan, who flipped a Republican-held New York district in 2019, said in a social media post. ""For the good of our country, I am asking Joe Biden to step aside - to deliver on his promise to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders.""
WHY IT'S IMPORTANT
Biden has faced doubts about his reelection chances after a weak and faltering performance in a debate against Republican former President Donald Trump late last month.
Since then, some Democratic members of Congress and high- profile donors have publicly asked him to step aside as the party's candidate for the Nov. 5 election. Biden has said he will stay in the race.
KEY QUOTES
""Key White House staff must come before our committee so we can provide the transparency and accountability that Americans deserve,"" Republican U.S. Representative James Comer, the panel's chair, said. Comer called Biden ""unfit"" for office and alleged his staff were not being transparent.
""According to one former Biden aide, these three employees – Annie Tomasini, Anthony Bernal, and Ashley Williams – have created 'a protective bubble around' President Biden,"" the panel added.
White House spokesperson Ian Sams said the subpoenas were ""a baseless political stunt"" and that Comer was ""weaponizing subpoenas to get headlines instead of seeking information through the proper constitutional process.""
REPRESENTATIVE MIKIE SHERRILL
""Because I know President Biden cares deeply about the future of our country, I am asking that he declare that he won’t run for reelection and will help lead us through a process toward a new nominee,"" Sherrill, of New Jersey, said in a statement.
REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SMITH
""President Biden should end his candidacy for a second term as President and release his delegates to the Democratic National Convention to enable the party to nominate a new candidate for President,"" Smith said in a statement. ""The President’s performance in the debate was alarming to watch and the American people have made it clear they no longer see him as a credible candidate to serve four more years as President. Since the debate the President has not seriously addressed these concerns. This is unacceptable. The stakes are simply too high.""
REPRESENTATIVE LLOYD DOGGETT
Doggett, a House member from a safe Democratic district in Texas, was the first congressional Democrat to call for Biden to step down.
""President Biden has continued to run substantially behind Democratic senators in key states and in most polls has trailed Donald Trump,"" Doggett said in a statement. ""I had hoped that the debate would provide some momentum to change that. It did not.""
REPRESENTATIVE RAUL GRIJALVA
Grijalva, a liberal who represents a district in southern Arizona along the border with Mexico, told the New York Times it was time for Biden to end his campaign, saying, ""If he's the candidate, I'm going to support him, but I think that this is an opportunity to look elsewhere."" Grijalva representatives did not respond to requests for comment.
CONTEXT
Many lawmakers from Biden's own party have expressed worries that Biden has not done enough in the ensuing days to convince voters that the debate was an aberration, rather than a true reflection of his abilities. Biden has argued that he is best-positioned to defeat Trump.
Comer previously tried to interview the three aides during a probe into Biden's handling of classified documents in which Special Counsel Robert Hur did not press charges against the president, the panel said, adding the White House did not make the three aides available at the time.
WHAT'S NEXT
The Republican-led panel has asked the aides to respond by July 17 and requested they sit for closed-door interviews later in July.

https://www.citizen.digital/entertainment/allan-kiuna-the-preacher-the-force-and-the-dad-of-kenyas-prosperity-gospel-n345583,"Allan Kiuna: The Preacher, the Force and the 'Dad' of Kenya's Prosperity Gospel
An unabashed champion of the Prosperity Gospel, a sub-culture of church teachings which extols material success in the believers of Christ, Bishop Allan Kiuna was a man of a gilded mission - a servant of Christ who did not shy away from the finer things in life, hoping to heap his opulent abundance onto his followers.
Kiuna was a suave, spiritual charmer who started small alongside his equally elegant wife before ballooning into a wondrous religious behemoth who conquered the city and amassed a staggering fortune.
Sporting his signature curly hairstyle and a smile which could charm an Arabian princess, Kiuna was the poster boy for all things glorious - he could carve words into everlasting spiritual gems and arouse congregations with the sheer might of his gospel rhetoric.
A clever megachurch genius, with astute marketing techniques, Kiuna oozed power and grace, easily winning converts with his gestural sermonising of the prosperity doctrine’s seductive allure.
Always on hand to compliment his adroitness was his wife Reverend Kathy Kiuna, a rockstar in her own right, and an indomitable figure in the seemingly indestructible Kiuna super-brand.
The visionaries, who founded the Jubilee Christian Church (JCC) in January 1999, went on to preside over an enormous entity patronised by celebrities, heavy hitters, city hotshots and even politicians.
At the helm, Kiuna called the shots, transforming what was once a small-time gathering of faithful into a renowned doctrinal brand.
Sunday services at JCC were a concert-style symposium characterised by triumphal choruses, syncopated clapping, blaring drums, performative chants and drawn-out worship marathons.
Like a rock star at the Madison Square Garden, Kiuna would then take over the sessions, sweating profusely, handkerchief in hand and armed with carefully curated anecdotal quotes for the charged gathering hanging onto his every word.
Not too far from the pulpit was his wife Kathy who could be seen egging her man on - her face, clammy and flushed as she fawned over her partner who was rocking the stage and lighting up the crowd with unmatched ease.
Like born-again Bonnie and Clyde, Kathy and Allan never hid their unwavering dedication to each other, ready to go to war for the Lord - and for their minted family brand.
To their followers, they were simply 'Mum and Dad', a term used so liberally, so endearingly on them, it brought some form of unease and even embarrassment in some quarters.
Always in pricey three-piece suits, and those sharp Ferragamo loafers, Kiuna was the embodiment of success, the bastion of godly elegance, as he stood next to Kathy, who beamed brightly and shimmered in her sequined dresses and bouncy wigs.
Like Kenneth Copeland and Jesse Duplantis before him, Kiuna knew the way to the world's heart was through television - and flowery sermons. On that front, he performed spectacularly and with stupendous results.
Drenched in the anointing, Kiuna knew just what words to use to rouse the crowd - he knew how to weave the scriptures into spiritual euphoria, pounding an unwavering message of indescribable earthly success to all those who trusted in the Lord.
It was easy to sell the narrative - because, he, was testimony.
The churchy lovebirds went on to conquer more than just the hearts of believers - they quickly ascended the financial ladders, becoming one of the wealthiest - and most prominent - couples in Kenya.
And even when, sometimes, questions were raised about their conduct, or their messaging and some of their not-so-savoury activities, the Kiunas knew not to ruffle feathers and dive into controversies - they were a masterclass on public relations, a thoroughbred duo on image management.
However, they were also flagrant self-promoters who used their privilege, wealth and position in society to anchor themselves favourably and carve a shatterproof image of the perfect couple who had weathered storms, fought and argued but still came out smelling like roses.
Even when he was diagnosed with cancer back in 2018, Kathy Kiuna took it all in her stride, updating the world on her husband's progress, telling it all and taking it all graciously and with Christ-like agility.
As the cancer took its toll, Allan Kiuna vanished from the main stage, retreating to hospitals and his bed, as his wife carried on the torch, using his infirmity as yet another opportunity for the Lord to manifest Himself and deliver a victory for His people.
“Chemotherapy had him at his lowest. What was most difficult for me, was having to be home preaching most of the time and not by his side physically and honestly speaking it took all of me to even stand and preach,” she said back in 2019.
“Regardless of how I felt, I had to show my husband that we would get through this and show strength even when it was hard and would later go on my knees and remind God of His promises most times with tears rolling down my face.""
Fast forward to 2024, the JCC partriach is no more and his family - biological and spiritual - are certainly feeling the weight of the insurmountable loss.
But in the final book of Christian movements in Kenya, Kiuna will be remembered as a phenomenal force who rose from the backstreets to become an invincible pulpit giant who commanded millions and lived as fabulously as a Brazilian soccer star.

Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann has started Emre Can in defensive midfield alongside Toni Kroos, ahead of Robert Andrich, for Friday's Euro 2024 quarter-final clash with Spain in Stuttgart.
Andrich has been a fixture of Nagelsmann's starting side since March and has played from the beginning in each of the hosts' four matches so far at Euro 2024.
Can, who was left out of Nagelsmann's original Euros squad but was called in at the 11th hour to replace the sick Aleksandar Pavlovic, will start his first match for the national team since September.
Nagelsmann also brought back centre-back Jonathan Tah in place of Nico Schlotterbeck - Tah missed Germany's 2-0 win over Denmark in Dortmund in the last 16 with a yellow card suspension.
Spain coach Luis de la Fuente opted to stick with his starting XI from the 4-1 defeat of Georgia in their last 16 tie and the 1-0 win over Italy in the group stages.
Spanish media had reported that RB Leipzig forward Dani Olmo may come in ahead of Barcelona's Pedri for the tie, but De la Fuente decided to stick with his tried and tested formula.
Both Germany and Spain have won three Euros titles, the equal most of any team.
Starting line-ups in the Euro 2024 last 16 fixture between Spain and Germany in Stuttgart on Friday (kick-off 1600 GMT):
Unai Simon; Dani Carvajal, Robin Le Normand, Aymeric Laporte, Marc Cucurella; Rodri, Fabian Ruiz; Lamine Yamal, Pedri, Nico Williams; Alvaro Morata (capt)

Keter was in the company of his wife and children when their car, a Land Cruiser V8, which was blocked by a Ford Ranger double-cabin along Nyeri Road in the shocking incident.
The former MP was then forcefully pulled out of his car as members of the public watched on, with some screaming as Keter resisted the abduction.
He was bundled into the pickup which then drove off, leaving his wife and kids utterly shocked.
His abduction comes a day after he attended the burial of Comedian Fred Omondi in Siaya, where he applauded Kenyan youth for taking to the streets to protest the unpopular Finance Bill 2024.
Keter urged the youth to continue agitating for their rights, joining a host of other people who have rejected the punitive bill.
The former MP has been a huge critic of the current government and its policies, siding with the opposition and indeed protesters who are now calling for President Ruto to resign from office.
Keter's abduction is the latest in a chain of others that have targeted proponents of the huge protests that took place in most parts of the country.
Social media influencers who have called and fuelled the protests have been targeted lately, despite President Ruto calling for the release of all those who were abducted.
The nationwide protests saw Ruto reject the entire bill, but labelled protesters who stormed Parliament as criminals. Ruto has vowed to deal with them.

The approval made on Wednesday during a special sitting has however elicited controversy on its legal basis and the manner in which it was conducted.
Rarieda MP Otiende Amollo took to social media to state that the sitting occurred without media coverage as is the norm in past proceedings.
It is also unclear if the members had a proper quorum in line with the Constitution which requires 50 members in the National Assembly.
Amollo alleged that in 30 minutes, Parliament unanimously authorised the deployment of the military before breaking for recess.
The Constitution dictates that the government must seek the approval of the National Assembly before military deployment.
""And, Without Media, Without Most Members, Without Proper Debate, In A Record 30Mins, National Assembly Has Just Made Kenya A Military State; Authorizing Deployment Of KDF Without Indicating Where, Why Or For What Period, & Did So Retrospectively Contrary to Article 241(3)(c). God Bless Us,"" Amollo stated on his X platform.
Further, critics have raised concerns about how MPs can convene without a mace which symblises the authority and dignity of the House. The mace was seized during the protests in Parliament precincts on Tuesday. In the absence of a mace, no formal business can be transacted.
Questions also arise on why the deployment was first gazetted before approved by Parliament.
MPs are now set to break for recess on Wednesday and resume regular sittings on Tuesday, July 23.
On Tuesday, the legislators adopted the Finance Bill 2024 with amendments. They also passed the Appropriations Bill 2024 which sailed through the Committee of the Whole House stage.
Following the protests, photos were shared online on Wednesday morning of KDF officers deployed to protect government infrastructures.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/effective-approaches-to-trading-gold-in-global-markets-n344681,"Effective approaches to trading gold in global markets
The Global Appeal of Gold
Gold is universally valued for its stability and intrinsic value. Its price movements are influenced by various factors, including geopolitical events, economic data, and market sentiment. For Kenyan traders, staying abreast of these global trends is crucial for making informed trading decisions.
Key Factors Influencing Gold Prices
1. Economic Indicators: Inflation rates, employment data, and GDP growth can impact gold prices.
2. Geopolitical Events: Wars, elections, and diplomatic tensions often lead to increased gold prices as investors seek safe-haven assets.
3. Currency Fluctuations: The value of the Kenyan Shilling against the US Dollar can affect gold trading profitability.
4. Market Sentiment: Traders' perceptions and speculative activities can lead to significant price movements.
Effective Gold Trading Strategies
Technical Analysis
Technical analysis involves examining past market data, primarily price and volume, to forecast future price movements. Advanced traders in Kenya can leverage various technical indicators and chart patterns to identify profitable trading opportunities.
1. Moving Averages: Utilize Simple Moving Averages (SMA) and Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) to identify trends and potential entry points.
2. Relative Strength Index (RSI): Use RSI to determine overbought or oversold conditions, helping to time entry and exit points.
3. Fibonacci Retracement: Apply Fibonacci levels to identify potential support and resistance levels in the gold market.
Fundamental Analysis
Fundamental analysis focuses on evaluating the intrinsic value of gold by considering economic data, financial statements, and other qualitative and quantitative factors.
1. Economic Reports: Regularly monitor reports from central banks, especially the Federal Reserve, as their policies significantly impact gold prices.
2. Geopolitical News: Stay informed about global events and political developments that can affect market sentiment towards gold.
3. Supply and Demand: Analyze the production rates of major gold-producing countries and the demand from sectors like jewelry and technology.
Risk Management Techniques
Diversification
Diversifying investments across different asset classes can reduce risk. Kenyan traders should consider allocating a portion of their portfolio to gold while investing in other commodities, stocks, or bonds.
Position Sizing
Position sizing involves determining the appropriate amount of capital to allocate to a single trade. This helps manage risk by ensuring that no single trade can significantly impact the overall portfolio.
1. Fixed Fractional Method: Allocate a fixed percentage of the trading capital to each trade, such as 2-5%.
2. Volatility-Based Method: Adjust position sizes based on market volatility, investing more in stable markets and less in volatile ones.
Stop-Loss Orders
Implementing stop-loss orders can protect against significant losses by automatically closing a position when it reaches a predetermined price level.
1. Fixed Stop-Loss: Set a fixed price level below the entry point to limit potential losses.
2. Trailing Stop-Loss: Adjust the stop-loss level as the price moves in the trader's favor, locking in profits while minimizing risk.
Leveraging Technology in Gold Trading
Trading Platforms
Advanced trading platforms offer a range of tools and features that can enhance gold trading strategies.
1. MetaTrader 4/5: Widely used by forex traders, these platforms provide comprehensive charting tools, automated trading capabilities, and real-time market data.
2. Proprietary Platforms: Some brokers offer their own trading platforms with unique features tailored to gold trading.
Algorithmic Trading
Algorithmic trading involves using computer algorithms to execute trades based on predefined criteria. This can help Kenyan traders capitalize on market opportunities with speed and precision.
1. Automated Strategies: Develop and test automated trading strategies to execute trades without manual intervention.
2. Backtesting: Test strategies against historical data to evaluate their effectiveness before deploying them in live markets.
Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis involves gauging the overall mood of the market participants towards gold. By analyzing news, social media, and other sources of market sentiment, Kenyan traders can gain insights into potential price movements.
1. News Feeds: Subscribe to financial news platforms to stay updated on global economic developments and their impact on gold prices.
2. Social Media Trends: Monitor social media channels and forums where traders discuss market trends and sentiment.
3. Market Surveys: Participate in or review market sentiment surveys conducted by financial institutions and analysts.
Implementing Sentiment Analysis
Incorporate sentiment analysis into your trading strategy by combining it with technical and fundamental analysis to make well-rounded trading decisions.
1. Sentiment Indicators: Use sentiment indicators like the Commitments of Traders (COT) report to understand the positioning of large traders in the gold market.
2. Contrarian Approach: Consider taking positions opposite to the prevailing market sentiment when it reaches extreme levels, as markets often reverse when sentiment is overwhelmingly one-sided.
Adapting to Market Conditions
Economic announcements, such as interest rate decisions and employment reports, can lead to significant volatility in gold prices. Advanced traders in Kenya should develop strategies to capitalize on these market-moving events.
1. Economic Calendar: Keep an economic calendar to track important upcoming announcements.
2. Event-Driven Trading: Develop strategies to trade around these announcements, such as entering positions before the event and closing them shortly after to capture quick price movements.
Seasonal Trends
Gold prices often exhibit seasonal patterns due to factors like increased demand during festivals and holidays. Understanding these trends can help traders in Kenya time their trades more effectively.
1. Historical Data Analysis: Analyze historical price data to identify recurring seasonal patterns in gold prices.
2. Strategic Positioning: Adjust trading strategies to align with these seasonal trends, such as increasing positions during periods of historically high demand.
Advanced Risk Management Techniques
Hedging Strategies
Hedging involves taking positions in the market to offset potential losses from other investments. Kenyan traders can use hedging techniques to protect their gold trading positions.
1. Options Contracts: Utilize options contracts to hedge against adverse price movements in gold.
2. Futures Contracts: Use futures contracts to lock in prices and mitigate the risk of unfavorable market changes.
Leverage Management
Leverage can amplify both gains and losses. It is crucial for advanced traders to manage leverage effectively to avoid significant losses.
1. Controlled Leverage: Use lower leverage ratios to manage risk and prevent large drawdowns.
2. Regular Monitoring: Continuously monitor leveraged positions to ensure they remain within acceptable risk parameters.
Educational Resources and Continuous Learning
Online Courses and Webinars
Engage in continuous learning through online courses and webinars focused on gold trading strategies and market analysis.
1. Trading Academies: Enroll in reputable trading academies that offer specialized courses on gold trading.
2. Webinars: Attend webinars hosted by experienced traders and market analysts to gain insights into advanced trading techniques.
Books and Publications
Reading books and publications by renowned traders and financial experts can provide valuable knowledge and enhance trading skills.
1. Recommended Reading: Read books like ""The New Case for Gold"" by James Rickards and ""Gold Trading Boot Camp"" by Gregory T. Weldon for in-depth understanding and strategies.
2. Financial Journals: Subscribe to financial journals and magazines that cover the latest trends and developments in the gold market.
Conclusion
Trading gold in global markets requires a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics, effective trading strategies, and robust risk management techniques. For advanced forex traders in Kenya, leveraging these approaches can lead to significant trading success. By combining technical and fundamental analysis with sentiment analysis, adapting to market conditions, and continuously enhancing their knowledge, traders can navigate the complexities of the gold market and achieve their investment goals.

In her place, the head of state appointed Jeremiah Ndambuki Simu to chair the board for three years.
According to a Gazette Notice, President Ruto noted that the decision took effect on Friday, July 5.
""In exercise of the powers conferred by section 16 (3) (a) of the Affordable Housing Act, as read together with section 51 (1) of the Interpretation and General Provisions Act, I, William Ruto, President of the Republic of Kenya and Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Forces, appoint Jeremiah Ndambuki Simu to be the Chairperson of the Affordable Housing Board, for a period of three (3) years, with effect from the 5th July, 2024. The appointment of Linda Nkatha Gichuyia (Dr.) is revoked,"" the notice read in part.
The decision to revoke Gichuyia's role as Affordable Housing Board chair comes barely three months after her appointment.
Ndambuki's role will be to oversee the development of affordable housing programs across the country. Further, he shall coordinate the utilisation of the housing levy in implementing the program.
Additionally, Ruto appointed Emmanuel Kombe Nzai as the Kenya Vision 2030 Delivery Board chairperson for three years.
The Affordable Housing program has been a cornerstone in President Ruto's legacy projects, as he emphasised his commitment to realising its success.
In a past interview, Ruto noted that the major role of launching the program was to tackle the issue of unemployment in Kenya, which currently stands at 12.7 per cent according to the Federation of Kenya Employers (FKE).

https://www.citizen.digital/news/new-south-african-government-inspires-hope-and-fear-n345014,"New South African government inspires hope and fear
President Cyril Ramaphosa appointed former main opposition leader John Steenhuisen to head an important ministry on Sunday, bringing the Democratic Alliance and other parties into a coalition cabinet for the first time in three decades.
The ruling African National Congress was forced to join rival parties to stay in power after losing its majority in a May 29 poll, getting just 40% of the vote, the first time it has received under half of votes in a national election.
The compromise struck left the DA with six ministries, including agriculture, a major part of South Africa's economy, which went to Steenhuisen, public works, environment and basic education. It also got six deputy minister posts, including finance, trade and energy.
""The sheer weight and spread of these twelve portfolios amount to a recognition that the DA has a meaningful and vital role to play in the reconstruction of our country,"" Steenhuisen said in a speech.
PARTY INTERESTS
For some, especially business owners, bringing a centre-right, overtly capitalist party into the fold was a welcome step forward.
""Business is looking forward to working with the new administration,"" Busisiwe Mavuso, CEO of Business Leadership South Africa, said in a newsletter. ""They will find a willing partner in business, which will enthusiastically back reform.""
Yet she also warned ""they cannot afford to squander the optimism,"" pointing out that turning around an economy that has been in the doldrums for 10 years was a mammoth task.
Jee-A van der Linde at Oxford Economics called Ramaphosa's cabinet a ""business-friendly outcome"" but said it remained to be seen whether it could solve South Africa's economic woes.
For parties representing the interests of workers, the mood was even more guarded.
""Merit does not appear to have been the overarching motivation for all the (cabinet) appointments,"" Federation of Unions of South Africa (FEDUSA) said in a statement, adding they ""seem to favour political party interests (rather) ... than addressing the urgent requirements of the South African nation.""
Some businesses seemed to share this fear, with the South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry warning key goals ""will not be achievable if there is no meritocracy"", while political analyst Daniel Silke decried a lack of ""outside experts in key portfolios not beholden to ... political interests"".
Others were also critical of the size of the cabinet, increased to cater for all the coalition parties.
""South Africa had a comparatively large cabinet already, and even the DA has previously called for significant reductions,"" Markus Korhonen, senior associate in Strategic Intelligence at S-RM, said.
""The expansion of deputy minister posts to no fewer than 43 will do little to quell this criticism,"" he added.

Residents of the Shejaia neighbourhood in Gaza City said they were taken by surprise by the sound of tanks approaching and firing in the early afternoon, with drones also attacking after overnight bombing of the city, which Israel had combed early in the war.
""It sounded as if the war is restarting, a series of bombings that destroyed several houses in our area and shook the buildings,"" Mohammad Jamal, 25, a resident of Gaza City, told Reuters via a chat app.
Later on Thursday, the Palestinian Civil Emergency Service said the Israeli military strikes had killed at least seven people in Shejaia so far.
More casualties are feared to be under the rubble where rescue teams cannot reach, it said.
Footage obtained by Reuters showed women, men and children carrying bags and food as they ran in the streets after the raid began. Some men carried injured children, some bleeding, in their arms as they fled.
""This is the (Israeli) occupation targeting us, as you can see. You can see the children, the targeting of children here,"" said a man carrying a bleeding boy in his arms.
An Israeli military spokesperson said they had no comment on reports of casualties in Shejaia.
The armed wing of Hamas ally Islamic Jihad said it had detonated a pre-planted explosive device against an Israeli tank east of the district.
Israel accuses the militants of hiding among civilians and says it warns displaced people to get out of the way of its operations against the fighters.
""For your safety, you must evacuate immediately south on Salah al-Din Street to the humanitarian zone,"" army spokesperson Avichay Adraee posted on X in a call to residents and displaced people in Shejaia.
Residents and Hamas media said the tanks had moved in before the post and that people from the eastern suburb were running westward under fire as Israel had blocked the road south.
More than eight months into Israel's war on Gaza triggered by the Hamas-led cross border attack on Oct. 7, aid officials say the enclave remains at high risk of famine, with almost half a million people facing ""catastrophic"" food insecurity.
""We are being starved in Gaza City, and are being hunted by tanks and planes with no hope that this war is ever ending,"" Jamal said.
ANOTHER CHILD DIES OF MALNUTRITION
The death of another girl in Kamal Adwan Hospital late on Wednesday raised the number of children who have died of malnutrition and dehydration to at least 31, a Gaza health official said, adding that the war made recording such cases difficult.
Israel denies accusations it has created the famine conditions, blaming aid agencies for distribution problems and accusing Hamas of diverting aid, allegations the militants deny.
In southern Gaza, drone footage on social media, which Reuters could not immediately authenticate, showed dozens of houses destroyed in parts of Rafah, with the Swedeya village on the western side of the city completely wiped out.
There was no immediate Israeli military comment on the military action.
International mediation backed by the U.S. has failed to yield a ceasefire agreement although talks are continuing amid intense Western pressure for Gaza to receive more aid.
Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said on Wednesday that he had discussed his proposals for governance of post-war Gaza that would include local Palestinians, regional partners and the U.S. but that it would be ""a long and complex process"".
Senior U.S. officials told Gallant, who was visiting Washington, that the U.S. would maintain a pause on a shipment of heavy munitions for Israel while the issue is under review.
The shipment was paused in early May over concerns the weapons could cause more Palestinian deaths in Gaza.
Hamas says any deal must bring an end to the war and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, while Israel says it will accept only temporary pauses in fighting until Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007, is eradicated.
When Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, they killed around 1,200 people and seized more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.
The Israeli offensive in retaliation has so far killed 37,765 people, the Gaza health ministry said on Thursday, and has left the tiny, heavily built-up Gaza Strip in ruins.
The Gaza health ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants, but officials say most of those killed have been civilians. Israel has lost 314 soldiers in Gaza and says at least a third of the Palestinian dead are fighters.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/atwoli-urges-ruto-to-suspend-assenting-finance-bill-2024-into-law-n344706,"Atwoli urges Ruto to suspend assenting Finance Bill 2024 into law
Addressing the press on Wednesday, Atwoli stated that the chaos witnessed on Tuesday cannot be blamed on the Kenyan youth, famously classed as GenZ, arguing that the protests were infiltrated by goons who made the demonstrations violent.
""They had genuine concerns and even the President promised to engage them but come yesterday's demonstration, according to us, it was inflated by goons,"" said Atwoli.
""Those people who represented GenZ and Millenium young men who were looting, burning offices, that was not the intention of our young men. They had already said theirs was peaceful and anything to do with burning of properties was not in their calendar of demonstrations.""
With heightening tensions on the passing of the Bill into law, Atwoli urged President Ruto to halt the process and instead form a commission of inquiry to help iron out the contentious matters.
He added that allowing violence to escalate in the nation would strip off the gains made on democracy.
""I want to appeal to the President and his government... the Bill collects for the budget to spend and without a Finance Bill I know it will be very difficult for the government to operate but for now on behalf of Kenyan workers who cannot even access their places of work during demonstrations, we are appealing for the President to suspend assenting to the Finance Bill and appoint a commission of inquiry to inquire into the demands of GenZ and other Kenyans,"" said Atwoli.
He urged Ruto to allow room for dialogue between him and the Kenyan youth, proposing that the committee should be formed immediately to achieve an amicable decision.
""These young people have a myriad of things they are asking for. It's not only a question of the Finance Bill,"" he said.
The protests on Tuesday led to police-inflicted killings of many young Kenyans as many were shot dead while attempting to access Parliament.
A section of the legislature was set ablaze as some of the protesters breached Parliament and vandalised its alleys and other areas.
President Ruto said that he would not allow ""criminals posing as peaceful protesters"" who attacked critical national buildings to get away with it.
""We must isolate crime from democratic expression and separate criminals from people exercising their freedom of expression and divergent opinion,"" he added.
Officers from the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) were deployed to reinforce the Kenya Police and a special sitting has been convened to approve the request by the Defence Council to deploy their officers.
According to Article 241 of the Constitution, the deployment of KDF cannot be enacted before Parliament's approval.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/haiti-prime-minister-vows-transparency-to-population-traumatized-by-gangs-n345112,"Haiti Prime Minister vows 'transparency' to population traumatized by gangs
Despite what he called an ""extremely complicated"" situation in the gang-plagued Caribbean nation, the leader of Haiti's transitional government pledged on Tuesday to offer ""transparency"" to his countrymen as he takes on the challenge of restoring order.
Conille -- who has had an extensive career within the United Nations, including a stint as UNICEF's regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean -- sat down for an interview with AFP during a visit to Washington.
He also met with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to discuss the deployment in June of the first members of a Kenyan-led international force tasked with helping the overwhelmed Haitian police in their battle against powerful armed gangs.
The 58-year-old Conille said his transitional government inherited an ""excessively difficult situation.""
Gangs control 80 percent of the capital Port-au-Prince and nearly 600,000 people are displaced, he said.
""Infrastructure practically is non-existent, ministries no longer even have offices, staff are very unmotivated and the police need help,"" he told AFP.
But Conille also sees glimmers of hope -- he hailed the spirit of cooperation that allowed for the formation of a transitional council after controversial prime minister Ariel Henry stepped down.
Despite difficult negotiations, a government was named, with an eye toward offering Haitians some relief from the political, security and humanitarian crises wracking the country, and organizing the first elections since 2016.
- 'Haitian responsibility' -
Conille said the second contingent of the Kenyan-led force should arrive in the ""coming weeks,"" but offered no further details, citing security reasons.
Security is sorely needed in Haiti, where conditions sharply worsened at the end of February, when armed groups launched coordinated attacks in Port-au-Prince, saying they wanted to overthrow Henry.
But Conille sought to reassure his people, who are scarred by the bitter memories of past foreign interventions, that the current deployment will simply support Haiti's national police.
""The responsibility for reestablishing security is first and foremost a Haitian responsibility,"" said Conille, who last served as prime minister in 2011-2012.
The international force ""will not replace police. It's really an immediate solution that will give us the time to reinforce the capabilities of our own police and army, so these two institutions can more effectively carry out their functions,"" he said.
Haitian authorities will be fully in charge, and work alongside the international policing mission, he emphasized.
""We have put in place a police-army task force that is thinking about concrete strategies to allow us to move forward on the security issue,"" Conille added.
- Trust -
Much of Port-au-Prince is now in the hands of gangs accused of abuses including murder, rape, looting and kidnappings. Hospitals and clinics have been attacked and looted of supplies. Food insecurity has soared.
Conille said he understood that Haitians were ""impatient"" and wanted to see progress on the ground as quickly as possible.
But he insisted that time was needed to put the necessary structures in place so that the country could move forward, while protecting police officers and regaining territory lost to gangs ""in the not so distant future.""
He said he hoped the gang scourge could be resolved ""definitively.""
""In this kind of situation, transparency is our best ally,"" Conille said, explaining that Haitians had long ago lost faith in national institutions and were looking carefully to the transitional government to improve their living conditions.
""We will communicate regularly. We're going to tell them very clearly what we are doing. We're going to share with them as well when things don't work out,"" Conille said.
As for a path to elections, which are meant to take place before February 7, 2026, the prime minister said organizing polls would be ""the very definition of a successful transition.""
The government ""is working now"" on nominating members of a provisional electoral council, Conille said.
""We are already in the process of putting in place a system and the tools needed to be able to move forward quickly.""

https://www.citizen.digital/news/defiant-biden-throws-down-gauntlet-to-democrats-n345470,"Defiant Biden throws down gauntlet to Democrats
Published on: July 09, 2024 07:04 (EAT)

President Joe Biden insisted again Monday he would not quit the US election race, as the White House denied he had Parkinson's disease following a disastrous debate performance.
The 81-year-old dared Democratic critics to either challenge him at next month's party convention in Chicago or back him against Donald Trump in November's vote.
The president lashed out in both a letter to Congress and a rare call to a television program, at the start of a critical week that includes a NATO summit in Washington where he will face fresh scrutiny.
""I am firmly committed to staying in the race,"" Biden wrote in the letter.
""It is time to come together, move forward as a unified party and defeat Donald Trump,"" he said. ""It's time for it to end.""
The embattled president followed up by phoning into MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" television program to say he was ""getting so frustrated by the elites"" in the party.
""Any of these guys that don't think I should run -- run against me. Announce for president, challenge me at the convention,"" he added.
Trump has been uncharacteristically quiet since the debate but he did speak out Monday on Fox News to say he thinks Biden will resist the pressure and stay in the race.
""He's got an ego and he doesn't want to quit,"" Trump said in an interview with Sean Hannity.
But even as he doubled down, the pressure mounted on the oldest president in US history.
Congressman Adam Smith, the senior Democrat on the US House Armed Services Committee, became the sixth Democratic lawmaker to publicly say Biden should step aside.
""I think it's become clear he's not the best person to carry the Democratic message,"" he told CNN.
Other senior Democrats voiced support for Biden, however.
""I made clear that day after the debate publicly that I support President Joe Biden and the Democratic ticket. My position has not changed,"" House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries told CNN.
Biden's blitz was a clear attempt to lay to rest the spiralling concerns over his health following the June 27 debate against Republican Trump, whom he trails in the polls.
During the debate, Biden repeatedly lost his train of thought, stared blankly and spoke at times incoherently and with a raspy voice. Biden has blamed jetlag and a cold.
The White House has also felt the pressure, with tense exchanges at a press briefing on Monday.
Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre called for ""respect"" while journalists challenged her refusal to confirm reports that a Parkinson's specialist visited the White House eight times.
The visits by Kevin Cannard, a neurologist from the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center where Biden receives his medicals, were recorded in publicly available visitor logs.
""Has the President been treated for Parkinson's? No. Is he being treated for Parkinson's? No, he's not. Is he taking medication for Parkinson's? No,"" Jean-Pierre said.
On Monday night the White House went so far as to release a letter from Biden’s personal doctor, Kevin O’Connor, insisting that the president had not seen a neurologist outside his three annual medicals.
The White House also denied reports that NATO allies attending this week's 75th-anniversary summit in Washington had shown concerns about Biden.
""We're not picking up any signs of that from our allies at all,"" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters.
But NATO leaders have been seeking reassurance in any case amid polls forecasting a November victory for Trump.
The former president has long criticized the defense alliance, voiced admiration for Russian strongman Vladimir Putin, and insisted he could bring about a quick end to the war in Ukraine.
The NATO summit begins on Tuesday, the same day that Democrats, returning to Capitol Hill from a brief recess, hold a caucus meeting where Biden's fate will be discussed.
The Democrat lags behind Trump in most polls even though his rival was recently convicted of a felony in a porn star hush money case.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/joe-bidens-son-hunter-sues-fox-news-for-airing-revenge-porn-n345021,"Joe Biden's son Hunter sues Fox News for airing 'revenge porn'
""The Trial of Hunter Biden"" was made up of six episodes published in 2022 on Fox Nation, the conservative broadcaster's online platform owned by the family of media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
A dramatized version of a criminal trial, the series contained a warning the proceedings were fiction, depicting the first son being prosecuted for graft -- accusations that have been made for years by Donald Trump supporters who point to Hunter Biden's past business ties with Ukraine and China.
The accusations have never led to legal action.
But the series integrates real images of Biden, ""depicting him in the nude, depicting an unclothed or exposed intimate part of him, as well as engaged in sex acts,"" the complaint alleges.
""Fox published and disseminated these intimate images to its vast audience of millions as part of an entertainment program in order to humiliate, harass, annoy and alarm Mr. Biden and to tarnish his reputation.""
The images originated from a laptop that Hunter Biden dropped off at a computer repair shop, but which he never collected.
Its contents have been circulating ever since, and are the subject of widespread conspiracy theories as well as embarrassing fodder for the political opposition.
""This entirely politically motivated lawsuit is devoid of merit,"" Fox News said in a statement.
""Mr. Biden did not complain about (it) until sending a letter in late April 2024. The program was removed within days of the letter, in an abundance of caution.
""Consistent with the First Amendment, Fox News has accurately covered the newsworthy events of Mr. Biden's own making, and we look forward to vindicating our rights in court.""
Hunter Biden was convicted by a jury in June of illegal possession of a firearm in a federal trial that again brought to light his years of addiction to alcohol, cocaine and crack cocaine, apparent in many of the images discovered on the laptop.
In September he will face a separate tax fraud case, a trial that is likely to distract from his father's presidential campaign.

As protests continue to rock different parts
of the country, Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has come out to plead with
youthful Gen Z protesters to call off the ongoing demonstrations, agonizing
over how violence and destructive the protests have become.
According to Gachagua, criminal entities are
now using the demonstrations as a disguise to conduct criminal activities,
resulting in the disruption of businesses and destruction of property.
""What started as peaceful protests have
unfortunately been infiltrated and hijacked by criminals who are now engaged in
looting and creating mayhem,"" said Gachagua on Wednesday.
""As a parent, I appeal to my children,
my sons and daughters, listen to us as your parents. We want to plead with you
to call off the protests so that criminals do not hijack them.""
Gachagua further urged Kenyan youth to agree
to a sit-down with President William Ruto, who he says has shown goodwill by
seeking an audience with them.
""As our children, you owe this country
peace. Please, consider now that you've been heard, don't allow these criminals
an opportunity to take advantage of what you had started in good faith with a
message to the country,"" he said.
The DP further stressed that persons arrested
for causing chaos and looting during the protests will face the full wrath of
the law.
""A mechanism is being worked on how to
address the issues raised. Once you call off the protests then our security
agencies will be in a position to firmly and decisively deal with criminals in

Serani Secondary School has successfully defended their Mombasa County Football Championship after 2-1 win over Tononoka Secondary on Friday.
An Erisat Orute double proved the difference after netting in
each half for the winners.
Athman Hassan had given Tononoka hope when he leveled the
scores at the start of the second half.
Tononoka came to the match seeking retribution after losing to
Serani 2-0 in the Mvita Sub County finals earlier in the tournament but it was
not to be.
Both sides however, advanced to the Coast Region Championships
where the winner will qualify to the national tournament to be held in Kisii
County next month.
Speaking after the victory, ecstatic Serani coach Alex Shikanga
tipped his team to go ahead and punch their ticket to the national finals.
""It was a tough match but I’m happy our boys went for the win and they got it. We won’t rest as focus shifts to Coast Regional Championship and I assure Mombasa that we will represent them well.""
Serani will be boosted by the return of their star William
Gitama who jetted back home on Thursday after his outing with national team Harambee
Stars in the COSAFA Cup tournament in South Africa.
Earlier in the semi finals; Serani edged Moi Forces Academy 1-0
while Tononoka Secondary outclassed Khadija Secondary 2-0.
Moi Forces finished third after 1- 0 win over Khadija Secondary.
At the same time, holders Bomu Secondary School were dethroned
as the girl’s champions after being stunned 5-4 on post match penalties by Mwakirunge

kicks.
Away from football, Baptist Secondary trounced Tudor Day 21-7 to

https://www.citizen.digital/news/liberian-president-cuts-his-salary-by-40-n345464,"Liberian president cuts his salary by 40%
The BBC quoted his office as saying that the decision reflects his commitment to addressing the country's economic challenges and promoting transparency in government spending.
President Boakai's annual salary, which was previously $13,400 (approximately Ksh.1.7 million), will be reduced to $8,000. (Ksh.1.025M).
This initiative responds to growing public dissatisfaction with the rising cost of living, with roughly one in every five Liberians living on less than $2 per day.
The salary cut is also seen as a continuation of the efforts of Boakai's predecessor, George Weah, who implemented a 25% salary reduction during his tenure.
While some citizens have applauded President Boakai's decision, others are sceptical, pointing out that the president still receives substantial benefits such as a daily allowance and comprehensive medical insurance.
In addition to reducing his salary, President Boakai has promised to empower Liberia's Civil Service Agency to ensure fair compensation for public employees.
This commitment follows recent complaints from lawmakers about not receiving their official vehicles, prompting them to protest by arriving at parliament in tuk-tuks, also known as keh keh.
President Boakai, who took office in January after defeating George Weah in a runoff election, has made combating corruption and financial mismanagement top priorities for his administration.
Since taking office, he has declared his assets and ordered an audit of the presidential office, but the results have yet to be released.
He has also strengthened the General Auditing Commission and Liberia's Anti-Corruption Commission.

Operating profit for the world's biggest maker of memory chips, smartphones and TVs likely rose to 8.8 trillion won (approx. Ksh.817.5B) in the quarter ended June 30, according to the average of an LSEG SmartEstimate from 27 analysts, weighted toward those who are more consistently accurate.
That amount would be Samsung's highest profit since the third quarter of 2022. It compares with an operating profit of 670 billion won (Ksh.62.2B) in second quarter of last year.
Performance at the tech giant's key semiconductor division likely continued to improve its second consecutive quarterly profit, as memory chip prices keep rising from a mid-2022 to end-2023 trough that was caused by weak post-pandemic demand for gadgets that use the chips.
Explosive demand for high-end DRAM chips such as high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips used in AI chipsets, as well as chips used in data centre servers and gadgets that run AI services are underpinning a broad recovery in the chip industry, analysts said.
During the second quarter, memory chip prices jumped by about 13% to 18% versus the previous quarter for DRAM chips used in tech devices and 15% to 20% for NAND Flash chips used for data storage, according to data provider TrendForce.
Estimated Q2 operating profit at Samsung's chip division was 4.6 trillion won (Ksh.427.3B) according to an average of 10 analysts' forecasts. This compares to a loss of 4.36 trillion (Ksh.405B) won for the same period last year.
Its mobile business likely saw its Q2 operating profit shrink versus last year despite shipping a similar number of smartphones, analysts said, due to steeper parts' costs and higher marketing and development costs for AI services.
The mobile business likely reported an operating profit of around 2.2 trillion won (Ksh.204.4B), according to an average of forecasts from 10 analysts, down from a 3.04 trillion won (Ksh.282.4B) profit a year ago.
Samsung is expected to compete with rival Apple, opens new tab at the top end of the market when it launches its latest flagship foldable phones and mobile accessories, including a new ring for health monitoring, on July 10 in Paris.

Germany's hopes of winning Euro 2024 on home soil rest with inflicting a very rare defeat on Spain's midfield maestro Rodri in Friday's blockbuster quarter-final.
Since La Roja last lost a competitive game to Scotland in March 2023, Rodri has played 77 matches for club and country and tasted defeat just once when Manchester United beat his Manchester City in May's FA Cup final.
In that time the 28-year-old has won two Premier League titles, the Champions League, one FA Cup, the UEFA Super Cup and the Club World Cup, as well as guiding his country to Nations League glory.
""In his position, he is the best - he can do everything. The quality, he reads the game, his mentality, he is always ready,"" said City boss Pep Guardiola, who has overseen a collection of some of the best midfielders ever to grace the sport.
""He is so good at many things...The presence, the physicality, he is complete.""
Spain have dazzled so far at Euro 2024 - the only side to have won all four of their matches en route to the quarter-finals.
Wonder kid wingers Yamine Lamal and Nico Williams have given Luis de la Fuente's side a direct threat that even the great Spain team that won three consecutive major tournaments between 2008 and 2012 lacked.
Fabian Ruiz, Pedri and Dani Olmo provide extra guile from midfield and even the much-maligned Alvaro Morata has moved into a share of third place for the most goals in European Championship history.
However, Rodri's all-round importance as the anchor to this Spanish side was evidenced in the last 16 against Georgia.
Trailing to Robin Le Normand's own goal despite not having faced a shot on target, Spain were beginning to be flustered by not taking advantage of their dominance of the ball and chances.
Just after the half hour mark, Rodri took possession, paused and issued an instruction of calm to his teammates.
Moments later he arrowed a low shot into the far corner for the equaliser that served as the launch pad for a 4-1 win.
""Sometimes 20 or 30 seconds of saying to people 'calm down' is more productive than going on the attack,"" Rodri said of his message of reassurance to the team.
Morata may wear the captain's armband, but Rodri has developed into the leader of Spain's new generation, keen to break free from the shadow of their all-conquering predecessors.
""We have Rodri, who is a perfect computer,"" said De la Fuente.
""He administers everything, all the emotions, all the moments in a magisterial way; that's a great help for everyone.""
Despite being one of the world's leading lights in his position for a number of seasons, this is his first major tournament as Spain's starting six.
At the 2022 World Cup he was used as a centre-back by Luis Enrique to accomodate an ageing Sergio Busquets.
The Barcelona legend's international retirement cut the final chord to Spain's last major tournament win in 2012.
Now Rodri's generation want to write their own story to become national heroes.
""Germany will be strong at home, but they will be worried about us too,"" said the former Atletico Madrid man of the clash in Stuttgart.
""We came to win and we are not afraid. Our mentality is to go on Friday with everything we have against Germany.""
Should Spain get their way, another midfield great will play his final match.
Toni Kroos will retire after the tournament and the man who spent the last decade of his club career in Spain with Real Madrid, showed his respect for his opposite number in the quarter-finals.
""I think he is someone who exudes enthusiasm, who is not prone to making mistakes, even under pressure, which always gives a lot to the team,"" said Kroos.
""On top of that, in the last one or two years, he has also scored goals, important goals.""
Rodri's strike won City their first ever Champions League in the 2023 final.
Now he is aiming to make his major tournament breakthrough and break German hearts along the way.

With traffic snarled around Paris and political
uncertainty hanging over France, Parisians are struggling to get in the mood
for the Olympics party that will begin next month.
The spectacular one-off stadiums that will host
sport from July 26 are now nearing completion at tourist hotspots around the
City of Light, including at the Eiffel Tower, Place de la Concorde and the
Invalides.
But one of the downsides of building temporary
facilities at the heart of the city -- a deliberate choice to lower costs and
carbon emissions -- is the disruption to the daily lives of residents.
Several major thoroughfares have been closed off or
restricted, while new cycle and Olympics VIP lanes are further squeezing
traffic to a standstill in some areas of the capital.
""No kidding, I see a physical fight in my
street almost every day between drivers,"" Julien Rivet, a lawyer who lives
in the centre near the Louvre museum, told AFP.
He like many other Parisians he has decided to leave
the capital with his family for the duration of Games, which run from July
26-August 11, followed by the Paralympics from August 28-September 8.
Others who earn their livings on Paris' roads, from
courier cyclists and delivery drivers to taxi operators are also struggling.
""We can't work any more... it's a
catastrophe,"" complained 52-year-old taxi driver Abdel as he stood in
traffic near the Place de la Concorde, the venue for Olympics skateboarding,
BMX freestyle and breakdancing that is usually a key roundabout.
Organisers insist that Parisians will end up
appreciating the Games once they start and that the pre-event grumbling is
normal.
""I've been lucky enough to be involved in the
Olympic Games in one way or another since 1982 and you always hear the same
things,"" Etienne Thobois, director general of the Paris 2024 organising
committee, told AFP on Tuesday.
""It's true that our concept of having a large
number of temporary sites in the heart of the city, obviously with that, there
are constraints, but I feel like people are seeing what we're doing,"" he
added.
""Ultimately, tourist and cultural activities
have not been disturbed,"" he added. ""You definitely need to plan your
journeys a bit and make sure you're informed, but life is carrying on,
businesses are working, hotels are functioning.""
Many tourists in the city seem curious about the
work going on around them, while giant Olympic rings installed midway up the
Eiffel Tower have become a new attraction.
""I see everywhere that they are fixing the
buildings and preparing for these big games, so it should be nice,""
Iranian tourist Mohsen, 48, told AFP.
Instead of the Olympics, attention in France remains
focused on snap parliamentary elections called by President Emmanuel Macron on
June 9.
Voters are set to go to the polls on Sunday for the
first of two rounds ahead of the start of the Games.
Polls show the far-right National Rally in the lead,
which could see them emerge as the biggest parliamentary group and possibly at
the head of the government for the first time.
Anne Hidalgo sharpened her criticism of Macron on
Wednesday, saying he had ruined the atmosphere.
""In an act of mistreatment of French people,
the president is spoiling the party,"" Hidalgo told the Ouest France
newspaper of Macron's decision to dissolve parliament on June 9.
The Olympics are ""a coming-together of humanity
through sport. Why undermine this beautiful moment with this election that was
called in a hurry, without consulting anyone?"" the Socialist mayor added.
Analysts and security sources have raised the risk
of protests and even violence if the anti-immigration National Rally (RN)
secures power on July 7 in what would be a seismic change for France.
Macron has called the election a moment of
""clarification"" and has warned about voting for the
""extremes"", both the RN and the new left-wing alliance that includes
moderate Socialists and far-left Communists.
Polls show his centrist bloc trailing in third and
facing major losses.
""My responsibility... is to do everything""
so that the Games are ""a moment of harmony, of celebration and not of
violence,"" added Hidalgo, who ran against Macron in the last presidential
election in 2022.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/hitches-as-kenyans-unable-to-join-president-rutos-x-space-n345283,"Hitches as Kenyans unable to join President Ruto’s X Space
The majority of Kenyans were unable access President William Ruto’s Space conversation that sought to engage the youth on critical issues affecting the nation.
The Space
conversation began an hour late and Ruto initiated the discussions as he
thanked the Gen Zs for engaging matters that are based on issues and not about
politics or political affiliation.
Almost soon thereafter,
the President’s Space developed technical hitches as the sound went mute.
Conversations could be heard from the background with Ruto talking with his
staff to know whether he could be heard.
The President,
through his official X account, attempted to host the Space three
time without success.
Meanwhile,
Kenyans online decided to join a parallel Space hosted by influencer Osama
Otero also titled ‘Engage the President.’ The Space was co-hosted alongside
State House spokesperson Hussein Mohamed.
An hour
later, Ruto joined Otero’s Space as a listener whereby he got the opportunity
to address Kenyans.
“I want to
apologise for the last hour we have not had a proper connection due to
technology. I apologise,” he said.
While
addressing an issue that he was out of touch with reality, Ruto defended
himself that he only acts on information that is credible from the relevant
authorities.
“I have the
benefit of more information in my hands. What I cannot do is operate on numbers
that have no basis. I said 25 Kenyans died out of protests. Some reckless
people have put the numbers all the way to 100. Others said there was a
massacre in Githurai, that was not true,” Ruto said.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/talk-about-what-kenyans-want-change-ekuru-aukot-dismisses-ruto-raila-proposal-n345652,"‘Talk about what? Kenyans want change’: Ekuru Aukot dismisses Ruto-Raila proposal
Thirdway Alliance party leader Ekuru Aukot has rubbished President William Ruto’s call for dialogue with Kenyans following the recent anti-government protests.
Ruto and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga on Tuesday announced a six-day multi-sectoral dialogue forum drawing representatives from political parties, religious groups, civil society, employers and youth to discuss issues pressing Kenyans beginning Monday, July 15.
In an interview with Citizen TV on
Thursday, Aukot dismissed the talks as a politician-led deviation from
the issues Kenyans want addressed.
He dismissed Ruto’s dialogue call, saying
the government is yet to even acknowledge and apologise for the killings and violence
meted out on Kenyans during the protests against the Finance Bill, 2024.
“You cannot dialogue with a person who has
not even apologised to you… Talk about what? What Kenyans are asking for is
results, change and accountability,” said Aukot.
“Let us not divert; this is just another
handshake loading,” he added, referring to Odinga’s political truce with
retired president Uhuru Kenyatta on March 9, 2018, after 2017’s disputed presidential
election results.
According to the Thirdway Alliance leader, Ruto’s
government is fooling Kenyans.
“You cannot deny that there were disappearances
and deaths and that people were shot. The statistics are there and this is the
age of technology; you cannot fool people,” he said.
More than 39 people were killed in the
demonstrations between June 18 and July 1, according to the Kenya National
Commission on Human Rights, which reported 361 injuries, 32 cases of
""enforced or involuntary disappearances"" and 627 arrests of protesters.
However, President Ruto’s government has
denied that police officers were involved in abductions and even defended the
conduct of plainclothes police officers, who were linked to the abductions and
killings.
Interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki has
said the government will take action against “claims of abductions and enforced
disappearances allegedly perpetrated by security personnel” during the
protests.
Ruto eventually declined to assent to the
Bill after mounting public pressure, instead announcing austerity measures to
cover the budgetary provisions that the Bill sought to raise through increased
taxation.
In Aukot’s view, the President has put the
country “into a dysfunctional state.” He cited Ruto’s signing of the
Appropriations Bill, 2024 into law after the Finance Bill was withdrawn.
“How do you sign an Appropriations Bill,
which is an expenditure law, without a Finance Bill, which is how you collect
the money? By deleting an entire Bill, you are telling Kenyans that we do not
have a House that can legislate for you, that can pass a law that is of common
good to people,” he said.
“The lies from back to 2022 are now catching
up on him and his government. You overpromised people knowing very well that
you were lying to them and that is why we are dealing with a dysfunctional
government.”
Ruto and Raila’s dialogue push has however
been met with backlash from Kenyan youth, who maintain that they want
accountability from the government.
Following Tuesday’s announcement, a section
of youth on social media questioned Odinga's capacity in the talks as they distanced
themselves from being represented by political figures.
“Raila, as you go ahead and dialogue,
kindly don't involve us. Discuss your private matters. You don't speak on our
behalf,” X user 5peopleke wrote.
Similarly, Narc Kenya party leader Martha
Karua, who was Odinga's presidential running mate in the 2022 General Election termed
the move ""a trap"" likely to benefit “a handful of elites.”
""Let’s be careful as the political
class lest we hijack the genuine clamour for accountability and reforms by the
Gen-Z. This is a trap period,"" Karua wrote on X.
The Wiper Party, a member of Odinga’s
Azimio La Umoja One Kenya coalition, has also instead called on the government
to address the issues Kenyans raised during the recent protests rather than
pushing for a meeting with their so-called representatives.

The two leaders agreed to commence a six-day multi-sectorial forum which is set to begin on Monday, July 15, and end on Saturday to foster national dialogue and seek lasting solutions to Kenya's pressing issues following the Gen Z-driven anti-taxation protests.
""I am happy to confirm that we have had consultations and we have agreed that dialogue is the way forward out of the crisis that we’re having today in our country,"" said Mr Odinga.
""We agreed that we give people an opportunity to be heard, to express themselves, to come out with the grievances which are actually ailing our country today so that a lasting solution can be found.""
Minutes after the public announcement, Kenyans online, mostly the youth, fired at Mr Odinga questioning in what capacity he would be taking part in the talks as many distanced themselves from being represented by political quotas.
Odinga's 2022 General Election running mate Martha Karua termed the move ""a trap"", adding that it will hinder the existence of meaningful talks to iron out the demands for Gen Zs.
""I agree with those who say Action Now on the clear and attainable demands of the GenZ to enhance accountability and make the state work for the masses rather than for a handful elites,"" she wrote on X.
""Let’s be careful as the political class lest we hijack the genuine clamor for accountability and reforms by the GenZ. This is a trap period.""
Odinga's biological son also chimed into the online clamor, seemingly distancing himself from his father's opinions saying ""Everybody is an individual please! Even people with the same exact names.""
Other Kenyans hopped on the ridicule bandwagon insisting that dialogue between Odinga and the government has always collapsed and he will not be allowed to represent the youth in any capacity whatsoever.
Odinga's private credentials including his mobile phone numbers were later paraded on the platform, customary to how any individual acting against the demands of the Gen Z has been treated.
Photoshopped images showing Odinga donning a UDA t-shirt were also being shared widely by the time of this publication.
X user 5peopleke said ""Raila, as you go ahead and dialogue, kindly don't involve us. Discuss your private matters. You don't speak on our behalf.""
Another user Cornelius Ronoh said ""The dialogue is between two individuals; William Ruto and Raila Odinga. We refuse to be controlled by selfish politicians who only value their stomachs. Gen Zs and Millennials are now taking the bull by the horns. Hatupangwingwi. They will not believe!""
The Government Critic also wrote ""We told Raila Odinga to rest and let us handle our on matter. We are not going to dialogue with President William Ruto. We know how it ends and Baba is a clear example how dialogue never works!""
Prominent Kenyan X user Cyprian Nyakundi added ""Raila Odinga is the biggest enemy of the Gen-Z movement. He has been worried all along because it's now clear that Kenyans can unite without him, putting his bargaining power at risk.""
The vexed youths have maintained that they will not tire to mount pressure against government and will remain leaderless and without any political representation.

The Kenya rugby Under-20 team head coach Simon
Jawichre says the team is moving in the right direction despite losing 25-7 to
Uruguay in their opening match at the 2024 World U20 trophy tournament in
Scotland.
Despite a promising start to the match, Chipu
struggled to contain a well-oiled Uruguayan machine with Kenya’s only try in
the game coming from former captain Michael Wamalwa.
Jawichre rued the missed chances early on in
the first half saying they must be more clinical in the upcoming games if they
are to bag more points.
“The game went well; it didn’t go that bad. I
believe our objectives would’ve been met if you just closed down on quality
issues here and there. We really should have posted some scores by halftime
which we didn’t, we worked through it and I think we had a good beginning of
the second half and individuals stood up and they scored. They got their try
after taking us back half the pitch and then mauling after a line up,” Jawichre
assessed.
Jawichre says they will retreat and
re-strategise before facing Netherlands in their second pool match on Sunday,
July 7 2024.
“We didn’t have the start we were praying to
have but we are talking about Uruguay; Uruguay is a pedigree team, one of the
top teams in the world and I think we put in a good fight and the game was
truly beyond us. We look forward to the next one, we will put our best foot
forward but I think we are in a good place,” noted Jawichre.
The Kenya Under-20 team is making their fourth
appearance in the World U-20 Trophy, after hosting the tournament last year with
prior appearances in the world showpiece coming in 2009 and 2019 (Brazil).

https://www.citizen.digital/wananchi-reporting/story-za-jaba-citizens-lament-over-delays-in-passport-processing-n345504,"‘Story za jaba?’ Citizens lament over delays in passport processing
A lot has changed over the years from the long queues that used to be witnessed at the gate at the wee hours of the morning, with Kenyans hoping to get their applications processed and get the document.
With automation of several services, Kenyans are now required to make their applications online and book an appointment to have their biometrics taken at Nyayo House.
In April, the government, through Interior CS Kithure Kindiki said passport applications will from May 1, have their passport applications processed within three weeks, adding that from September 1 it would take three days for the document to be processed.
However, a section of Kenyans have complained that it is taking longer than the stipulated time to get their passports processed, putting some in a fix as they seek to travel.
Speaking to Wananchi Reporting on Monday, Victor Maina lamented about the delays in having his children’s passports processed.
“I had hoped to travel with my children as I take up a new job abroad, however, they are still in Kenya, two months after applying for their passports despite the government saying that the documents would be ready in three weeks,” he said.
He also took issue with the fact that people still have to queue to have their biometrics taken, despite booking slots when making their applications online.
Maina said, “While it is a good thing that people no longer have to queue outside the gate very early in the morning, there are still delays in getting biometrics taken as you have to make another queue while inside the building despite having booked an appointment.’
Speaking during a previous interview on Citizen TV, Immigration PS Julius Bitok had urged those who have been waiting for their passports for a while to consider visiting the respective Immigration offices to see if their documents are among those that have been lying in storage wating for collection.
However, some Wananchi said that they have had no success receiving the document.
Timothy Warui, said, “I had to opt for the 50-page passport because the 34 page series was not available. While it was out of my budget, I needed the document urgently to travel but even after paying the Ksh. 9,550 for the document, I am still waiting for it to be ready, three months later.”
There was a shortage of the 34-page series (Ksh. 7,500) earlier in the year, and the government, through Spokesperson Isaac Mwaura, had in February advised those in urgent need of travel to opt for the 50-page series (Ksh. 9,500).
He had said the series would be back in circulation ‘soon’, without giving a definitive date.
Mwaura said the shortage had been caused by slow delivery of the booklets by the supplier.
Another person, Michael Matiko, said, “The announcement of the document being ready in three weeks ‘ni story za jaba’ (is not true) I was supposed to travel for a work related conference in May, but the opportunity passed me by because the document was not ready in good time. This is after having applied for the document months ahead of time. Whenever I would check the status of my application, I would find it in 'production' stage.”
However, it has not been all gloom and doom for all applicants.
Jessica Kimani, said she got her passport in good time.
She said, “I managed to get my passport processed within a month and travelled. Perhaps those who have had issues could consider going to the Immigration offices to confirm whether their documents could be lying there as they wait thinking they are yet to be processed.”
As Kenyans continue to wait for their documents to be processed, they have called on the government to speed up the process.

Masai, 29, was shot by police officers during the anti-Finance bill demonstrations on June 20 and was laid to rest on July 5 amid public outcry.
IPOA, which had already launched investigations into Masai's fatal shooting, has said that the witness accounts will aid in holding the involved police accountable and give the family closure.
Information can be shared by calling 1559 or 0204906000.
The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) had directed IPOA on June 21 to probe the killing and forward an inquiry report before the lapse of 21 days.
IPOA's Chairperson Anne Makori in a statement said the state agency had been monitoring police conduct since the onset of the protests on Tuesday, June 18.
She noted that both protestors and police largely showed restraint but highlighted specific incidents such as the case of Masai and injuries sustained by other protesters during the demonstrations, further calling for restraint by the police.
Meanwhile, Kenyans are calling for conclusive investigations into all protesters who were shot dead in different parts of the nation during the anti-government protests.
The government claims that 25 people have been killed and 400 have been injured but the Kenya Human Rights Commission (KHRC) says that at least 43 people were killed during the demonstrations, and over 600 were injured in varying degrees.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/drama-as-kilifi-protesters-are-re-arrested-minutes-after-being-set-free-by-court-n345203,"Drama as Kilifi protesters are re-arrested minutes after being set free by court
According to Sofia Rajab, a human rights lawyer based in Kilifi, the protesters, numbering about ten, had been presented before the Chief Magistrate Court in Kilifi to be charged with unlawful gatherings and other related offences.
One of the arrested protesters was Katherine Mwanase, a renowned Kilifi activist who had been arrested alongside two others.
On Wednesday, July 3, however, the magistrate freed all the suspects after a lengthy court session, and Rajab shared photos of the released Kenyans - but with a rather odd circumstance.
Rajab said that, soon after they were released by the court, the Kilifi police re-arrested every one of them, throwing them into the cells, again.
""So we managed to get them released...then they got lured into another police trap and re-arrested!"" She wrote.
Seeking to explain exactly what led to the fresh arrest, despite the court order, Rajab said that the protesters were lured by the police to go and collect their valuables at the police station - only to be re-arrested.
She wrote: ""So the police filed a miscellaneous application seeking to detain the suspects for 10 days to allow for investigations. We anticipated this would happen. Btw, they added other protesters who were arrested the night before- we only knew 7 mins before the hearing when we were served.""
""We represented all of them. And not only did we kill it, we embarrassed them and they felt some type of way. Now, we leave court happy taking selfies and an IO (Investigating Officer) calls the now-released persons to collect confiscated items (phones, bike etc). The lawyers advise against this.
""Because a group of DCI officers were lurking in the corner and it looked suspicious. We told them to go home and come back another day. The material items are not worth your freedom. Go enjoy it after a night in jail. But they trusted the police.
""As soon as they enter the DCI office...handcuffs. They claim that the Court did NOT order their release. Meanwhile, its around 5pm, the order is yet to be extracted, but the Court staff made sure to stay behind until the order was typed, stamped and signed. By then, DCI vanished.
""So our clients were taken to Kilifi Police Station and will spend the night there. We live to fight another day. They will be charged tomorrow...for what? We shall find out in the morning.""
K-town Photography, a Kilifi-based professional photographer also appeared to back up Rajab's story.
He said,""Police calling themselves DCI officers in kilifi were asked to release the arrested peaceful protestors in Kilifi yesterday by the law court of Kilifi. They asked them to go for their IDs and phones and have decided to rearrest them WITHOUT cause!""
This comes as all the 187 protesters who were apprehended during Tuesday's anti-government protests, including children, were released on bond.
Law Society of Kenya (LSK) president Faith Odhiambo said that the apprehended persons were presented before the Milimani Law Courts on Wednesday where they faced various charges.
The adults were each given a bond of Ksh.50,000 and would be released after providing details of their families and relatives.
The court further gave the police till 10am (June 4) to avail details of all arrested persons to deal with the tendency of frustrating release processes even after court orders are issued.

""It reflects our commitment to ensuring that no one is left behind and that sustainable development is achieved in a manner that is inclusive, participatory, and equitable.""
A key theme of the report is the involvement of diverse stakeholders, particularly civil society organizations, in driving sustainable development efforts.
Festus Wangwe, Director of Planning in the State Department of MSME, highlighted the collaborative effort involving over 60 CSOs across various sectors in compiling the report.
""It is indeed a great milestone and a demonstration of the commitment of civil society organizations in complementing government efforts in the implementation of the SDGs in the country,"" said Wangwe.

Oleksandr Usyk has confirmed he will vacate his IBF title just
weeks after he became undisputed world heavyweight champion.
The Ukrainian, 37, became the first heavyweight to hold the IBF,

Arabia last month.
With Usyk now contracted to a rematch with Britain's Fury, he is
not in a position to defend the IBF crown against interim champion and
mandatory challenger Daniel Dubois.
That means Dubois' expected all-British fight against Anthony
Joshua at Wembley in September could now be for the vacant title.
Usyk said in a video posted on social media: ""Anthony and
Daniel, listen. I know the IBF title is important to you. It is my present to
you on September 21.""
Britain's
Lennox Lewis was the last man to unify the major heavyweight belts -- three at

https://www.citizen.digital/news/south-africas-ramaphosa-announces-cabinet-that-includes-ex-opposition-leader-n344965,"South Africa's Ramaphosa announces cabinet that includes ex-opposition leader
Ramaphosa's African National Congress was forced to join forces with rival parties to stay in power after losing its majority for the first time in three decades in a May 29 election.
The announcement of the new cabinet of the government of national unity followed weeks of protracted and at times acrimonious negotiations.
Ramaphosa retained the ANC's Enoch Godongwana as finance minister while Ronald Lamola was appointed minister of international relations and cooperation, replacing Naledi Pandor.
Gwede Mantashe stayed on as mineral and petroleum resources minister but the president removed energy from his portfolio. The combination of mineral resources had been seen by many as creating a prejudice in favour of coal as a source of power generation.
Energy will now fall within the portfolio of Electricity Minister Kgosientsho Ramokgopa.
""These men and women we have appointed to the executive ... reflect the diversity of our nation,"" Ramaphosa said. ""In the spirit of partnership and collaboration, the incoming government will work together.""
Wrangling over who gets what cabinet seat was the last hurdle to setting up a government, which now faces the task of reviving a moribund economy, fixing crumbling roads and power stations and creating jobs for the third of South Africans out of work.
""We look forward to being part of a new era in South Africa’s democratic journey, and to bringing real and tangible change to the millions of citizens who voted for it,"" Steenhuisen said in a statement following the announcement.
Some minor parties also saw their leaders receive cabinet posts.
ANC TOOK HIT AT POLLS
For decades the ANC had traded on its legacy of ending apartheid 30 years ago, when Nelson Mandela came to power and successfully reconciled a country deeply divided along racial, ethnic and class lines.
But voters became angered by the ANC's poor record on delivering on basic services including water, schools and electricity.
""It is a major shake-up with very few of the old faces still in there, which is a good thing,"" said Melanie Verwoerd, political analyst and former South African diplomat. ""I think in general it's a very positive step and of course very positive that they could actually get this done.""
Whether the current loose coalition of former enemies can improve on the ANC's record may depend on the extent to which they can put aside their ideological differences, analysts have said. There are several potential hurdles to policymaking.
The DA wants to scrap some of the ANC's Black empowerment programmes, saying that they have mostly made a politically connected business elite fabulously wealthy while much of the Black majority stays poor.
It opposes the ANC's desire to expropriate land - most of which is in white hands as a legacy of conquest by colonists and subsequent entrenched white minority rule - without compensation and give it to Black farmers.
The DA also seeks to phrase out South Africa's minimum wage, currently sitting at 27.58 rand ($1.52) a hour, arguing it makes the workforce uncompetitive.

During the workshop, CCA released a report derived from the inaugural East African Employability Summit (EAES23) held in 2024. The report highlighted measures that stakeholders in the job market and educational sector can adopt to make young people fit for the work environment.
Part of the solutions as contained in the report include fostering inclusive education and training, developing agile policy and governance revamping linkages between learning and industry.
Stakeholders also resolved to establish on-campus innovation hubs to catalyse co-creation, entrepreneurship and start-up culture to spur self-employment and embrace Artificial intelligence in learning.
“The summit is a ground-breaking platform converging diverse stakeholders to rethink the future of the EAC region in the heat of the unemployment crisis compounded by the youth bulge and employability skills disparities” Philip Pande, Executive Director, Corporate Career Academy (CCA) said.
“This collaboration is more than just a partnership; it is a convergence of shared visions and goals. Together, we are committed to equipping our students with the skills, knowledge, and values necessary to excel in their careers and make meaningful contributions to society,” Professor Faith Nguru, Deputy Vice Chancellor, Academic, Research and Student Affair, Daystar University said.
Lack of unemployment especially among young Africans remains a thorn in the flesh of the continent’s economy.

“Kenya is a beautiful place with amazing athletes in wrestling, so far what I have seen here is great. This event also sends a statement to the rest of Africa as we all yearn to develop wrestling and vie for gold medals in international competitions such as the Olympics,” said Aka, who hails from Ivory Coast.
He promised to be visiting Kenya more often as the world wrestling governing body is now interested in developing wrestling in Kenya and across East Africa in general.
Hosts Kenya will battle it out with neighbors Uganda and Tanzania, as Burundi, Mauritius and Sudan are the other countries seeking the regional's top honors in amateur wrestling.
KAWA has also confirmed that notable continental stars will grace the event led by Uganda's Harriet Akite, who won a gold medal in the second edition of the National Olympics Committee of Kenya (NOC-K) beach games held at the Buntwani Beach, Malindi in February.
Another notable name will be African champion Kanapetradu vihanshy Simran from Mauritius and African silver medalist Niyonkuru Gloria Lynca from Burundi.
KAWA has also tasked Linus Masheti to be now the Technical
Director of both the men's and the women's national teams, and the veteran
coach has now promised that the final squads to represent Kenya in all
categories will be named on Wednesday.

Gor Mahia have their sights firmly set on Cecafa Kagame Cup triumph a few days after they were crowned the FKF-Premier League champions for an unprecedented 21st time.
Assistant coach Michael Nam says the squad will resume training next week ahead of the competition scheduled to take place from July 6 to 22 in Zanzibar and Tanzania.
Gor Mahia, three-time champions, are the sole Kenyan club invited to the regional inter-club tournament, which is making a comeback after a two-year hiatus and Nam has backed his charges to replicate their local form in Tanzania.
“We expect all players to be back in training on the first day of July. We have numerous business ahead of us and seriousness is key,” said Nam.
Nam, who has been the assistant to the immediate former head coach Jonathan MCKinstry, says they will include the names of their players who are on international duty with the Emerging Stars in the COSAFA tournament in South Africa, hoping they will join them in Tanzania.
“Cecafa has given each participating team a maximum of 25 players’ slots and we intend to forward the names, including those on international duty in South Africa. We need a strong squad for all the matches ahead of us.”
Five Gor players are with the under-23 national team and they include Paul Ochuoga, Benson Omalla, Austin Odhiambo, Sylvester Owino and Rooney Onyango.
According to Nam, the inclusion of five of their own is an indication that they have a strong squad for their assignments and also a strong youthful side.
Meanwhile, the champions are expected to name their new head coach later in the week.
Club chairman Ambrose Rachier said last Monday that they are through with the vetting process and have settled on the man to take charge of the record champions after the exit of MCKinstry.
The team is also expected to bolster their squad ahead of the CAF Champions League.
The club chairman had earlier indicated that they will urgently need a mature goalkeeper as well as a striker and at least two midfielders.
Currently, Gor has four goalkeepers including Kevin Omondi, Gad Mathew, Dolph Owino and Caleb Otieno.
“The office is working on transfer issues and when the window opens, they will release the names of the incoming and outgoing players. The public should just be patient with us, but definitely we are recruiting,” he added.
Gor will also be warming up for an invitation tournament in Enugu, Nigeria starting August 1.
The tournament will comprise eight teams from various countries and each match played will earn each team USD 5,000 as part of winning bonuses.
MC’Kinstry indicated his confidence that Gor will cruise past the quarter finals of the continental club championship.
According to MC’Kinstry, the good relationship between the players, technical bench and the office can take Gor Mahia to greater heights.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/stubborn-biden-dismisses-calls-to-quit-in-key-tv-interview-n345346,"Stubborn Biden dismisses calls to quit in key TV interview
With rebellion brewing among some nervous Democratic voters, lawmakers and donors, the one-to-one with the ABC network was hyped as the most consequential of the 81-year-old president's long career.
But the 22-minute sit-down appeared to provide little reassurance, as Biden blamed sickness for his sub-par performance and repeatedly dismissed polling and fears within his party that the debate had gravely wounded his prospects.
""I was sick, I was feeling terrible... I just had a really bad cold,"" said the president, in his first unscripted remarks of any length since last week's showdown with Republican rival Donald Trump.
The interview was intended to help Biden weather the storm, but his hoarse voice and meandering answers drew immediate Democratic fire for appearing ""out of touch.""
Asked if staying in the race might jeopardize Democrats holding on to the White House, Biden said: ""I don't think anybody's more qualified to be president or win this race than me.""
He dodged calls to have doctors assess his mental acuity, saying that the duties of the presidency mean ""I have a cognitive test every single day. Every day I have that test, everything I do.""
The Trump campaign mockingly posted on social media that ""Biden sounds great"" as the broadcast went out, before concluding the president ""is in denial and in decline.""
The interview came after Biden was hesitant and often incoherent during the debate against Trump in Atlanta, leading to panic within his party and calls for him to pull out of the race.
- 'I'll beat Trump' -
The Biden campaign has pushed back hard on any suggestion he may withdraw and, just hours before the ABC interview, released an aggressive campaign travel schedule for the rest of July.
Appearing at a campaign rally in Madison, Wisconsin, the president delivered an energetic stump speech, unequivocally declaring, ""I'm staying in the race. I'll beat Donald Trump.""
Post-debate polls have shown a widening deficit in Trump's favour, and at least four Democrats in Congress have called on Biden to step aside, as have major newspapers, donors and a raft of Democratic-supporting political commentators.
Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Mark Warner and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries were both planning crisis talks with lawmakers in the coming days, US media reported.
In Friday's interview, ABC host George Stephanopoulos repeatedly referenced the growing Democratic clamour for a conversation on picking a new candidate, asking Biden if he would step down if convinced he couldn't beat Trump.
""Well, it depends. If the Lord Almighty comes down and tells me that, I might do that,"" he said.
Biden added that he had not watched the debate afterwards, saying ""I don't think I did, no.""
And he dismissed the idea that his poor performance was a sign of a more serious health problem.
""It was a bad episode, no indication of any serious condition. I was exhausted. I didn't listen to my instincts in terms of preparing and -- and I had a bad night,"" Biden said.
David Axelrod, a top aide in Barack Obama's White House and an occasional thorn in the side of the Biden administration, said the interview showed a president ""dangerously out of touch"" with concerns over his fitness for office.
""Four years ago at this time, he was 10 points ahead of Trump (in polls). Today, he is six points behind,"" Axelrod posted on X.
The White House has announced Biden will visit Pennsylvania this weekend before holding a press conference during the NATO summit in Washington next week.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/the-conflict-of-interest-bill-2023-brings-out-true-colors-of-senators-n345493,"The Conflict of Interest Bill 2023 brings out true colors of Senators
The bill seeks to maintain public trust in public institutions and reduce the risk of corruption, favoritism and bias, thereby upholding the integrity of public service.
It also seeks to ensure trust between citizens and public institutions. This could lead to greater citizen engagement, cooperation and support for government initiatives.
The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) mandate often overlaps with efforts to combat corruption. By administering the Act, if it is passed into law, there will be better coordination between conflict of interest management and broader anti-corruption initiatives, thereby maximizing the effectiveness of both.
STRONG VESTED INTERESTS
When the Conflict of Interest Bill 2023 made its way to parliament little was known of the way it would rattle the status quo of strong vested interests beginning with the Senate.
On May 16, 2024, Senators showed a never witnessed solidarity voting to amend the bill. The Conflict of Interest Bill 2023 sought, in effect, to reverse what was made possible by The Public Service Structure and Remuneration Commission of 1970, otherwise known as the Ndegwa Commission.
The Conflict of Interest Bill 2023, is proposed to be administered by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) to ensure that no public or state officers are involved in matters that conflict of interest in all their dealings, and adhere to compliance measures in their dealings at all times.
However the Senate, charged with ensuring public interest and vested with the power to pass the Bill into law, alongside the National Assembly, have decided to cut its leg by either deleting or watering down its stringent clauses.
NDEGWA COMMISSION PROPOSAL
The Ndegwa Commission report was presented and made operational by the government in 1971. Its core mandate was to advice the government on issues of remuneration, performance and management within the public sector.
In an era immediately post-independence, it sought to pursue “Africanization” of the commercial and industrial sectors in the country, but by that very act, the Ndegwa commission gave leeway to holders of public interest to pursue commercial interests, indeed with while still employed by the public sector.
Before this time, there had been a ban on holding shares in commercial entities by public or state officers.
All this was done, ostensibly, in good faith, to stop the repatriation of commercial profits to countries out of Kenya.
Many pundits allude to the Ndegwa report’s adoption as the water-shed moment in the history of corruption in Kenya. From this point forward, corruption within the public sector was supported by policy and with no proper code of ethics to reign in top public officials, corruption produced public sector multi-millionaires in a very short time as public sector services took a nose dive affecting the citizenry to date.
In advanced countries world over, the wealthiest class of citizens would most likely be found among industrialists, multi-national business entities, Information Technology service trailblazers, Sports, Art, Music and Film icons, among others.
However, in Kenya, just akin to other jurisdictions facing endemic corruption within the public sector, there exists a political class that is outrageously wealthy without a clear process of creating fundamental impact within the communities where they live or serve. They own no industries and offer no services, their only claim to legitimacy is trade with the government.
A UNITED HOUSE
When the Conflict of Interest Bill 2023 made its way to the Senate a lot was expected of the higher house to pull their weight in the right direction and close the door to single biggest contributor of corruption in government, open conflict of interest in trading with their employer.
With none bolting out, and none preserving the intention and integrity of the Bill, all twenty five senators present opted to amend the Bill, thereby watering it down and in the process defeating the very purpose for which it was introduced.
The Bill is therefore headed to the National Assembly where eyes are on the Members of Parliament to see if they will emulate their Senate counterparts and proceed to water down the Bill of if they will for once stick with the common good and pass the Bill in its original form.
This is not to say that the Conflict of Interest Bill 2023 had no need absolutely for any amendment to be done.
A few clauses needed clarity, there were instances that the Bill presented numerical typos and of course they were several instances where legal minds thought was intrusion into public officers lives and hence the need to protect private space and also clauses that were ambiguous and would have done with more concise and precise wording for brevity.
The Public Officer Ethics Act 2003 suggested a repeal of (“the Public Officer Ethics Act”). It also proposed transitional provisions facilitate the smooth implementation of legislative changes by providing a framework for transitioning from the old legal regime to the new one, ensuring a seamless transition for affected individuals.
All eyes are now on the National Assembly to pass the Bill undefiled or else it will be yet another sterile attempt to stop public officials from ratified plunder of public resources.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/kenyan-activists-rethink-strategy-after-protests-turn-violent-n345185,"Kenyan activists rethink strategy after protests turn violent
The activists say the violence was the work of ""goons"" hired by politicians to either discredit legitimate demonstrators or advance their own agendas. Some called on social media for the next planned demonstration on Thursday not to go ahead.
""It seems the state has realised that the only way to counter this movement is by using goons to incite violence, break into people's property, loot, and tarnish our cause,"" Ojango Omondi, an activist in the capital Nairobi, told Reuters.
""It's time to go back to the drawing board and strategise on how best to overcome this violence and keep our protests focused on their true objectives.""
Kenya's government spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement on Tuesday, Interior Minister Kithure Kindike blamed violence on ""hordes of marauding criminal gangs"" and said there was an attempt to ""politicise crime"".
The initial protests last month against proposed tax hikes were overwhelmingly peaceful, although the police fired tear gas and water cannon at demonstrators.
The mobilisation of Kenyans from across ethnic lines around common economic demands marked a break with previous protest movements that have typically been organised by political figures with ethnic grievances often at the fore.
The protests became violent as some demonstrators briefly stormed parliament last week and the police opened fire, killing dozens.
The next day, Ruto withdrew the tax increases. But protesters vowed to carry on, issuing a range of demands, from anti-corruption measures to Ruto's resignation.
Almost from the outset, protests on Tuesday were marked by violence. Stone-throwing young men clashed with police in Nairobi and other towns. Looters stormed businesses, leading shopowners to arm themselves with sticks and clubs.
Foi Wambui, a young actress who had come to protest in downtown Nairobi, said she was heading home because of the chaos.
""What has happened is that peaceful protesters are deterred from coming to town, and we are deterred from actually coming and practising our civic duties,"" she told Reuters.
DISCREDITING THE MOVEMENT
In official statements, Ruto and the government have generally distinguished between peaceful protesters and those they brand as criminals that have hijacked the demonstrations.
But their allies have seized on the violence to try to discredit the movement, popularly known as Gen Z protests for their youthful following.
Dennis Itumbi, a political consultant close to Ruto, posted a video on X of a group of young men robbing another man in the streets. It was not clear where or when the video was taken.
""Congratulations Gen-Z for your Peaceful and democratic protests along the streets,"" Itumbi wrote. ""The police should not interfere with your moves.
Gerald Bitok, the communications director at the presidency, said young people were beginning to turn against the protests.
""The Gen Zs and the young people of this country have made it crystal clear that going forward, they will not be part of the demonstrations that are now synonymous with terror,"" he said on X.
On a public forum on X on Tuesday evening that was attended by over 400,000 people, one supporter of the protest movement said it bore some responsibility for the chaos by continuing to call for demonstrations after Ruto withdrew the tax hikes.
""You are equally culpable if you are still beating the drums of war,"" he said.
Other speakers said what they referred to as paid goons were to blame, but several agreed that demonstrators should take a step back and call off Thursday's protest.
""We will have more casualties and we will not achieve what we want,"" said one. ""Let's go back. Let's strategise.""

After finishing fourth in the 2023 World Championships in Budapest Hungary, the 2019 African Games champion is confident of making it to the podium.
Gathimba who has now been training in Kasarani, Nairobi where the National Olympic Committee of Kenya has set as the residential camp will be banking on his vast experience to come on top.
“The experience I got in Rio 2016 combined with all the African championships I have won medals in will play a critical role in shaping the race I will have in Paris. I believe I have now come of age to be able to deliver in a major world event like the Olympic Games,"" said Gathimba.
Despite missing out in the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, Gathimba has managed to keep his head in the game.
He was determined to make it for the Paris 2024 edition therefore when Budapest came, he only had one goal in mind - punching his ticket and he did so clocking 1:18:34.
This was a motivation and clear indication that making the podium is indeed possible, since he came in fourth.
“I have been practicing and I feel I am not only physically prepared but also mentally to do my very best in Paris. My goal is to show Kenya and the world that walking race is just as prestigious a discipline like all the others by winning a medal in Paris,” he added.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/biden-warns-supreme-court-presidential-immunity-ruling-is-dangerous-precedent-n345013,"Biden warns Supreme Court presidential immunity ruling is 'dangerous precedent'
In clear, measured remarks from the White House, Biden said the court decision meant Trump was highly unlikely to go on trial before the Nov. 5 election for his role in seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 election, and warned it could turn U.S. presidents into kings.
The court found Trump cannot be prosecuted for any actions that were within his constitutional powers as president, but can be for private acts, in a landmark ruling recognizing for the first time any form of presidential immunity from prosecution.
""This nation was founded on the principle that there are no kings in America. Each, each of us is equal before the law. No one, no one is above the law. Not even the president of the United States,"" Biden said, reading from a teleprompter.
He said the court's decision meant there were now virtually no limits on what a president could do.
""It's a dangerous precedent, because the power of the office will no longer be constrained by the law,"" Biden said. ""The only limits will be self-imposed by the president alone.""
Biden, 81, was making his first set of remarks at the White House since his shaky debate against Trump last week led to calls for him to step aside as the Democratic Party's standard-bearer for the election.
After he stumbled over his words on the Atlanta debate stage, his remarks and comportment are being scrutinized for signs that he is up to the job of running for re-election and of governing the country for four more years.
Biden said he sided with liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who wrote she feared for U.S. democracy in her dissent in the 6-3 decision.
""Now the American people will have to do what the court should have been willing to do, but will not. The American people will render judgment on Donald Trump's tenure,"" Biden said, alluding to the November presidential election.
""I concur with Justice Sotomayor's dissent today,"" he added. ""So should the American people dissent. I dissent. May God bless you all. May God help preserve our democracy,"" Biden said in closing.
Asked on Fox News about Biden's remarks, House Speaker Mike Johnson called them ""despicable"" and ""dangerous"" and accused the president of ""trying to undermine the Supreme Court.""
Biden is running for re-election against Trump and has been sharply critical of his rival's actions related to the Jan. 6, 2021, raid on the U.S. Capitol by Trump's supporters, who believed Trump's false claims that he had won the 2020 election.
""Now the man who sent that mob to the U.S. Capitol is facing potential criminal conviction for what happened that day. The American people deserve to have an answer in the courts before the upcoming election,"" Biden said, referring to Trump being charged for his role in spurring the riot.
Biden said the public has a right to know the results of that prosecution before the election in November. ""Now, because of today's decision, that is highly, highly unlikely. It's a terrible disservice to the people in this nation.""

In a statement, DCI stated that Keter was not abducted, but rather arrested for 'Conspiracy to Traffic Firearms and Incitement to Violence'.
""Contrary to the misinformation circulating on social media on alleged abduction of Hon Alfred Keter by unknown men, this is to confirm that Hon Keter was arrested earlier today by NPS Officers for Conspiracy to Traffic Firearms and Incitement to Violence,"" the Directorate said.
DCI refuted claims on social media that Keter was arrested, stating that he was arrested by police and booked at Kamukunji Police Station.
""He was booked at Kamukunji Police Station and later released pending Forensic Analysis of exhibits. Thereafter the file will be forwarded to the ODPP for direction.""
DCI warned the public not to speculate on Keter's alleged abduction.
""Police are urging members of the public to refrain from acts of violence, hate speech and malice for sustained peace and security in our beloved country,"" DCI further said.
This comes after Keter was forced out of his car in Kileleshwa on Sunday, while his wife and children looked on in horror.
Faith Odhiambo, President of the Law Society of Kenya, later revealed that Keter had been taken to the Kamukunji Police Station.
Keter has been a vocal critic of the current government, calling for protests against Kenya's Kwanza administration.
His 'arrest' comes amid sustained abductions by percieved organisers of the recent protests against the unpopular Finance Bill 2024, which sawa protesters storm Parliament.

Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has mourned the passing of
his elder sister, Leah Wangari Muriuki.
In an emotional message on Thursday, the DP remembered his
late sister as a ‘caring mother and family Matriarch’.
The deputy president underscored that the late Wangari had
stepped up to the responsibility of a parent in looking out for the entire
Gachagua family after the death of their biological parents.
“I am saddened to receive news of the passing on of our
eldest sister Leah Wangari Muriuki. Leah has been our Mother and the family
Matriarch; she has taken good care of the larger Gachagua Family after the
death of our father and our two mothers,” he stated.
The DP went on to express his sorrow for the passing of his
sister, reiterating that it was a difficult time for him as a leader and a
family man.
“We are devastated by the loss of this family head. My deepest condolences to her husband, her children and grandchildren. This is a very difficult week for me as a national leader and a family man. May the Lord heal our Nation and families,” Gachagua noted.
The death of Wangari comes barely two years after the death of Gachagua’s only surviving brother Jack Reriani.
Reriani died on September 24, 2022, over excessive drinking while
celebrating the Kenya Kwanza victory after the 2022 polls.
“My elder brother Jackson Reriani was an alcoholic. I tried to talk to him to stop alcohol abuse and even take him to hospital but he would relapse and go back to alcohol. After we won the 2022 elections, he took alcohol to celebrate the victory. He died,” said Gachagua on March 18.
Gachagua in February 2017 lost his brother Nderitu Gachagua, who was the first governor of Nyeri County.

Residents of Theta ward, in Kiambu county, have come together and renovated a makeshift bridge that had become an eyesore in the area.
The ‘bridge’ on Ruiru had for years presented a puzzle to motorists and pedestrians. Residents told Wananchi Reporting that the makeshift bridge was further ruined by the recent heavy rains, making it impassable.
Alarmed by dangers the barrier-less ramp posed, residents mobilised institutions, groups and individuals to raise funds to fix the bridge.
According to the residents, schools, churches, PSV operators and residents raised Ksh. 472, 000 within days to help fix the bridge.
“It was unsafe to use it especially at night. At some point residents had to be literally carried across at a fee. So, we had to act fast,” Alfred Lang’at, a resident of the area, told Wananchi Reporting.
“Through our Maendeleo Whatsapp group we were able to raised enough money to rebuild the bridge and make it better and safer,” said Lang’at
The bridge connects Ngoma Tupu, Gwa Tom, Karia and Ndururumo estates in Juja with neighbouring Ruiru sub-county.
This bridge can only serve one car at a time. According to the residents, this is a temporary solution.
The old bridge was built by the community in 2016 after locals’ plea to the government to erect a bridge fell on deaf ears.

The recent deaths of several more children from malnutrition in the Gaza Strip indicate that famine has spread throughout the enclave, a group of independent human rights experts mandated by the United Nations said on Tuesday.
Gaza health authorities say at least 33 children have died of malnutrition, mostly in northern areas which had until recently faced the brunt of the Israeli military campaign launched after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel.
Since early May, the war has spread to southern Gaza, hitting aid flows into the enclave amid restrictions by Israel, which has accused U.N. agencies of failing to distribute supplies efficiently.
In Tuesday's statement, the group of 11 rights experts cited the deaths of three children aged 13, 9-years-old and six months from malnutrition in the southern area of Khan Younis and the central area of Deir Al-Balah since the end of May.
""With the death of these children from starvation despite medical treatment in central Gaza, there is no doubt that famine has spread from northern Gaza into central and southern Gaza,"" the experts said.
Their statement, signed by experts including the Special Rapporteur on the right to food, Michael Fakhri, condemned ""Israel's intentional and targeted starvation campaign against the Palestinian people"".
Israel's diplomatic mission in Geneva said the statement amounted to ""misinformation"".
""Israel has continuously scaled up its coordination and assistance in the delivery of humanitarian aid across the Gaza Strip, recently connecting its power line to the Gaza water desalination plant,"" it added.
In a Khan Younis hospital on Monday, Palestinian woman Ghaneyma Joma told Reuters she feared her son would die of starvation.
""It's distressing to see my child ... lying there dying from malnutrition because I cannot provide him with anything due to the war, the closing of crossings and the contaminated water,"" she said, seated on the floor next to her motionless son, who had an intravenous drip attached to his wrist.
Formally, whether or not a famine exists is determined by a U.N.-backed global monitor called the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), which makes an assessment based on a set of technical criteria.
Last month the IPC said Gaza remained at high risk of famine as the war continues and aid access is restricted.
More than 495,000 people across Gaza - more than one fifth of the population - are facing the most severe, or ""catastrophic"", level of food insecurity, it said, down from a forecast of 1.1 million in the previous update.

Residents in parts of Meru and Tharaka Nithi Counties are a worried lot following locust invasion in the region.
Speaking to Citizen Digital, residents said the locusts now pose as a threat to their farms.
Affected areas in Tharaka Nithi County include Mauthini, Kamacabi and Kamutuandu.
In Meru County, areas affected include Kisimani along the Tigania-Igembe border, Ndamuuru, Amwathi and adjacent semi-arid areas.
With some locals staring at an imminent invasion, efforts are ongoing to avert further crisis in the region.
At the same time, officials from both counties said they will oversee a spraying exercise starting next week to drive away the tree locusts.
Meanwhile, Meru County Chief Officer Agriculture, Livestock Development, and Fisheries James Mutia said they are aware of the situation, promising prompt action.
“Some farmers confuse desert locusts with other grasshopper species like tree locusts,” Mutia said.
Tree locusts migrate in swarms mostly at night, whereas desert locusts migrate during daytime.

Kenya Police Bullets Chief Executive
Officer Chris Oguso has said they will strategically bolster their squad with
new players as part of preparations ahead of Cecafa Women Club Championship
slated for August in Ethiopia
The law enforcers were on Wednesday crowned
the champions of the 2023/24 FKF Women’s Premier League at the Jomo Kenyatta
Mamboleo Stadium in Kisumu, following their 3-0 win over Bunyore Starlets.
They had already won the title
mathematically as early as by the time they played in round 21, but the
crowning moment was also a period of reflection of the task ahead, including
the Cecafa Championship.
“I
congratulate the girls for making history by winning the league unbeaten. Now
the league is over and the focus immediately turns to the Cecafa Women Club
Championship slated for August in Ethiopia. My task from today is to sit down
with head coach Beldine Odemba so that she can give me the list of players she
has spotted whom we can rope into our team to bolster the squad ahead of the
regional tournament.
“We already have good players who can
win us the regional title but we want to have depth in our side so that if we qualify
to the continental showpiece, we shall be having a strong side,” he noted.
Bullets finished the league with 49
points five ahead of Ulinzi Starlets who demolished Bungoma Queens 10-0 at
Ulinzi Sports Complex on the final day, while
former champions Vihiga Queens, who went down 4-1 in the hands of Wadadia,
finished third with 44 points same to Ulinzi with inferior goal difference.
Police
Bullets head coach Odemba underlined said there is a big need to bring on board new
players.
“As a coach I want to solidify all the departments
from goalkeeping up to striking. We need to add a new keeper, at least two
midfielders and one striker. The job has already kicked off, we have identified
some of them and we are continuing to scout. I hope by doing so, we will have
made strong team heading to Ethiopia for the Cecafa tournament,” said Odemba.
At the same time, Oguso who also doubles
up as the Kenya Police men team CEO, hailed the team patron Raymond Omollo (PS,
Interior) for pledging to buy the club a bus saying it will motivate the girls
to defend their title next season.
“I want to thank our Cabinet Secretary Kithure
Kindiki and his able PS Raymond Omollo for pledging to buy both the men and
women teams’ busses ahead of next season. Owning a bus as a team isn’t a small
thing, a simple modern bus costs not less than Sh. 25 million and that’s a huge,”
he noted.

News outlet CNN will cut about 100 jobs as part of a plan to consolidate news operations and bolster its digital business, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters on Wednesday.
CNN will merge its news-gathering and digital news teams, invest in video operations and launch pay-per-view news products, CNN Worldwide CEO Mark Thompson told staff in the memo.
""We are building a billion dollar+ digital business of the future,"" he said in the memo.
Thompson, a former New York Times and BBC executive who took over as CNN's CEO in October last year, is trying to streamline the network's operations and grow sales to counter falling TV viewership.
CNN will launch a standalone subscription product for CNN.com by the end of this year, the first in a series of planned subscription offerings, including one that will focus on lifestyle and feature content.
The outlet will create TV Future Lab, a unit to produce content for the Max streaming platform and package CNN's TV content for its digital channels. CNN, which is owned by Warner Bros Discovery, started streaming content on Max last year.
Thompson also detailed several changes to CNN's editorial workflows, including a centralized planning and pitching process and a new ""story manager"" role to run all aspects of a story from beginning to publication or airing.
The memo said Thompson will discuss the plan with the staff in a town hall meeting on Wednesday.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/suspected-jihadist-attack-in-mali-kills-more-than-20-civilians-n345163,"Suspected jihadist attack in Mali kills more than 20 civilians
Mali has for over a decade been ravaged by jihadists and other armed groups, with the centre of the West African country becoming a hotbed of violence since 2015.
""At least 21 civilians have been killed"" in the village of Djiguibombo, several dozen kilometres (miles) from the town of Bandiagara, an official from the provincial authority said on Wednesday.
He attributed the attack to jihadists.
Another provincial authority official and a local youth representative put the death toll at about 20.
All spoke on the condition of anonymity for security reasons or because of their positions. Since the junta came to power in 2020, information about such incidents is not generally made public.
An unknown number of people are missing.
The attack began before nightfall and ""lasted around three hours"", the youth representative said.
""Twenty people have been killed. More than half are young people. Some victims had their throats cut,"" the source added.
Others were shot dead, the main organisation representing the local Dogon ethnic group said in a statement.
The attackers looted houses, set fire to the health centre and motorbikes, and took away livestock and supplies, the organisation, Ginna Dogon, said.
The attack is ""the latest tragedy in a dark series that the Dogon country has been going through for several years, with daily attacks on villages, farmers in the fields, killings and kidnappings"", it added.
""Many inhabitants fled towards Bandiagara. Those who stayed were not even able to bury the dead properly,"" the youth representative said.
- Spiralling violence -
The deteriorated security context, remote locations and a lack of reliable information mean that attacks often take a long time to confirm.
Mali has since 2012 been plagued by different factions affiliated to Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group, as well as by self-declared self-defence forces and bandits.
The jihadist violence that started in the north spread to the centre of the country in 2015, when Katiba Macina -- an Al-Qaeda-affiliated group -- was established, led by the Fulani preacher Amadou Kouffa.
Human rights groups regularly denounce widespread impunity for attacks on civilians.
Radical Islamist groups impose pacts on local populations under which they are allowed to go about their business in return for paying a tax, accepting Islamic rules and not collaborating with the Malian army or other armed groups.
Communities are subject to retaliatory measures in the event of non-compliance.
The violence spilled over into neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger, with military regimes seizing power in all three countries.
Thousands have been killed and hundreds of thousands displaced by the violence.
Since taking power in a 2020 coup, Mali's military rulers have broken off their anti-jihadist alliance with France and European partners, while turning politically and militarily towards Russia.
The junta has enlisted the services of what it presents as Russian military instructors, but who, according to a host of experts and observers, are mercenaries from the private Russian company Wagner.
Bamako regularly claims to have gained the upper hand against the jihadists, as well as separatists in the north.

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/usa-crash-out-of-copa-in-group-phase-as-uruguay-panama-advance-n345029,"USA crash out of Copa in group phase as Uruguay, Panama advance
The United States crashed out of the Copa America on Monday
after a 1-0 defeat to Uruguay, as Panama sealed their place in the quarter-finals
with a 3-1 win over Bolivia.
The tournament hosts suffered an upset 2-1 defeat to Panama
last week and went into Monday's final Group C game at Arrowhead Stadium in
Kansas City needing to match or better Panama's result against Bolivia to
advance.
But US coach Gregg Berhalter's side never looked like doing
enough to seriously threaten a well-drilled Uruguay who advance to the last
eight as group winners.
""Just looking at the faces of the staff and the
players, we're bitterly disappointed with the results,"" Berhalter said.
""We know that we're capable of more and in this
tournament we didn't show it. It's really as simple as that. We should have
done better.
""We'll do a review and figure out what went wrong, why
it went wrong, but it's an empty feeling right now for sure.""
USA captain Christian Pulisic blamed a lack of attacking
quality.
""We had a good start and brought a lot of energy, but
just didn't have enough quality,"" he said. ""We just couldn't find a
solution.""
Hopes of a great escape for Berhalter's men faded inside the
first 30 minutes as news filtered through that Panama had taken a 1-0 lead
against Bolivia in Orlando.
US hopes were revived early in the second half after Bolivia
equalised, leaving the hosts on course for qualification, provided they
continued to hold Uruguay.
Yet the US optimism was punctured just moments later when
Uruguay took the lead in controversial circumstances through Mathias Olivera on
66 minutes.
Ronald Araujo's powerful header from Nicolas de la Cruz's
free-kick was parried away by US goalkeeper Matt Turner, but only into the path
of Olivera, who tucked away the rebound.
Replays appeared to show that Olivera was offside when
Araujo first made contact with the ball, but despite a lengthy VAR review,
Peruvian referee Kevin Ortega ruled that the goal should stand.
""It's pretty crazy,"" Berhalter said. ""I don't
understand it, I feel like I know the offside rule pretty well.
""It's disappointing. It really is. But you know that
that happens in football, and we have to live with it.""
The mathematics of qualification looked even more bleak for
the US after news that Panama had scored again through Eduardo Guerrero to
regain the lead at 2-1, and the final nail in the coffin came when Cesar Yanis
added a third for Panama in stoppage time.
The USA's first-round exit raises fresh questions about the
future of Berhalter, who remains deeply unpopular amongst swathes of American
fans.
Berhalter was only reappointed to the US job in June last
year following a hiatus after leading the team to the 2022 World Cup.
The nature of Monday's early exit is certain to reignite
debate about whether he is the best man to lead the United States into the 2026
World Cup on home soil.
Failure to defeat Uruguay, 14th in the latest FIFA rankings,
extends Berhalter's poor record against top 20 teams.
Berhalter has just five wins in 20 matches against top-20
teams during his reign, and four of those victories came against regional
rivals Mexico -- who were also eliminated from the Copa in the first round.
That dismal sequence continued after a toothless attacking
performance against Uruguay, where the US registered only three shots on goal
in a misfiring offensive display.
Defender Antonee Robinson described the officiating as
""amateur hour"" but stressed responsibility for the defeat lay with
the players.
""Just not enough quality in the final third,""
Robinson said.
""At the end of the day we weren't good enough to get
the result today. This is on us.""

https://www.citizen.digital/news/imf-urges-zimbabwe-to-tackle-corruption-for-economy-to-pick-up-n344887,"IMF urges Zimbabwe to tackle corruption for economy to pick up
The International Monetary Fund has asked
Zimbabwe to rein in corruption — said to be costing the economy billions of
dollars each year — while giving some rare praise for the country's new currency,
the most stable Zimbabwe has seen in years.
Following a recent mission to Zimbabwe, the
IMF says the country's new Zimbabwe Gold currency, or ZiG, has ended a bout of
macroeconomic instability that saw the preceding currency, the Zimbabwe dollar,
suffer radical depreciation, causing prices to skyrocket.
The IMF said that if macro-stabilization is
sustained, cumulative inflation for the remainder of the year would be about 7%
— a figure Zimbabwe has not achieved in years.
In an interview with VOA,
Persistence Gwanyanya, a member of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Board, welcomed
the IMF’s report for acknowledging that the country’s new currency had
stabilized the economy.
“We think that there has been some notable
improvements with regards to … fiscal accountability,” Gwanyanya said. “Whilst
there are isolated cases of corruption that we acknowledge, the overall picture
is that there has been significant improvement in fiscal management in the
country. And unsurprisingly, we continue to improve. But to achieve the
ambitions, we reduce the leakages, we improve … accountability further in the
economy.”
In the report, the IMF said Zimbabwe’s
economic governance still has significant weaknesses, and said corruption poses
a risk to economic performance that needs to be addressed.
Last month, Zimbabwe’s prosecutor general,
Loice Matanda-Moyo, also the former head of the anti-corruption commission,
said corruption costs the country nearly $2 billion annually, devastating the
economy and ordinary citizens.
The Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission says
it is investigating a case from last year in which the electoral commission
reportedly paid $1.2 million for a server it could have bought on the open
market for less than $25,000. The money went to a company owned by an ally of
President Emmerson Mnangagwa.
Godfrey Kanyenze, an economist and founding
director of the Labour and Economic Development Research Institute of Zimbabwe,
said reducing corruption is crucial if the country’s economy is to improve.
“Corruption is a cancer that has to be dealt
with, we need political will to address this particular issue and there is to
be a price to corrupt activities. The culture of impunity must be replaced by
zero tolerance for corruption, as is the case in other countries where the state
has played a leadership role,” Kanyenze said.
Steven Dhlamini, an economics professor at
National University of Science and Technology, said the IMF report addressed
all issues that Zimbabwe needs to get on track.
“Overall, it is a very positive report, it
confirms that our policy trajectory is on the right path and we are hopeful
that authorities are going to continue implementing these policy measures that
have been commenced since last year,” Dhlamini said.
In its report, the IMF said Zimbabwe’s economy
is showing “resilience” even as effects of the El Nino drought were being felt.
The economy is expected to grow 2 percent in 2024, down from 2023’s 5.3%.

Haitian Prime Minister Garry Conille left Port-au-Prince on Friday to travel to Washington and New York, as freshly deployed Kenyan police officers began patrolling the city as part of a U.N.-backed mission to battle armed gangs that have taken over the capital.
Conille's office said he would travel with Foreign Minister Dominique Dupuy, Finance Minister Ketleen Florestal and chief of staff Nesmy Manigat, while Justice Minister Carlos Hercule would stay as acting prime minister on his behalf.
""The delegation will have important work meetings with officials from international financial institutions, among others. It will also inspect Haiti's embassy in Washington,"" the office said, without giving further details.
A spokesperson for the U.S. National Security Council said Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer would meet with Conille on Monday.
The U.S. is the principal financial backer of a Kenya-led international security force the United Nations has ratified be sent to Haiti to help its police battle armed gangs that have plunged the country into a humanitarian crisis.
Haiti's former government first requested the force in 2022 and the a first deployment of Kenyan police arrived this week, though it is unclear when the rest of the force - expected to number over 2,500 - is set to arrive.
As armed khaki-clad Kenyan police in bullet-proof jackets and helmets patrolled the city in black armored vans, Port-au-Prince residents said they hoped the force could stop the indiscriminate killings and allow business to restart.
""We need peace. If the Kenyan police forces are here, it's so we can return to the lives we used to have. We hope they've come to work seriously,"" said resident Kloud Dine.
""We need the Kenyans here a while here because the gang members make us suffer too much,"" added Louise Baret, a painter. ""Enough is enough.""
In a video shared on social media on Wednesday, gang leader Jimmy ""Barbecue"" Cherizier rallied armed men, telling them to fire on Kenyan police and pledging to fight to the death: ""I don't care if they are white or black. If they're not Haitian and they're on Haitian soil, they're invaders,"" he said.
Over half a million people have fled their homes due to the violence and around half the population is going hungry.

Published on: July 02, 2024 05:22 (EAT)
Nearly 100 people were crushed to death at a Hindu religious gathering in northern India on Tuesday, with many others injured, a senior government official said.
A large crowd had gathered near the city of Hathras for a sermon by a popular preacher but a fierce dust storm sparked panic as people were leaving.
Many were crushed or trampled, falling on top of each other, with some collapsing into a roadside drain in the chaos.
""We have confirmed 97 deaths so far and are focusing on providing relief and medical aid for the victims,"" Chaitra V., divisional commissioner of Aligarh city in Uttar Pradesh state, told AFP.
""The attendees were exiting the venue when a dust storm blinded their vision, leading to a melee and the subsequent tragic incident,"" she said.
Most of the dead were women, according to state chief medical officer Umesh Kumar Tripathi, who told reporters ""many injured"" have been admitted to hospital.
Lines of ambulances carried the injured to hospitals.
Wailing women and crying men gathered outside one mortuary in the town of Etah, where many of the dead were taken, seeking news of their relatives.
Deadly incidents are common at places of worship during major religious festivals in India, the biggest of which prompt millions of devotees to make pilgrimages to holy sites.
""When the sermon finished, everyone started running out,"" Shakuntala, a woman who gave only one name, told the Press Trust of India news agency.
""People fell in a drain by the road. They started falling one on top of the other and got crushed to death.""
Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced compensation of $2,400 to the next of kin of those who died and $600 to those injured in the ""tragic incident"".
""My condolences are with those who have lost their loved ones... I wish for the speedy recovery of all the injured,"" Modi wrote on social media platform X.
President Droupadi Murmu said the deaths were ""heart-rending"" and offered her ""deepest condolences"".
Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath also ""expressed condolences"" to the relatives of those killed, his office said.
""He has directed the district administration officials to immediately take the injured to the hospital... and to speed up the relief work at the spot,"" it said.
Adityanath's office said an investigation had been ordered into deaths.
Religious gatherings in India have a grim track record of deadly incidents caused by poor crowd management and safety lapses.
At least 112 people were killed in 2016 after a huge explosion caused by a banned fireworks display at a temple marking the Hindu new year.
The blast ripped through concrete buildings and ignited a fire at a temple complex in Kerala state, where thousands had gathered.
Another 115 devotees were killed in 2013 in a stampede at a bridge near a temple in Madhya Pradesh.
Up to 400,000 people were gathered in the area and the stampede began after a rumour spread that the bridge was about to collapse.
In 2008, 224 pilgrims were killed and more than 400 were injured in a stampede at a hilltop temple in the northern city of Jodhpur.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/give-police-power-to-bite-charles-owino-defends-use-of-live-bullets-on-protesters-n345191,"'Give police power to bite': Charles Owino defends use of live bullets on protesters
Speaking on Citizen TV's Daybreak show on Thursday, Owino pointed out that when protests escalate into the destruction of property, especially critical infrastructure, security officers are authorized to shoot protesters.
The former police spokesperson emphasized that police are well-trained in handling protesters, with procedures varying depending on the situation.
He explained, ""Traditionally, we were trained to begin with a proclamation, asking those gathered to disperse immediately. If they refuse, then teargas is used. If they still resist, teargas and batons are employed to disperse them.""
""But now when property is being destroyed. What do you do? Those are the times you use your firearms.""
Owino responded to suggestions of using rubber bullets, stating, ""Will rubber bullets stop them? We need to face reality. We must give police power to bite. When we were being taught that if necessary, target the ringleader. If the situation is so bad, you are told, 'That tall person in the red cap,' aim and fire.""
He stressed, however, that police always strive to keep casualties to a minimum.
""Those are the procedures and it happens. So what we are saying is you limit casualties as much as possible. But this is not possible if we don't want to face the law,"" he added.
Referring to the recent intrusion of Parliament by anti-Finance Bill protestors, Owino noted that in such cases, police have no choice but to use additional force to attempt to neutralize the demonstrators.
""When individuals breach Parliament, especially targeting an armory, what else can be expected? We must adhere to the law and act within our limits to maintain order. Failure to do so will lead to anarchy,"" Owino concluded.
Owino's remarks come amid sharp criticism of the government over the killing of protestors during the ongoing anti-government protests currently in the third-week.
The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights reported on Monday that a total of 39 people have been killed in the ongoing anti-government demonstrations in Kenya.
The national rights watchdog also said there had been 32 cases of ""enforced or involuntary disappearances"" and 627 arrests of protesters.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/miners-accuse-govt-of-laxity-in-addressing-issues-affecting-industry-n345503,"Miners accuse gov't of laxity in addressing issues affecting industry
The men and women in the mining sector claim that the government has been giving empty promises.
The failure of the government to implement the mining Act 2016 has also been attributed to the challenges ailing the mining sector in the country.
Kenya Chambers of Mines executive chairperson Dr. Patrick Kanyoro, who was speaking in Migori after meeting artisanal and small scale miners said the government has not shown the good will of supporting the artisanal and small scale miners.
“We are concerned that the industry is at its lowest because the voice of the miners, the voice of the players in the industry are not being heard,” said Kanyoro.
Kanyoro said lack of proper policies guiding the mining sector in the country is among the major obstacles that need to be addressed by the Head of State.
He said a number of state organs in the mining sector are also not working in unison hence the miners are not able to get services as required.
“We have the State Department of Mining, National mining cooperation and we have the minerals right board which is all funded by taxpayers. We expect them to serve but to our disappointment, they are not. There seems to be a conflict of interest among the bodies.”
Kenya Chambers of Mines executive council chairperson said the introduction of the movement permit is also creating more problems in the mining industry and therefore they want the government to suspend the license until stakeholders are involved.
“We are suffering as an industry because there is now a movement permit introduced .In our considered opinion, a gain that is a process taken for administrative reasons without asking the players.”
The Artisanal and Small Scale Miners Association and the Kenya Council of Miners said the mining sector has potential to support the economy of the country and also employ more youth but unfortunately the opportunities have been missed because the government has not invested in the industry.
Artisanal and small scale miners’ association chairperson Mr.Dan Odida said issues of licensing for the artisanal and small scale miners remain a major obstacle in the realization of the returns from the mining sector in the country.
Odida said their members have been trying to access the mining Cadaster portal so that they can apply for the licenses as directed by the government but could not.
“We have information that bigger mining companies are given priority by the government officers,” Odida noted.
He said the challenges they have been facing indicate that the government is not committed to recognize the artisanal miners as per the Mining Act 2016.
The miners want President Ruto to have a meeting with all the miners and players in the sector so that they can deal with issues ailing the industry.

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/muranga-seal-to-sharpen-attack-next-season-after-relegation-scare-n345150,"Murang'a SEAL to sharpen attack next season after relegation scare
FKF Premier League
side Murang'a SEAL head coach Juma Abdallah says he is prioritizing bolstering
his attack ahead of the 2024/25 season.
This comes barely two
weeks after his charges escaped relegation on their debut in the just-concluded
2023/24 league.
SEAL, who were promoted
to the premier league at the end of the 2022/23 season, finished 13th with 38
points from 34 matches, just two points shy of the relegation zone.
They won 9 games, drawing
11 and losing 14, a record the veteran tactician says must be improved by
reinforcing the squad, especially at the frontline.
“Off course there are
changes that we need to effect as a team, but I am going to give priority to
the striking force. We need to start scoring goals freely as possible as soon
as the new campaign begins,” stated Abdallah.
“I am happy we are
remaining in the league, and finishing 13th in our first season in the premier
league is an achievement. For us now to do even better in the coming season, we
must sign once transfer window opens,” he added.
“I can confirm that we
have already identified six strikers from other teams.”
Under the stewardship of
Abdallah, who was appointed in January 2024, SEAL won three matches, drawing
five and losing five.
Before, the former Thika
United tactician replaced embattled Evans Nyaberi, the Murang’a-based side had
endured 11 winless matches.
He signed veteran
midfielder Dennis Odhiambo who reversed his retirement decision and installed
him as team captain. Others who joined are Yassin Sije and Robert Mudenyu, both
from AFC Leopards, and former Bandari FC player Joe Waithira, acquired on a
free transfer.
Abdallah credits the
turn-round success to the four mid-season signings, saying they brought
experience that the team needed to circumvent relegation.
“The addition of these
players strengthened our squad. Their impact was remarkable, and when we
combine with their experience in the league, we ended up changing from our poor
run and started posting positive results and eventually we remained in the league,”

A cargo truck was found with 16 men shot dead inside, while three others were found dead outside the vehicle, the ministry of public safety said in a statement, after initially giving a death toll of 20.
The events occurred Friday in the municipality of La Concordia, near the border with Guatemala, where violence has been on the rise in recent years.
An initial investigation said the clash was between the Sinaloa cartel, one of the most powerful in Mexico, and another gang identified as the ""Chiapas and Guatemala"" cartel.
The ministry said in a statement that the two groups were battling over ""criminal control of the border area.""
The region is key for the trafficking of drugs, arms and migrants toward the United States, according to the non-governmental organization Insight Crime.
The Mexican government deployed an additional 1,200 personnel to reinforce the country's southern border with Guatemala.
In that part of Mexico, another cartel in a turf war with the Sinaloa outfit -- Jalisco Nueva Generacion -- is known to be operating.
Violence has escalated in recent years in Chiapas state.
During the country's presidential campaign, Claudia Sheinbaum -- who was elected in June and will take over from Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in October -- was briefly detained by hooded men who stopped her vehicle. She was unhurt in the incident.
Voting was suspended in two municipalities in Chiapas state due to a spike in violence that prevented polling booths from being set up, officials said.
Spiraling criminal violence has seen more than 450,000 people murdered in Mexico since the government of then-president Felipe Calderon launched a military offensive against drug cartels in 2006.

Inter Milan will begin the defence of their Serie A title at Genoa while ambitious Como take on Juventus in their first top flight fixture in over two decades, after the 2024/25 season fixture list was announced on Thursday.
Simone Inzaghi's Inter strolled to last season's Scudetto and will try to retain their crown under new ownership after US investment fund Oaktree acquired the club in May.
Oaktree assumed ownership of Inter days after they were officially crowned Italian champions, as previous owners Suning missed a deadline to repay a three-year loan which matured at 395 million euros ($428 million).
Sporting CEO Giuseppe Marotta, who had been hired by Chinese conglomerate Suning in 2018 and is considered the architect of Inter's recent successes, was appointed president last month.
After their opening fixture at Genoa, which is scheduled for August 18, Inter face Lecce and Europa League holders Atalanta at home before travelling to Monza and then facing local rivals AC Milan in the fifth round of matches in September.
Como have a blockbuster beginning to their first Serie A season in 21 years at Juve, who hired Thiago Motta as their new coach last month after sacking Massimiliano Allegri.
Bankrolled by Indonesian tobacco giants Djarum, Como have stormed through the divisions since being acquired in 2019 following multiple bankruptcies.
From the world-famous lakeside city in northern Italy, Como have former Arsenal teammates Cesc Fabregas and Thierry Henry as minority shareholders.
Fabregas is also assistant to first team coach Osian Roberts.
Como will play their first three fixtures -- against Juve, Cagliari and Udinese -- away from home to help the club complete works on its Giuseppe Sinigaglia stadium which currently does not meet Serie A's requirements.
Their first home match is against Bologna, who will be one of Italy's five clubs in the revamped Champions League, in mid-September.
Atalanta will also play their first three matches away from the Gewiss Stadium whose redevelopment is nearing completion.
Fellow promoted teams Parma and Venezia will face Fiorentina and Lazio respectively on the opening day of the campaign.
Matches in the coming season, which finishes on May 25, will generally be spread across each weekend, with one match on Friday night, three on Saturday, five on Sunday and the final fixture on Monday night.
Only two matches will be played at the traditional time of 3pm on a Sunday afternoon.
The first three rounds of matches, in August and early September, will all be played in the evening to avoid the worst of the summer heat.

The community commended the youth, particularly Gen Z, for their determination to have their voices heard in matters of governance.
""Their push is not in vain, and we believe they are being listened to,"" the statement read.
However, the community highlighted the severe impact of violence and looting that marred the protests against the rejected Finance Bill 2024. ""We are suffering in many ways after goons infiltrated the recent protests and looted our property,"" the statement continued.
While the President estimated the damages at Ksh.2.4 billion, the community corrected the figure upwards to Ksh.3 billion, citing significant business disruptions and potential job losses.
The Nairobi Youth Business Community revealed they possess images and CCTV footage of individuals believed to have exploited the peaceful protests for looting. They expressed their readiness to share this evidence with authorities and urged the police to take swift action to bring the perpetrators to justice.
In a call for calm and unity, the community appealed to politicians to reduce the heightened political tensions for the sake of national stability and progress. ""This is our country. Let everyone do their work professionally without interference,"" the statement concluded.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/fresh-audit-report-reveals-attorney-generals-legal-advice-on-loans-was-ignored-n345622,"Fresh audit report reveals Attorney General’s legal advice on loans was ignored
A report by the Auditor General has revealed
that the National Treasury may not have the capacity to process the procurement
of external loans effectively.
At
a time that the country is reeling under the burden of more than Ksh.5 trillion
in external public debt, the auditor’s report shows that the government may have
ignored advice from the Attorney General on several occasions, while also
signing up for loans way before concepts of the intended projects were
developed.
The
report dated October 2023 covering three financial years between 2019 and 2022
shows up to Ksh.5.3 billion of commitment fees were incurred on loans that had
not been disbursed, meaning the country incurred expenditure that could have
been avoided had the right procedure been followed.
The
report shows that there were delays in the commencement of projects, delayed
drawings and even stalled projects reported, all pointing to inadequacies of
the government.
The
auditor found that the process of procuring loans was flawed and that approvals
were secured without proper planning and preparedness.
It
shows that, out of six sampled projects, there had been no public participation
conducted before identification and even approval of the projects.
It also states that financiers approached
ministries directly, most way before projects were conceptualized. Financiers
or would-be creditors identified target projects based on strategic plans of
ministries.
Ordinarily,
once a project has been identified, a feasibility study is done and the costing
estimated, then the government seeks the financing after analysing various
options.
The
Auditor General however identified gaps in how the National Treasury compared
credit terms. In most of the loans, there was only one creditor identified without
considering other potential creditors for the purpose of comparing credit terms
and conditions.
The
auditor found that in some of the instances, comparative analysis of creditors
was limited as a creditor would have been identified by the time of a project
proposal submission, saying in some of the cases, the potential creditor had
financed the feasibility study.
The report went ahead to establish that
contracted loans may not have been the most cost-effective in the market.
The
auditor identified gaps in the evaluation of credit terms including currency,
penalty fees, and other charges on the loans.
That
disbursement and maturity profiles and their impact on existing debt service
profiles were not performed. The report shows that the National Treasury’s debt,
policy, strategy and risk management office is inadequate in necessary staff
and skills.
Further,
in four out of six sampled loans, the legal advice of the Attorney General was
not followed.
As a result, some of the projects stalled for
failing to adhere to the pre-conditions for loans. They include the
Kenol-Sagana-Marua Highway, and the Bagamoyo-Horohoro-Lunga Lunga-Malindi road
projects.
The
report comes at a time when the President has picked a task force to conduct a forensic audit of the public debt.
The
Auditor General indicates that the public debt management office at the
National Treasury did not monitor project implementation, partly for lack of
capacity and that it relies on implementing agencies, meaning there could be
material facts that only the Treasury could pick.
According to
the Central Bank of Kenya, Kenya’s public debt stood at Ksh.10.3 trillion in
March 2024. Of that, Ksh.5.16 trillion is foreign debt, both bilateral and
multilateral.

https://www.citizen.digital/opinion-blogs/opinion-rethinking-the-healthcare-model-shifting-the-paradigm-from-curative-to-preventive-healthcare-n345106,"OPINION: Rethinking the healthcare model - Shifting the paradigm from curative to preventive healthcare
In recent years, preventive healthcare has gained significant interest among individuals and healthcare stakeholders, including insurance companies.
With this emerging trend, we must appreciate the profound connection between preventative care and the sustainability of healthcare systems.
As we look ahead, it is crucial to reimagine healthcare models that not only treat illnesses but also prioritize proactive measures to maintain health and well-being. The benefits of preventive healthcare cannot be undervalued.
By focusing on early detection, lifestyle changes, and vaccinations, preventive care has the potential to reduce the burden of chronic diseases, improve quality of life, and lower healthcare costs over the long term.
Additionally, investing in preventive measures fosters a healthier population, which in turn supports a more productive workforce and contributes to overall societal well-being.
This healthcare framework not only benefits individuals by promoting healthier lifestyles and reducing disease risks but also plays a pivotal role in enhancing the financial sustainability of insurance companies and the broader healthcare system.
By reducing the need for costly treatments and hospitalizations, insurers can allocate resources more efficiently, while healthcare systems can achieve greater efficiency and resilience.
Despite its benefits, preventive healthcare faces several challenges. Systemically, there is often an absence of policies advocating for preventive measures. The recently developed Primary Healthcare Act offers a promising solution.
Industry-specific challenges include a lack of rigorous data analytics to support preventive health interventions and difficulties in sharing medical data across health systems. On an individual level, competing interests and the macroeconomic environment can hinder the adoption of preventive practices.
To overcome these challenges, insurers and other industry stakeholders must take actionable steps to mainstream preventive healthcare. The adoption and implementation of a primary healthcare model in the private insurance sector can augment governmental efforts.
Rational data sharing of surveillance reports across the industry is essential, as is the development of products that promote health and appeal to the health-conscious. Reviewing policies that hinder preventive health efforts, such as certain exclusions, and including behavioural science models in preventive health solutions are also crucial steps.
Investment in technology and innovations will also play a key role in supporting preventive healthcare. Telehealth services, at-home testing kits, and pharmacy point-of-care portals can improve and encourage access to quality care.
Innovations that enhance personal health monitoring, such as wearable health devices and smartwatches, are useful in promoting healthy lifestyles.
Personalizing care through tailored recommendations based on a person’s interests, health risks, goals, and medical history can significantly enhance preventive health initiatives.
Applications that interact with patients, nudge them towards healthier behaviours, and send targeted messaging will also improve engagement and uptake of preventive health measures.
In the long run, a preventive healthcare model can drastically improve health outcomes. By reducing the incidence of serious illnesses through early detection and lifestyle interventions, the frequency and cost of care can be minimized.
This not only benefits underwriters but also enhances the overall experience for policyholders, leading to higher satisfaction and loyalty.
Shifting from a curative to a preventive healthcare model is essential for the future of the industry. By investing in preventive measures, leveraging technology, and overcoming systemic and industry-specific challenges, we can create a sustainable, profitable, and health-focused insurance landscape.
The time to rethink our healthcare model is now, and the benefits of preventive healthcare are too significant to ignore. Let's embrace this paradigm shift for a healthier tomorrow.

The Office of the Director of Public
Prosecutions (ODPP) has refuted claims by Nairobi Senator Edwin Sifuna that
former Migori Governor Okoth Obado’s graft case was withdrawn after an out-of-court settlement with the State agency.
Sifuna, during a Wednesday Senate session,
had expressed shock that “a plea bargain had been entered between the ODPP and
the Governor who had stolen billions of shillings who then agreed to return
Ksh.300 million and the case was subsequently withdrawn.""
The
ODPP, in a statement released on Wednesday, rubbished Sifuna’s utterances
saying the case against the ex-Migori Governor was still in process and was set
for hearing later this month.
The
ODPP clarified that the cases that
were withdrawn against Obado and 15 co-accused persons were the Asset
Recovery Civil cases filed by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC).
“The
ODPP has noted reports alleging it entered a plea-bargain agreement with the
accused persons and after settlement, withdrew the charges against the accused
persons. Do note the cases that have been withdrawn are the Asset Recovery
Civil cases filed by EACC,” the ODPP stated.
“The
Criminal Case (No. ACC.E018 of 2020) involving the accused persons being
prosecuted by the ODPP has not been withdrawn and is scheduled for further
hearing on July 8 and 9 2024, before Milimani Anti-Corruption Court No.2.”
This
comes after the court last month announced that it had closed a Ksh.1.9 billion asset case against
Obado, his children and others.
The
court was told that Obado and EACC settled the matter out of court with a
Ksh.235 million agreement.
The High
Court had earlier allowed the commission to seize assets worth Ksh.235 million believed
to have been fraudulently acquired through proceeds of corruption, which
included his residential houses and three high-end cars.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/tone-deaf-are-kenyas-protests-and-its-president-at-a-crossroads-n345151,"'Tone deaf': Are Kenya's protests, and its president, at a crossroads?
Published on: July 03, 2024 05:55 (EAT)
A protester reacts as a tear gas canister explodes on him during an anti-government demonstration called following nationwide deadly protests over tax hikes and a controversial now-withdrawn tax bill in downtown Nairobi, on July 2, 2024. Kenyan police fired tear gas to scatter small crowds in the capital Nairobi on Tuesday, AFP reporters saw, after youth activists called for fresh protests following deadly violence during anti-tax hike demonstrations last month.
Kenya has seen peaceful marches mostly led by Gen-Z youth against now-scrapped tax hikes descend into violence, with dozens killed in clashes with police as protesters accuse ""goons"" of hijacking demonstrations.
What does this mean for the movement, and what next for President William Ruto?
- What happened? -
Protests broke out two weeks ago, sparked by proposed tax hikes included in the annual finance bill, and took Ruto's government by surprise.
Initially peaceful and organised on social media, the protests spiralled into violence in the capital Nairobi and elsewhere, with demonstrators ransacking the partly ablaze parliament complex and police firing live rounds at crowds last week.
At least 39 people have died, according to rights groups.
A planned march on Tuesday again descended into violence, with the police later announcing the arrests of nearly 300 people for ""engaging in criminal activities in the guise of protesting"".
- How has the president reacted? -
Following last week's unprecedented scenes showing parliament in chaos and partially on fire, Ruto pulled the finance bill and called for dialogue with the protesters.
But he also likened some of the demonstrators to ""criminals"", while praising the police for having ""done the best they could"", further inflaming the situation, analysts said.
""There is a general feeling that Ruto is tone deaf to both public concern and the magnitude of this crisis,"" Declan Galvin, managing director of Exigent Risk Advisory, told AFP.
""Without a change in course in the coming days, Ruto's spectacular rise and political career could be derailed.""
- Are the protests still going? -
It's complicated.
Many prominent demonstrators are sharing posters for fresh peaceful rallies and calling for Ruto to resign.
But the situation on the ground is another story.
On Tuesday, what were billed as peaceful marches degenerated into running battles between stone-throwing young men and tear gas-firing cops. There were also multiple instances of looting in Nairobi and the port city of Mombasa.
As images of the chaos hit Kenyan TV channels, one prominent protester said the rallies had been infiltrated by ""goons"".
Another rally is planned for Thursday but some demonstrators told AFP on Wednesday that they were confused about what was happening and were not sure if they would hit the streets again -- with one suggesting the movement might migrate entirely online.
- Surely this is good news for Ruto? -
Not really.
The protests have tapped into long-running issues that Kenya is grappling with, say analysts.
Chiefly sparked by a cost-of-living crisis and corruption, public anger then shifted to the heavy-handed police response.
And late Tuesday, when news broke of MPs poised to receive an annual salary hike, it added yet another dimension to the movement.
""The protest movement across Kenya is evolving from social and economic grievances associated with the Finance Bill into something more anti-government,"" Galvin noted.
- What can Ruto do? -
Galvin said the Kenyan leader could de-escalate the situation by organising a cabinet reshuffle, while announcing tax cuts in line with demonstrators' demands.
But Gabrielle Lynch, professor of comparative politics at the University of Warwick, said Ruto -- a political outsider with a profound sense of faith -- has a history of succeeding despite adversity.
""There's a sense that God has willed it, and he should be there,"" she told AFP.
""It doesn't look like he'll change how he's behaving... he seems to think that he'll weather the storm, and he'll see this decline in the protests as evidence of that.""
- What happens next? -
People are waiting to see what happens on Thursday.
Even if fewer people show up, Lynch said the strength of the movement should not be underestimated.
""I think it is a signal of deep-seated issues that are going to come back and again and again,"" she said, suggesting it was also building on last year's opposition protests against the previous finance bill.
""They might go away for a few months or even a year, but that won't mean that popular anger and a sense of empowerment will have gone.""
Galvin agreed and also pointed towards the upcoming Saba-Saba protest on Sunday, an annual march on July 7 in memory of the 1990s movement calling for multi-party democracy.
""There is no end in sight,"" he said.

Former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
has attributed the ongoing anti-government protests across Kenya to the anger
and frustration of the youth due to poor governance.
Speaking
on Citizen TV’s ‘JKLive’ show on Wednesday, Obasanjo opined that youths in
Kenya and the entire African continent are grappling with similar problems,
among them lack of jobs and poverty which have led to hopelessness for the
majority.
He
warned of a looming revolution if leaders do not heed to the needs of the
youth, comparing the situation to a ticking time bomb.
“They
are unemployed, underpowered and see nothing other than hopelessness. In a
situation like that, what you have from frustrated youth is anger and they have
no hope. If you want to kill any human being, take hope and cut away his life,
that is what is happening,” said Obasanjo.
“All
of Africa, we are all sitting on the keg of gunpowder because of the youth, and
there is virtually no excuse in Africa why the youth are not angry.”
Citing
a phrase he coined during a past visit to Kenya in 2011, ‘From the Arab spring
there will be an African winter,’ the renowned African peace ambassador said
that the continent is staring at a similar scene of youth revolution.
“If
no adequate attention is paid to the needs of the youth in Africa, the autumn
will turn to winter and it will be very ugly for all of us,” he stated.
Obasanjo
went on to point out that most youths are also angered by the opulence of the
leaders despite the hard economic times.
“If you have
nothing to gain, you are jobless, you are not empowered, you are in poverty and
then you see your leaders, some of them in obscene affluence, then what do you
do?” Posed Obasanjo.

Retiring Germany midfielder Toni Kroos said he was optimistic for the team's future despite their ""bitter"" Euro 2024 exit after a 2-1 quarter-final loss to Spain in extra time on Friday.
Kroos came out of international retirement for one last dance with Germany at the Euros, playing a crucial role as the home side impressed after almost a decade of poor performances at major tournaments.
He had previously announced he would retire from all football after the tournament.
After a goalless first half, Spain took the lead when Dani Olmo swept in a pass from 16-year-old winger Lamine Yamal.
Germany hit back in the 89th minute when Florian Wirtz equalised, sending the game to extra time.
Germany had a penalty appeal for handball turned down before Spain's Mikel Merino headed in the winner in the 119th minute.
""We threw everything in, to lose when we were so close, is bitter,"" Kroos told ARD.
""The elimination is the main focus right now (rather than his retirement), because the goal that we had we were unable to achieve and the dream we had is over.
""We played a good tournament but when you're so close, to be eliminated like that, it's bitter.""
The 34-year-old insisted the future was bright for German football and said the side had brought optimism back to the fans and supporters.
""We can all be proud because of what we did. I was happy to help out, I think we gave German football hope again and we got better as we went along.
""I think the team will do it in future, but today we're extremely sad because we would have liked to stay a little longer.""
Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann, who was instrumental in convincing Kroos to come out of international retirement in time for the Euros, praised the departing veteran.
""It's impossible to over-appreciate Toni's career. He's been a unique player for Germany. He's one of Germany's biggest players,"" said the 36-year-old.
Nagelsmann said Kroos spoke to the players in the dressing room after the loss, saying ""he will always see himself as part of this group"".
""Everyone knows about his successes but not everyone knows his character. He spoke to the team in what was a very difficult moment for him personally.""

England manager Gareth Southgate said the Three Lions are sensing their shot at history in Wednesday's Euro 2024 semi-final against a Netherlands side hitting their stride in Dortmund.
Southgate's men are aiming to reach the final of a major tournament on foreign soil for the first time and take a step closer to ending a 58-year wait to win a major tournament.
The winners will face Spain in Berlin on Sunday after they came from behind to beat France 2-1 on Tuesday.
England missed out in heartbreaking fashion in the final of Euro 2020, losing on penalties at Wembley to Italy.
Captain Harry Kane said reaching back-to-back finals would be an ""amazing achievement"" as he aims to win a first major trophy of his career.
But Kane has been singled out for criticism back home for his sluggish displays in Germany, where he now plays his club football for Bayern Munich.
The 30-year-old has scored two of England's five goals at the tournament but has looked physically restricted after missing the end of the club season with a back injury.
Kane's lacklustre performances have been symptomatic of England's struggles as a team.
Twice they have stared down a humiliating early exit only to fight back against Slovakia and Switzerland thanks to individual moments of magic from Jude Bellingham and Bukayo Saka.
England arrived in Germany as one of the favourites thanks to a richly-talented squad and an upturn in their fortunes under Southgate.
And he believes his players struggled to cope with that expectation early in the tournament.
""One of our strengths over the last eight years has been less fear, less inhibition but at the beginning the expectation weighed heavily,"" said Southgate at his pre-match press conference on Tuesday.
""Now we are into that moment in the tournament where it is what is possible? What is achievable? Rather than, what could go wrong?
""That is different for a player. This is now the chance to make history, first time to make a final not held in England.""
The selection of referee Felix Zwayer has raised eyebrows after Bellingham was fined during his time at Borussia Dortmund for bringing up a historic charge of match fixing against the German.
Zwayer was handed a six-month ban in 2006 after he was investigated for taking a bribe from another official.
Bellingham was fined 40,000 euros ($43,000) for his outburst after Bayern Munich beat Dortmund in December 2021.
- Dutch face travel chaos -
The Netherlands also had their troubles in the group stages as a 3-2 defeat to Austria saw them sneak through as one of the best third-placed sides.
Ronald Koeman's men have since found their groove in a 3-0 win over Romania in the last 16 before battling back to beat Turkey 2-1 in the last eight.
The Dutch boast one of the form attacking players in the tournament in Cody Gakpo, who is looking to move out in front in the race for the Golden Boot by adding to his three goals so far.
They have had to wait 36 years since their own sole major tournament triumph -- which came the last time the Euros were held in Germany.
But their preparations for the game were disrupted by issues with the German train system, which has caused chaos for fans throughout the tournament.
The Netherlands had planned to go from their base in Wolfsburg by rail to Dortmund.
However, a blockage on the line meant a last-minute change of plans as they instead had to fly and missed their pre-match media duties as a result.
""We don't play until 9 pm (1900GMT) tomorrow. I'm sure they will still get dinner when they arrive,"" added Southgate.
""They've got plenty of time. I don't see it having any impact on the game.""

Declan Rice is taking England's Euro 2024
semi-final against the Netherlands in his stride and believes they have the
momentum to beat the Dutch and win their first-ever European Championship.
The Arsenal midfielder, the bedrock for England
during what has been a lacklustre run to
the last four, said he was in relaxed mood ahead of Wednesday's clash in Dortmund, while expecting a tough game.
""It's business as usual ... I don't put too
much pressure on myself, I don't think about it too much,"" Rice told
England's Lions' Den programme.
""It's another game of football, it's a
semi-final and that's the only way I think about it.""
""We're here for a reason, Holland are here for
a reason and may the best team win. It's a game of football, we feel like we've
got a really good bit of momentum on our side,"" he added.
The statistics underline Rice's contribution for
England, covering more distance in the tournament than any other player at
63.9km (39.7 miles) over five matches, with the fourth most tackles and balls
recovered.
""This is our job, this is what we're
conditioned for, 90-minute football matches,"" he said.
""The bigger the games, the more driven I get
and I just get extra spurts of energy ... they say I run too much but it's just
a part of me, I love trying to help my teammates and I love winning the ball
back.""
Victory in Dortmund would send England into their
second successive Euros final and their third major final overall.
Rice believes England can go all the way and urged
fans to keep backing the team ahead of what he called a massive game against
the Netherlands, for a chance to meet Spain or
France.
""We've got a lot of respect for them. If you
look at the history of the Dutch, the players they've produced, the managers
... they've always been the top nation. I'm never going to sit here and talk
them down,"" Rice said.
""We're really confident. Keep backing us, keep
supporting us because we're feeling that love, that energy. Hopefully, we can
create history again by going back-to-back finals.""

The National Elders Council has expressed its
support for the ongoing Gen Z-led protests in the country, while faulting the
government for failing to meet the needs of its citizens.
Speaking at a press conference in Nairobi on

conduct a forensic audit following the debt crisis in the country.
""When the Kenya Kwanza government
assumed office, they claimed there were empty coffers and no money. We demand a
thorough audit of government expenditure and revenue over the last 15 years,""

announced by Treasury Cabinet Secretary Prof. Njuguna Ndung'u during the budget

""Corruption in this country is the root
cause of unemployment. The youth are on the streets because they lack jobs.

With a global Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) market size projected to reach $43 billion by next year, the Elevate Africa UAS Summit 2024, brought together local and international industry players, next-generation drone pilots, and enthusiasts to discuss the future trajectory of UAS technology across the continent.
This landmark event, which is the first of an annual series, was organized by Kenya Flying Labs, Africa Drone Forum and Pravesh Global in partnership with KONZA Technopolis and the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA), to showcase Africa's immense potential in UAS technology.
With 500+ participants from 21 countries, including Uganda, Rwanda, South Africa, and Nigeria, the summit highlighted the continent's diverse and dynamic drone landscape.
Key discussions explored the transformative potential of drones in sectors such as agriculture, healthcare, and logistics. Prominent speakers, including figures from the KCAA, industry experts, and government officials who shared their insights on drone regulation and technology in Africa.
A phenomenal highlight of the Summit was the Women in Drones panel, which championed equity and inclusivity, addressing gender disparities and emphasizing the critical role of women in advancing drone technology across Africa.
On Day 2 at Konza Technopolis, over 150 students from Kenyatta University, Alliance High School, and East Africa School of Aviation participated in the 'Drone Zone' hands-on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) workshop.
These enthusiastic and insightful youth attendees, who represented the future workforce, brought unique energy to the conference, as they proactively engaged industry with meaningful questions about drone-operations.
Director, KCAA Air Navigation Services, Anne Gitau, speaking on behalf of the Director General of Civil Aviation Authority, said, “Kenya has positioned itself as a leader in the drone ecosystem and KCAA has played a crucial role in implementing regulatory framework ensuring safety and regulatory compliance to be an enabler, not an impediment, dedicated to supporting the growth of the drone industry.
“Globally the UAS market is projected to grow exponentially, with estimates suggesting that it could reach a market size of $43 billion by 2025. Africa is poised to be a vital player in this growth and Kenya in particular is at the forefront of embracing these new technologies,” said Gitau.
Chief Guest Senator Tabitha Munene highlighted the success stories emerging from Kenya’s drone ecosystem, “From delivering medical supplies in remote areas to enhancing agricultural productivity, drones are significantly impacting our society. The government’s National Drones Strategy provides a clear roadmap for integrating drone technology across various sectors and supports drone startups and research initiatives, focusing on empowering youth and women.”
The summit also addressed the impact of drones on wildlife protection and revolutionized mapping and surveying, enhancing accuracy and efficiency in geospatial data collection. In agriculture, drones are innovating precision farming, increasing yields, and reducing costs. According to Mr Cleopa Otieno, CEO Kenya Flying Labs, “Drones equipped with advanced sensors have proved to be innovative tools in disaster management and response providing aerial advantage to conduct rapid aerial surveys capturing real-time imagery to assess for first response and situational awareness.”
Eno Umoh, Chairman of the African Drone Forum, emphasized the event's significance. “The African Drone Forum is the largest network of drone professionals on the continent. This summit demonstrates that Africa’s drone ecosystems are empowered and innovative, creating opportunities for the next generation. Notable examples of drone impact in Africa include Rwanda’s reduced delivery times for medical supplies and Ghana’s use of drones to monitor cocoa plantations. ”
As a leading technology hub, Konza Technopolis played a pivotal role in partnering with Elevate Africa UAS Summit by hosting live drone flying demos that showcased the innovative capabilities of modern drones and their practical applications.
John Paul Okwiri, CEO of Konza Technopolis, affirmed Konza’s dedication to innovation in the drone sector. “Konza Technopolis is excited to lead this technological revolution, driving initiatives like the development of a drone corridor licensed by KCAA. This event underscores our commitment to creating a smarter, more connected future through innovative technology solutions.”
In her remarks, Aviation professional and Elevate Africa UAS Summit Ambassador, Captain Mercy Makau encouraged collective vision and commitment to drive positive change. ""As an aviator with a passion for mobilizing youth towards innovation in aviation, I believe our collective vision and commitment to positive change will elevate Africa. By harnessing the power of drones, we can create a brighter, sustainable future. 'Flying Forward Together,' we can achieve extraordinary outcomes.""
The 2024 Elevate Africa UAS Summit was made possible by sponsors and exhibitors such as German Drones, Wild Drones, StableGen, Botlab Dynamics, Airbound, Geminia Insurance, WeRobotics, iPay Africa, Fahari Aviation, and Kenya Red Cross.
Despite uncertainty in the city center due to the Kenya Finance Bill protests, the resilience of the attendees was remarkable, with official numbers reaching over 500.
""In conclusion, the Summit highlighted Kenya's leadership in the drone industry and recognized its efforts in driving innovation, diversity, and entrepreneurship across the continent. To join the growing African drone community and learn more about drone technology and career opportunities in Kenya, visit the Africa Drone Forum or Kenya Flying Labs,"" said conference organizer, Pavan Ananth, Founder & CEO, Pravesh Global.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/hurricane-beryl-churns-towards-jamaica-bringing-floods-at-least-two-reported-killed-n345070,"Hurricane Beryl churns towards Jamaica, bringing floods; at least two reported killed
The storm made landfall on Monday on Carriacou island, part of Grenada, where one person was killed, the BBC reported, and power was cut island-wide.
Another person was reportedly killed in St Vincent, though Reuters could not immediately verify either fatality.
Beryl is expected to bring 4 to 12 inches of rainfall to Jamaica on Wednesday, possibly triggering flash floods, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.
As of 1200 GMT, Beryl, packing winds of up to 165 miles per hour (250 kilometres per hour), was about 625 miles (1,006 km) east-south east of Kingston, Jamaica's capital, it said.
The unusually early timing and rapid intensification of the storm, the first in this year's Atlantic hurricane season, is partly due to warmer ocean temperatures, scientists say.
Jamaica issued a hurricane warning on Monday, while tropical storm warnings were in effect for parts of the southern coasts of the Dominican Republic and Haiti.
The ""potentially catastrophic"" storm struck the Caribbean region earlier in the day as a Category 4 storm and was expected to bring life-threatening winds and a storm surge to Jamaica.
While it has picked up to a 5 on a five-point scale, it was expected to become less intense later in the day, NHC said.
The storm's center ""will move quickly across the southeastern and central Caribbean Sea today and is forecast to pass near Jamaica on Wednesday and the Cayman Islands on Thursday,"" the weather agency said.
Across other islands in the eastern Caribbean, residents had boarded up windows, stocked up on food and fueled up cars ahead of the storm.
Dozens of vessels in the storm's path risk being affected, with diversions seen in the Caribbean, according to Vortexa, which provides energy-cargo tracking data.
Officials in Mexico have also begun to prepare for Beryl's arrival later this week, with the federal government urging authorities and citizens to show ""extreme caution"".

England striker Ollie Watkins said he ""manifested"" his last-gasp winner against the Netherlands which powered his team into the Euro 2024 final on Wednesday.
The Aston Villa striker came on in the final stages in Dortmund and clinically slotted home the decisive goal in England's 2-1 win.
Watkins was teed up by another substitute, Chelsea's Cole Palmer, who also came on with him in the 81st minute.
""I said to Cole that we were both going to go on the pitch and he was going to set me up, at half-time,"" Watkins told reporters.
""It happened, I manifested it and as soon as he turned I knew I needed to make a move. You don't get that opportunity very often so I had to be greedy, I had to take it.
""After seeing it go into the bottom corner I don't think I've hit a ball that sweetly before. Obviously it's such a special moment.""
Having been left out of all of England's matches at the tournament except for a 20-minute appearance against Denmark off the bench, Watkins said he had been getting itchy feet.
""To be honest, recently I got a little bit frustrated -- I don't like to be on the bench, I've had the best season of my career,"" he explained.
""The amount of people that have messaged me today saying I'm going to score tonight when I come on is ridiculous.
""Obviously they've put it out into the universe, hopefully they can do the same for the final or even give me the lottery numbers.""
Watkins' dramatic goal was only the fourth of his international career and second in a competitive game, having netted the other against San Marino on his debut in March 2021.
The forward, in his first major tournament for England, described his joy at finding the net.
""When you score there's emotions that come through your body but this is just a different feeling,"" said Watkins.
""It was slow motion when I was running over to the boys and celebrating... I didn't want to get off the pitch at the end because I just wanted to soak it all in, it doesn't happen often obviously.""
England face joint-record three-time Euros winners Spain in Sunday's final in Berlin, having finished as runners-up to Italy in the 2020 final.
""Spain are a great footballing team, so many good players, a lot of squad depth like ourselves, experience... it's the most important game of our lives,"" added Watkins.

""Our aim is to work with partners not sponsored because I believe as partners we can walk far but sponsorship ends easily some partners will be with us till the 2032 games. We have also partnered with Safaricom to offer financial literacy to the athletes. Already we have offered all athletes who will take part in the Olympics with KSh30,000 worth of airtime.
We are also engaging the government to see if the allowance can be added but as for now we are following the SRC recommend allowances.""

Spain defender Marc Cucurella believes the key to stopping France striker Kylian Mbappe in their Euro 2024 semi-final clash is a unified approach.
Joint record three-time winners Spain face France in Munich on Tuesday after ousting hosts Germany in extra-time.
Explosive new Real Madrid signing Mbappe has struggled at the Euros after breaking his nose in France's first match, scoring once from the penalty spot, but remains Les Bleus' main attacking threat.
""I think football is a collective sport, and it's true that if it was one-on-one it would be tricky, but it's up to us in the end,"" Cucurella told a news conference Sunday.
""Apart from being good with the ball, we are a very hard-working team, we give everything for each other, and I think that's the key.
""We have to be united, to know what to do in each moment, and above all we need to minimise their counter-attacks which are prehaps their strongest weapons.""
Cucurella has been one of the most impressive players in Spain's side this summer, a surprise to some after an inconsistent season with Chelsea.
The left-back had only appeared once for his country before this year, but improving performances at Stamford Bridge in the final months of the season and Valencia defender Jose Gaya's injury helped him claim a starting spot.
With defender Dani Carvajal suspended against France after a red card in extra-time in the 2-1 win over Germany, the 25-year-old could be used at right-back, where he operated for Chelsea on occasion.
""I'll try to give my best, to contribute my grain of sand,"" said Cucurella.
""I feel more comfortable on the left but in the end I have to try to do the best I can and help the team.
""What's important is that we win, and it doesn't matter who plays, if on Sunday we are in the final.""
- 'These things happen' -
The defender was involved in a controversial moment against Germany where the ball struck his hand in the area but the hosts were not awarded a penalty.
""If the referees said it wasn't a penalty, then I will respect that,"" said Cucurella.
""In the end these are things that happen, they are decisions... (Germany's Toni) Kroos could have been booked before and then sent off.
""Football is a game of errors and accuracies, in the end we were more accurate than them, we scored one goal more and we got through.""
Kroos hacked down Barcelona's Pedri in the early stages and the midfielder was substituted and will miss the rest of the tournament with a knee ligament sprain.
The former Real Madrid star wished Pedri a speedy recovery in an open letter to Germany fans after his retirement from football, and the Spaniard replied on Sunday.
""I came to Germany for Euro 2024 and here I will stay, until the end, because don't doubt it, the dream continues,"" wrote Pedri on social media platform X.
""Thanks Toni Kroos, for your message, this is football and these things happen. Your career and your achievements will always remain.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy attended the European Union summit in Brussels Thursday, where he thanked EU members for a long-term security agreement they were expected to sign and urged delivery of promised packages of military aid.
During a press availability with European Council President Charles Michel, Zelenskyy expressed gratitude for the promised military aid but added that Ukraine’s battlefield needs are urgent, especially air defenses.
He also thanked the EU and Group of Seven nations for their pledge to use roughly $50 billion in frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine’s war effort.
Ahead of the meeting, Zelenskyy posted a statement on his official X account, saying he expected to sign a total of three security agreements with EU member nations, including one with the EU, as a whole.
“For the first time, this agreement will enshrine the commitment of all 27 Member States to provide Ukraine with extensive support, regardless of any internal institutional changes,” he said.
Referring to Ukraine’s EU accession talks, which began this week, he added, “Each step we take brings us closer to our historic goal of peace and prosperity in our common European home.”
Meanwhile, Ukraine said Thursday it thwarted nearly all of Russia’s overnight aerial attacks, with Ukrainian air defenses shooting down five Russian missiles and 23 drones.
The Ukrainian air force said Russian forces fired a total of six missiles at Ukraine, but did not specify the targets of the attacks.
Reports from regional officials showed Russia directed missiles and drones at parts of southern Ukraine.
Vitaliy Kim, governor of the Mykolaiv region, reported on Telegram that Ukrainian air defenses shot down six aerial drones and three cruise missiles.
In Kherson, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said on Telegram that Ukrainian forces shot down two drones.
Air defenses shot down another drone over the Dnipropetrovsk region, the governor there said on Telegram.
Russia’s defense ministry said its forces downed four Ukrainian aerial drones over the Tver region, northwest of Moscow, as well as two drones over the Moscow region and another over Belgorod.
Ukraine frequently targets Belgorod, which is located along the Russia-Ukraine border, with attacks against areas such as Moscow and Tver occurring more rarely.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/hired-goons-demand-for-full-payment-as-their-political-masters-disappear-after-anti-govt-protests-n345201,"'Hired goons' demand for full payment as their political masters disappear after anti-gov't protests
In an undated video, the men, who appear to have decided to air out their grievances deep in the night, are seen expressly calling out leaders who they claim had turned their backs on them - even after offering their 'services' during the demonstrations.
The alleged goons can be seen addressing politicians who they don't name, saying that they were woken up early morning and given instructions to go to City Hall before being deployed across the city to infiltrate the demonstrations and cause mayhem.
Armed with a 'rungu', one of the men makes his dissatisfaction clear, directly addressing his masters and demanding for pay.
""Nilipigiwa simu asubui, twende hapo City Hall. Tulikuwa watu 50, na mavijana wenzangu. Wakatupatia hizi rungu. Mnatupatia kazi mpaka wengine wanapigwa tear gas..."" he says, brandishing his 'rungu'.
""Saa hii tunapiga na hizo simu zenyu hazishikwi. Na tushaaokolea jo. Tumeshaawalindia mali zao. Tunaenda mpaka huko Riverside. Mlipiga simu twende City Hall? Pesa yetu mtatupatia!""
The men go on with their lamentations, claiming that they had only been paid a fraction of the entire sum - a downpayment - and were now asking for the entire payment to be settled, or else.
""Yenye mlitupatia asubui ni downpayment. Hio ingine tunataka. Lazima mtatumalizia. Hatutaki hio ujinga!"" they say.
Tuesday's protests were characterised by wanton looting, vandalism, hooliganism and thievery forcing many leaders and protesters to abandon the demonstrations altogether as they were now infiltrated by lawless characters.
Unlike in the last two weeks, where the protests have been largely peaceful and organised, recent protests have seen shadowy figures emerge to serve the purposes of their masters - throwing stones, setting buildings on fire, clobbering the police, robbing passers-by and generally wreaking havoc in their jurisdictions.
Reacting to the mayhem, the DCI said, ""Security forces across the country singled out suspects found engaging in criminal activities in the guise of protesting, and took them to custody.""
""The DCI has further deployed scrupulous investigators across the affected regions to pursue suspects captured on CCTV cameras and mobile phone recordings violently robbing, stealing and destroying properties and businesses of innocent citizens,"" the statement added.
According to the Daily Nation, six politicians, a businessman and two NGOs are on the radar of State intelligence and security agencies following suspicion of their involvement in fueling ongoing anti-government protests.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/gachagua-cannot-claim-ignorance-of-public-mood-governor-nassir-says-n344839,"Gachagua cannot claim ignorance of public mood: Governor Nassir says
The DP accused Haji of failing in his duties to adequately advise the president on the Finance Bill 2024, which allegedly led to demonstrations across the country. According to Gachagua, Haji’s intelligence reports could have prevented the widespread chaos and loss of lives witnessed on Tuesday and thus called for the DG to resign.
In a statement on Thursday, Nassir questioned why the DP sought to settle personal scores with Haji in public and did not seek to solve matters of security behind closed doors.
He reiterated that such utterances went against the oath that he took as Deputy President.
“It is deeply concerning that Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has chosen to publicly prosecute national security issues in the public domain, degenerating into personal attacks against Mr. Noordin Haji, the Director General of the National Intelligence Service, while absolving Mr. Japhet Koome, the Inspector General of Police, for the reckless manner in which our young people were handled by the police over the past week,” he said.
“Kenyans watched in horror as young people were killed and others were abducted as they exercised their democratic rights.”
Nassir also criticised Gachagua for failing to take up responsibility for the Finance Bill 2024 as the DP chairs all cabinet sub-committees and is privy to matters concerning the government.
The Mombasa governor noted that the DP could not have failed to read the mood of the public who had decried overtaxation by the current regime in the past months.
“These unbecoming utterances go against the solemn oath that Mr. Gachagua took. It exposes our nation, the institution of the Presidency, and our security agencies to ridicule, ethnic division, and potential exploitation by our country's enemies,” Nassir pointed out.
“At a time when the young generation has lost faith in the direction the country is moving, such remarks only serve to fuel confusion and public anger. It is regrettable that the Deputy President would casually discuss sensitive security matters in public instead of in the constitutional body - the National Security Council in which he is a member.”
Nassir reaffirmed that Gachagua’s choice to single out Haji for the protests was a weak attempt of creating a political scapegoat for internal differences within his political formation.
“Mr. Gachagua cannot claim ignorance of the public mood regarding over-taxation when he was at the front leading this conversation until his recent political schism with his partners in the Kenya Kwanza Administration,” he added.
“Kenyans need leadership. If there is one thing that our young people have shown the world, it is that common purpose can transcend narrow ethnic balkanization. We call upon the Deputy President to follow the lead of our young people and focus on issues rather than using this solemn moment in history to fight personal wars.”

Netherlands coach Ronald Koeman said his team proved they had ""a big heart"" as they came from behind to beat Turkey 2-1 on Saturday to reach the Euro 2024 semi-finals.
Two goals inside seven minutes helped the Dutch defeat Turkey in a tight quarter-final clash in Berlin and set up a final-four date with England on Wednesday.
Stefan de Vrij headed home an equaliser in the 70th minute after Samet Akaydin sent Turkey ahead, before Murt Muldur's own goal six minutes later handed Netherlands the victory.
""I think for the whole nation it's something special, we're a small nation and we're in the semis with England, France and Spain, and we're really proud,"" Koeman told reporters.
""We had to suffer tonight, but that's the same across the whole Euros, they gave everything, it was a really emotional match.
""We had a big heart -- sometimes we get criticism about that, that we don't have that compared to other nations, (but) the players showed a big heart tonight.""
Turkey fans dominated in the stands given their large diaspora in Germany but the Dutch survived the flares and piercing whistles to scrape through.
""We had to suffer -- it's a great success to be able to play the semi-final,"" added Koeman.
""You saw tonight there are no small nations, you need to fight and play well, there are difficult moments in a game whoever your opponent are.""

The body, which included members of the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU), had joined the protests to attend to medical emergencies.
The volunteer group of doctors, nurses, clinical officers, psychologists, nutritionists, paramedics, interns and students had set up medical camps in Nairobi and other towns, where injured protesters were taken for emergency services.
Ambulances were also on standby to attend to patients who required referral care.
Now, Medics for Kenya have announced the withdrawal of their services during protests over the violence that has marred the demonstrations recently.
“With the change in maandamano atmosphere and the deployment of goons, we as Medics For Kenya, highly value the lives of our volunteers. As we say in the corridors of hospitals, 'Your Safety Comes First'. Therefore, it is with much regret and pain that we announce MedicsForKenya will withdraw their medical camp services all across the country,” the body said in a statement on Tuesday.
The body’s co-founder, Dr. Austin Omondi added that its hotlines will remain open, and will coordinate services between emergency response providers and hospitals. ‘
In Nairobi, the medical camps had been set up in places such as Jamia Mosque, All Saints Cathedral and Holy Family Basilica.
Changing face of protest
What began as a peaceful protest on June 11, 2024 has morphed into violence-filled demonstrations, marred with excessive use of force by police officers.
On Tuesday, the demonstrations saw protesters clash with business persons in towns such as Nairobi and Mombasa.
Business operators in Nairobi were seen holding clubs, saying they are out to protect their businesses from invasion by looters.
A similar incident was witnessed in Mombasa, where the owner of Qaffee Point hotel clashed with demonstrators. The business owner shot at the protestors, leaving two with injuries.
The Directorate of Criminal Investigations also reports that other goons, taking advantage of the protests, accosted passersby in major roads and mugged them.
“DCI teams have been dispatched to pursue gang members recorded by concerned citizens violently robbing innocent Kenyans on the roads, while taking advantage of the ongoing demonstrations,” the DCI says, vowing to catch those involved in the criminal activities.

National Assembly Majority Leader Kimani Ichung’wah moved the motion and pointed out that the recess would allow the legislators to get comments from their constituents through public participation on the NGCDF proposals after the kitty was enhanced by Ksh.30 million.
Nominated MP John Mbadi, however, opposed the motion, calling for members to delay the recess to heed to the appeal by Kenyans in the anti-Finance Bill protests.
“We are at a critical moment in this country especially this week and next week. We are elected and it is important to delay the recess to study what is going on and if there’s a requirement we sit and make some adjustments then we would be here. It would be irresponsible when our young generation are protesting against some of the decisions we make,” he said.
Speaker Moses Wetangula moved the motion in Parliament which received unanimous approval from the majority of the members.
On Tuesday, the Finance Bill will move to the Committee of the Whole House whereby every amendment will be voted for on a clause-by-clause basis.
Thereafter, the bill will proceed to Third Reading whereby members will vote to either reject or pass the bill. If it passes, the bill will be assented into law by the president.

Jonathan Mutua, 29, is accused of stealing electronic appliances, 181 kilogrammes of goat meat, and over 100 bunches of traditional greens known as 'Managu', among other things.
According to court documents, the incident took place at the Baniyas hotel in Eldoret. The business belongs to Fredrick Kamau.
The suspect was arrested and charged after being discovered with electronic equipment in the Kamukunji area of Uasin Gishu shortly after the looting incident.
He denied the charges when he appeared before Eldoret Chief Magistrate, Cherono Kesse and was consequently freed on a Ksh.10million bond.
The case will be mentioned on July 15.
Several businesses in Eldoret were raided, vandalised, and looted during the anti-tax protests last week, including the footwear store Bata and MP Oscar Sudi's nightclub Timba XO.
The protests, which primarily demanded the total recall of the contentious Finance Bill 2024, entered their third week.
Protesters who demanded that the Head of State drop the bill now want him to resign, citing a lack of trust in his leadership following the deaths of 39 people during peaceful protests.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/gachagua-says-interior-ministry-is-frustrating-war-on-illicit-brew-warns-ruto-of-overzealous-officers-at-harambee-house-n345379,"Gachagua says Interior Ministry is frustrating war on illicit brew, warns Ruto of ‘overzealous officers at Harambee house’
According to Gachagua, the Interior Ministry has facilitated the re-opening of bars in the region, in an effort to frustrate his mission to end alcoholism in Mt Kenya.
“I heard that our local MP has directed security officers in Karatina, purportedly on orders from above to re-open bars. An MP cannot instruct security officers, if security officers from this region are taking instructions from an MP, we shall discipline them,” Gachagua told congregants at Kiamariga PEFA Church in Mathira Constituency on Sunday.
Gachagua stated that President William Ruto tasked him with leading a multi-sectoral group to end illicit brew and the drug abuse menace in Kenya, and among the measures agreed was the closure of illegal bars to tame sale of illicit brew.
He noted that during a walk in Mathira on Sunday morning, he spotted young men drunk and lying in the trenches, an indication that the alcoholism menace was back.
“I have never missed a single cabinet sitting, so there is no decision that has been made by the cabinet to stop war against illicit brew,” he said.
Gachagua went on to accuse the Interior Ministry, which is led by Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki, of thwarting his efforts to curb alcoholism.
“Anybody stopping that war or undermining it is setting the President and the government against the people. If you people at interior (Ministry) think that you want to interfere with this successful programme so as to undermine the Deputy President, you are effectively undermining President Ruto and his administration,” Gachagua remarked.
He warned President Ruto of the officers whose intention is to ‘set him up against the people’.
“Mr.President, if you allow overzealous officers at Harambee house, with a political scheme, to interfere with this war against illicit brew, those officers will set you up against the people.”
It is Gachagua’s opinion that the said persons at the Interior Ministry are frustrating his efforts because they think the programme has given him (Gachagua) popularity in Mt Kenya region.
“You will be hurting Ruto and his government. The popularity or otherwise of our administration will depend on interference or non-interference with the war against illicit brews,” he added.
The Deputy President was mandated to fight illicit brew, which claimed lives of tens of people in Mt.Kenya region early this year.
Among the measures put in place was the closure of the bars in the region to allow for a fresh vetting exercise.
In Kirinyaga County, which recorded most fatalities from illicit brew, nearly 700 bars had been closed. After a vetting exercise, an unconfirmed number of operators were given a green light.
Another measure put in place to tame illicit brew was an order stopping public officers from operating bars, and immediate closure of bars neighbouring schools and residential areas.

Kylian Mbappe will be officially presented as a Real Madrid player at the Santiago-Bernabeu stadium next Tuesday, the Spanish giants announced.
The confirmation came less than 24 hours after the former Paris Saint-Germain star and the France team were knocked out of Euro 2024 by Spain in the semi-finals.
Mbappe, who will wear the number 9 shirt, will be presented at the Bernabeu at midday (1000 GMT) on Tuesday and will be welcomed by Real president Florentino Perez for the signing of his five-year contract, the club announced on Wednesday.
France's captain had a disappointing Euro 2024 and was hampered by breaking his nose in his country's opening match against Austria and missed a late chance to equalise in the 2-1 defeat to Spain on Tuesday.
Mbappe is due to have his first competitive game for the Spanish and European champions when they open their La Liga defence against Real Mallorca on the weekend of August 17/18, with his first taste of the Bernabeu coming a week later when Madrid host promoted Real Valladolid.
Mbappe joins Real as a free agent on a reported annual salary of 15 million euros ($16.2 million), with bonuses attached to his arrival in the Spanish capital of over 100 million euros.

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/ibs-warns-against-complacency-as-city-thunder-take-on-equity-dumas-n345270,"Ibs warns against complacency as City Thunder take on Equity Dumas
Despite having one foot into the
final of the Kenya National Basketball Men’s Premier League, Nairobi City
Thunder head coach Brad Ibs believes all is not over and they must give their A
game when they face Equity Dumas Friday night.
The two sides meet for Game Three
of the semi-final playoffs tonight with a win guaranteeing Thunder a place in the
final while Equity will need to win Friday night, Saturday and Sunday with
triple wins guaranteeing them a place in the final.
The two sides meet again for
basketball night at the Nyayo Gymnasium, Nairobi.
“In practice we have been focusing
on getting better and cleaning up some of our weak spots and enhancing our
strength. The job is far from done, I think playing such a good team it becomes
a challenge and we are really taking the Friday game seriously and then we will
figure out what next after that.
“I’m looking forward to another
great night of basketball at Nyayo,” Ibs said.
In Game One and Game Twos, Thunder
won 79-77 and 69-66 respectively two weeks ago to take one foot into the final
where they are likely to face defending champions Kenya Ports Authority (KPA).
At the same time, the soft-spoken
tactician has admitted that the on-going protests in the country have affected
their training program ahead of the clash.
“Preparations have been good
overall but obviously it has been a bit disjointed in regards to the larger
protests that have been going on. We were prioritising the safety of the
players but at the same time trying to be wise about getting the necessary
training time needed which we had to be creative with it.
“We believe we still have room for
improvement despite winning the first two games of the series which is a good
feeling,” Ibs added.

During the attack, the DCI says, the suspects seriously injured several police officers, maliciously destroyed property and robbed an anti-riot gun from a police officer.
""Already, one of the suspects (Sostine Otieno) captured in a phone recording attacking a police officer and leaving him sprawled on the tarmac before robbing him of his anti-riot gun (launcher) has been arrested and the gun recovered, as pursuit for his accomplices who have since been identified heightens,"" said the DCI.
The injured officer is admitted in critical condition at a Bondo hospital.

Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga has faulted
President William Ruto's advisers for the dire economic and political turmoil
currently gripping Kenya, amplified by recent anti-government demonstrations.
Speaking on Wednesday, Kahiga asserted that
President Ruto has recently found himself between a rock and a hard
place due to what he termed as misguided advice from his own people.
""There are men and women around you who
you could be calling advisers but you are in the hole you are today because of
misadvise they have given you,"" Kahiga said.
To further drive his point home, the Governor
referenced recent demands made by Kenyan protesters during the height of the
anti-government demonstrations, among them the reshuffling of Cabinet.
Instead of addressing the concerns promptly,
Kahiga went on, President Ruto proposed the establishment of a 6-day,
150-member national multi-sectoral conference to tackle issues raised
during the protests, much to the dismay of Kenyans.
""You've made so many promises; they will
not be achieved in this kind of atmosphere. The Gen Zs have made demands, you
engaged with them and they told you what they want. None of their demands was for
you to put up a 150-member team to negotiate. They have clearly told you they
want you to do this and that. It is that simple,"" he said.
""If they say re-organise your Cabinet,
kindly do so...if they say sack it, do it…there are 50 million Kenyans who can fit
in that office.""
Further, the Nyeri County chief warned the
Head of State of potential severe consequences if he does not accurately
address and promptly act on the concerns of Kenyans.
""If you continue that kind of talk and
push, kind of moving away from reality, it will hit us hard and as a country we
will lose it all. You have a golden opportunity and this is a defining moment
for you. Mr. President, kindly think about this nation and do the very best you
can,"" stated Kahiga.
""A wise man wakes up each morning and has
retrospection in him and sees how things are. It does not matter who is close
to you. In politics it is your skin that matters and this is a nation whose
existence and survival are in your hands. It is important for you to take
action; the best action that you think should be taken.""

https://www.citizen.digital/news/cs-nakhumicha-tells-interns-to-report-to-health-centres-pending-pay-resolution-n345575,"CS Nakhumicha tells interns to report to health centres pending pay resolution
In a statement, the CS explained that the budget allocated to the Ministry of Health (Ksh.3.7 billion) in the 2024/25 budget will not be adequate to facilitate the posting of 3,760 interns which requires Ksh.4.8 billion.
She listed the three options on the table in the ongoing discussions with the Kenya Medical Practitioners Pharmacists Dentists Union (KMPDU) which involves either posting all doctors at the recommended monthly rate of Ksh.70,000 proposed by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC) or using the funds allocated in the budget to post at least 552 interns on a monthly rate of Ksh.206,400 monthly as per the 2017 Collective Bargaining Rate (CBA).
The third option is to await the court's direction whereby the advisory by SRC to propose a Ksh.70,000 monthly stipend for the interns was challenged in the Employment and Labour Relations Court. The ruling will be delivered on September 26, 2024.
""The above notwithstanding the Ministry recognizes the loss in time and highly recommends the interns across the cadres to report to their internship centres as communicated earlier pending the resolution of the package,"" the statement read in part.
CS Nakhumicha also addressed the #OccupyMOH movement that has seen hundreds of medical, dental and pharmacy interns storm the Ministry of Health headquarters while demanding for her resignation.
She explained that some characters sought to use the peaceful demonstrations to paint a picture of inaction and incompetence against the Health Ministry.
""It is regrettable that despite the open and candid discussions with the union officials and representatives of the interns, a few individuals are attempting to use the demonstrations and assembly as an opportunity to paint an image of inaction, neglect and incompetence against the Ministry of Health, hoping that this will propagate a feeling of hopelessness and incite chaos among the wider population,"" she said.
Nakhumicha reassured the public that the ongoing discussions would ultimately solve the stalemate as all parties would come to a mutual decision.
The statement comes amid months of stalemate involving the Ministry and health stakeholders over the 2017 CBA agreement. In March, health workers downed their tools and staged a 56-day strike while demanding the government address their grievances.
The strike culminated in a Return-to-work formula which was signed by both parties on May 8, 2024, which provided the formation of a taskforce to rationalise the remuneration of all health workers across the country.

Austria coach Ralf Rangnick bemoaned his side's fortune in bowing out of Euro 2024 on Tuesday following a 2-1 loss to Turkey, as he hit out at the boring football played by other sides at the tournament.
Rangnick's men had emerged as potential dark horses after topping a group containing France and the Netherlands.
But they were undone by their set-piece defending in the last 16 tie as Turkey defender Merih Demiral scored twice in Leipzig.
Michael Gregoritsch quickly pulled a goal back for Austria and only a stunning save from Mert Gunok denied Christoph Baumgartner a dramatic equaliser deep into stoppage-time.
""We didn't have the necessary luck,"" said the former Manchester United coach.
""I believe if the game had gone into extra-time we would have won the game because the Turkish team were exhausted and we had a physical advantage.""
Austria scored seven goals in their four games at the tournament -- more than England, France and Portugal, who have all advanced into the last eight.
""I think the four games we played were very entertaining, including today's game,"" added Rangnick.
""Not everything went as accurately as we want. We could've played a few passes better but four very entertaining, intense games.
""I've seen other games when it was difficult to even stay awake and that was not the case in our games.""
Turkey will face the Netherlands in the last eight in Berlin on Saturday.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/gachagua-is-a-lying-dishonourable-man-moses-kuria-responds-n344764,"'Gachagua is a lying, dishonourable man,' Moses Kuria responds
Public Service Cabinet Secretary Moses
Kuria has dismissed Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua’s comments that the deadly
protests against the Finance Bill 2024 could have been prevented if his boss, President
William Ruto had been given intelligence about the public discontent it sparked.
After President William Ruto on Wednesday
announced he would not sign the contentious Bill as a result of mounting public
pressure, Gachagua gave a separate televised address blaming the National
Intelligence Service (NIS) for what he termed as a failure to do their job.
He called the last-minute decision by
President Ruto to recall the Bill ‘embarrassing’ to the government and even urged
NIS Director-General Noordin Haji to resign.
“Ruto deserves better, he deserves a DG who
knows what he is doing, who is effective and can analyse situations to keep the
government informed,” Gachagua said from Mombasa.
Kuria has however branded Gachagua a liar,
saying the DP is a part and parcel of the Kenya Kwanza team that was pushing for
the proposed law.
“The Committee meeting that endorsed the
original Finance Bill which included VAT for milk and bread was chaired by the
Deputy President. What a lying, dishonourable man!” the minister wrote on X on
Wednesday night.
In choosing not to assent to the proposed
law, President Ruto referred it back to Parliament with his reservations,
proposing the deletion of all clauses.
The Bill proposed increased taxation as
Ruto’s government sought to raise an additional Ksh.346.7 billion in revenue
for the 2024/25 budget.
Peaceful youth-led demonstrations against
it have however turned deadly as police fired live bullets and tear gas
canisters at protesters.
The death toll on Wednesday stood at 22,
according to the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights, which said over 300
others were injured and 50 more arrested.
But even after Ruto’s announcement that he
would not assent to the 2024 Finance Bill, a section of demonstrators on social
media said they were still prepared to resume protests Thursday in solidarity
with those police killed.

The move is part of the government's policy to curb food inflation, which has climbed to over 40% year-on-year, and spur growth which has been fragile for almost a decade.
President Bola Tinubu has asked his economic management team to prepare a 2 trillion naira ($1.33 billion) stimulus plan to address concerns about food supplies and pricing and bolster key sectors, the finance minister said last week.
""To ameliorate food inflation in the country caused by affordability and exacerbated by availability, the government has taken a raft of measures to be implemented over the next 180 days,"" Agricultural Minister Abubakar Kyari said in a statement posted on X.
He said that the government would import 250,000 metric tons of wheat and 250,000 metric tons of maize in addition to imports by the private sector. The commodities will be imported in their semi-processed state and target supplies to small-scale processors and millers.
Food inflation has soared in the West African nation with insecurity in parts of the country's food producing regions and poor road network linking farms to markets.
Soaring costs of food staples have deepened the cost of living crisis and added to double-digit inflation which is stuck at nearly 30-year high.
Kyari said the tax waiver would cover food commodities imported through the country's land and sea borders.

The Alliance of Sahel States treaty, signed on Saturday, underscored the three countries' determination to turn their backs on the 15-member ECOWAS, which has been urging them to return to democratic rule.
ECOWAS commission president Omar Touray said freedom of movement and a common market of 400 million people were some of the major benefits of the near 50-year-old bloc, but that these were under threat if the three countries left.
Funding of economic projects worth over $500 million in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger could also be stopped or suspended, Touray told an ECOWAS summit in Nigerian capital Abuja.
""Considering these benefits, it is evident that disintegration will not only disrupt the freedom of movement and settlement of people, but it will also worsen insecurity in the region,"" he said.
The three countries' withdrawal will be a major blow to security cooperation particularly in terms of intelligence sharing and participation in the fight against terrorism, he added.
ECOWAS leaders gathered at the summit to discuss the implications of the treaty by the Alliance of Sahel States, whose juntas seized control in a series of coups in the three states in 2020-2023 and severed military and diplomatic ties with regional allies and Western powers.

France coach Didier Deschamps hit back at allegations his side had reached Tuesday's Euro 2024 semi-final against Spain playing ""boring"" football despite failing to score a goal from open play.
France have scored just three goals so far this tournament -- a Kylian Mbappe penalty and two own goals -- but have made it to the last four, where they face a Spain side who have impressed most in Germany.
Under Deschamps, France have made it to the final of three of the past four major tournaments, winning the World Cup in 2018.
Asked about playing ""boring football"", the coach said fans could be inspired by the team's success.
""Maybe it's not the same as it was in the past, but we do have the capability to spark emotions and make lots of French men and women happy with our results, especially after a difficult period in our country.
""If you are bored, watch another game -- you don't have to watch us, it's fine.""
France scored 16 goals at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, with Mbappe bagging eight. Les Bleus lost the final on penalties to Argentina.
Mbappe broke his nose in France's Euros opener against Austria and missed the 0-0 draw with the Netherlands. He returned wearing a protective mask, which Deschamps said the superstar forward was still getting used to.
""We are convinced Kylian is in the right headspace, as are all of our players. He had an issue with his back, took a blow to the nose, it could have been the end of the road for him but he's still here,"" said Deschamps.
""His field of vision is changed and it was a huge shock to him.
""I'm convinced he will do everything he can tomorrow.""
Antoine Griezmann, who scored six goals for France at Euro 2016, has also failed to fire.
""I think everyone is surprised because we know what Antoine is capable of. We saw what he pulled out of the bag at the World Cup, where he was at the peak of his powers as a player,"" teammate Adrien Rabiot said Monday.
""I don't know the reason... We have high expectations when it comes to Antoine and we expect a lot because he's capable.
""If someone's having a rough patch then we're here to support them, but obviously it'd be better if we had the Kylian and the Antoine (we know) playing here at the Euros.""
The midfielder suggested a long club season could be the reason the duo have struggled in Germany.
""Their legs aren't as fresh as they could be but we're 100 percent behind them, they're players that can change the game at any point, especially if we want to get to the final.""
Rabiot backed the French to go far as a collective, saying ""team spirit is more important than winning on the individual front"".

https://www.citizen.digital/wananchi-reporting/wananchi-opinion-gen-z-the-promise-and-the-peril-n344720,"WANANCHI OPINION: Gen Z: The Promise and the Peril
The recent demonstrations in Kenya's capital, which spread across the country, marked a significant departure from past protests. The nation was taken aback to witness young, well-dressed individuals, proficient in both the Queen's English and Sheng, articulate, fearless, and defiant towards the authorities. Their only weapon was the ubiquitous smartphone—a device that feeds(Money transfers), informs(internet), and protects them, acting as a personal surveillance tool. As a nation, we must examine the factors fueling this generation and, more importantly, harness them for the growth and development of Kenya.
New Financial Architecture
One of the defining characteristics of Generation Z is their embrace of new technologies, particularly blockchain. Blockchain technology offers a revolutionary approach to how individuals can transact, store, and transfer value. Its key characteristic—decentralization—makes these platforms resistant to censorship, heralding a new era of ""freedom money,"" where governments are not involved in the minting or supply of currencies. This shift could redefine economic power and financial inclusion in Kenya.
Peril: The promise of decentralization also brings challenges. The lack of regulation in the blockchain space can lead to increased risks of fraud and financial instability. The anonymity provided by these platforms may be exploited for illegal activities, undermining trust in the financial system and potentially destabilizing the economy.
Promise: On the flip side, blockchain technology has the potential to democratize access to financial services, enabling even the unbanked populations in Kenya to participate in the economy. It can foster innovation, reduce transaction costs, and promote economic freedom, contributing to a more inclusive and resilient financial system.
Global Opportunities
Social media platforms like Facebook, YouTube, X, and TikTok have opened up a world of economic opportunities for Kenyan youth. These platforms allow individuals to transcend geographical boundaries, offering access to global markets and audiences. Kenyan youth are no longer confined to their local job markets; they can create content, engage in digital entrepreneurship, and earn from a global audience, reducing reliance on their country of origin for employment.
Peril: The lure of instant fame and financial gain can incentivize behaviors that prioritize engagement and virality over authenticity and meaningful content. This can lead to a culture of superficiality, where the pursuit of likes and followers overshadows the importance of substantive contributions to society. Moreover, the volatility of income from social media can lead to economic instability for those who rely solely on these platforms.
Promise: The global reach of social media offers unprecedented opportunities for Kenyan youth to showcase their talents, share their culture, and contribute to the global digital economy. It can empower them to become creators and entrepreneurs, driving innovation and economic growth. Additionally, the skills acquired through digital platforms—such as digital marketing, content creation, and online communication—are invaluable in the modern economy and can lead to more diverse and sustainable career paths.
Surveillance Tools
Smartphones, the emblematic tool of Generation Z, are powerful surveillance devices. They can record and relay information at the click of a button, promoting transparency and accountability. The ability to document events and share them instantly incentivizes good behavior among law enforcement officers and deters misconduct, as actions can be scrutinized by a global audience.
Peril: The omnipresence of smartphones also raises concerns about privacy and the potential for misuse. Constant surveillance can lead to a society where personal freedoms are curtailed, and individuals are constantly monitored. The erosion of privacy can create a climate of fear and mistrust, where individuals feel they are always under scrutiny.
Promise: However, the transparency facilitated by smartphones can be a powerful tool for social justice and civic engagement. It empowers individuals to hold authorities accountable, exposes injustices, and fosters a culture of openness and accountability. In a society where information is power, smartphones equip the youth with the tools they need to advocate for their rights and drive positive change.
Harnessing the Potential
The Gen Z generation in Kenya presents both significant opportunities and challenges. Their embrace of new technologies, global platforms, and the power of information has the potential to drive significant economic and social change. However, it is crucial to navigate the perils associated with these advancements to ensure that they contribute to a more inclusive, equitable, and prosperous future for all Kenyans.
As a nation, we must foster an environment that supports the positive potential of Generation Z while mitigating the risks. By investing in education, creating supportive regulatory frameworks, and promoting a culture of innovation and responsibility, Kenya can harness the promise of its youth to build a brighter future.

Recently crowned African Senior Athletics Championships winner Sarah Moraa and silver medallist Edmund Serem will headline the Kenyan team of 19 athletes to this year’s World Athletics Under-20 Championships scheduled for August 27-31 in Lima, Peru.
Serem clocked 8:34.76 to win the 3000m steeplechase race during trials held at Nyayo Stadium on Friday as Mathew Kipkosgei settled for a second place after timing 8:36.62 to bag the other ticket of the youthful fiesta.
Serem, who clinched silver in the men’s 3000m steeplechase in the recently concluded Senior Athletics Championships in Doula, Cameroon, says he is drawing inspiration from his elder brother Amos Serem, who is the 2022 Commonwealth Games bronze medallist.
Amos is also a gold medallist at the 2021 World Athletics U20 Championships held in Nairobi.
“I’m happy to get the ticket. I still need to work on speed and barrier jumps before the championship, but I'll work hard to bring home the gold medal,” Serem said in a post-race interview.
Kipkosgei, who hails from the athletics powerhouse Kimuron Secondary School, aims to follow in the footsteps of his father legendary steeplechaser William Kosgei.
“I will talk to Edmund, and we will work as a team to bring glory to Kenya. I want to be among the best steeplechasers in Kenya, and soon, we will reclaim the country's steeplechase prowess,” said Kipkosgei.
In the women's 800m, Sarah Moraa, cousin to World 800m champion Mary Moraa, clocked 2:00.01 to win the two-lap race final.
She will be on the plane to Peru alongside Janet Jepkemoi Amimo, who timed 2:03.16 to finish second.
Despite her impressive performance, Moraa's bid to qualify for the Paris Olympics fell short and she will solely focus on the World Under-20 Championship.
The team also includes fast-rising 2023 Commonwealth Youth Games champion Kelvin Koech Kimutai, who clocked 1:46.77 in the men’s 800m final. He will be joined by Phanuel Kipkosgei Koech.
Kimutai, who trains under coach Eliud Kirarei from Kosirai Nandi, expressed confidence in his preparation and aims to emulate former world under-20 800m champion Emmanuel Wanyonyi.
“The race was fast, and this gives me enough motivation that I will do well in Lima. I'm not under any pressure after winning the Commonwealth Games, and I gained valuable experience. I hope to hit the podium.”

https://www.citizen.digital/news/cak-approves-merger-between-two-companies-after-penalty-for-unauthorized-partnership-n345436,"CAK approves merger between two companies after penalty for unauthorized partnership
According to a report by CAK, Sika International acquired direct control of LSF11 Skyscrapper Holdco S.a.r.l. and indirect control of Master Builders Solutions Kenya Ltd in May 2023, following the closure of the global transaction.
In October 2023, the parties reported to the authority that the merger in Kenya was implemented following the close of the global deal in May 2023, while noting that the transaction had not adhered to the Competition Act and was not cleared by the Authority.
""The parties indicated that they were desirous to settle the matter administratively and, in compliance with section 46 of the Competition Act, pay a financial penalty, and thereafter regularize the transaction,"" said CAK.
The Authority therefore ordered the parties to pay a penalty of Ksh.17.4 million for contravening section 42 (2) of the Competition Act and regularize the transaction based on the applicable thresholds.
Section 42 (2) dictates that ""No person, either individually or jointly or in concert with any other person, may implement a proposed merger to which this part applies, unless the proposed merger is approved by the Authority and implemented in accordance with any conditions attached to the approval.""
Upon payment of the penalty, the parties filed a merger application with the Authority and the transaction was excluded from full analysis and subsequently approved.
Meanwhile, the authority has urged businesses that are uncertain whether a proposed transaction may trigger a merger notification in Kenya to engage them prior to implementing the transaction.
""The transaction qualified as a merger within the meaning of sections 2 and 41 of the Competition Act CAP 504 of the Laws of Kenya.
The Competition Act stipulates that a merger, or takeover, may occur when an undertaking directly or indirectly acquires control over another business within Kenya. This may happen through, among others, purchase/lease of shares, exchange of shares, or vertical integration.

https://www.citizen.digital/tech/kenya-leads-africa-as-2024-start-up-funding-dips-n345509,"Kenya leads Africa as 2024 start-up funding dips
Kenya took a third of the investment poured
into African start-ups in the first half of 2024, news data shows, even though
overall venture funding towards the continent has dipped.
Records from the funding database Africa: The Big Deal show that African start-ups have raised $780 million (Ksh.100 billion), excluding exits.
Seventy-nine per cent of this funding went
to ventures based in Africa’s ‘Big Four’, where Kenya’s start-up ecosystem is
classified alongside Nigeria, Egypt and South Africa.
Kenyan ventures have so far received $244
million (Ksh.31 billion), which is 32 per cent of the continent’s total,
followed by Nigeria ($172 million), Egypt ($101 million) and South Africa ($85
million).
Among the top-funded start-ups in the first
half of 2024 were Nigerian logistics start-up Moove and Kenya’s M-Kopa, which
provides solar lighting systems, televisions, fridges, smartphones and
financial services.
The data indicates that between January and June 2024, M-Kopa got a $51
million loan from the United States International Development Finance
Corporation (DFC).
Others are the Benin headquartered e-mobility
start-up Spiro, which has operations in Kenya and got a $50 million loan from the
African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank).
But the numbers also show a slow
year for African start-ups. The $780 million investment is a 31 per cent drop
compared to the second semester of 2023.
It also represents a 57 per cent decline
compared to the funding African start-ups secured in the first half of 2023.
“H1 has been the quietest semester in terms
of start-up funding in Africa since late 2020,” the report says.
Sixty-six per cent of this funding ($513
million) was in the form of equity while 33 per cent ($254 million) was debt.
Sector-wise, transport and logistics attracted
the most funding followed by fintech then start-ups in energy and water.
“Only a fraction of the funding continued
to go to female-founded and female-led start-ups with 85 per cent of the funding going
to ventures without a single female founder and 92 per cent to companies with a male
CEO,” says the report.
At the close of 2023, Kenyan start-ups
accounted for the majority of investment poured into African ventures that year
with just under $800 million, which was 28 per cent of the continent’s total.
African start-ups had until late 2022 enjoyed
a boom in funding from venture capital firms, with financial technology
(fintech) firms accounting for most of the investment secured.
But from 2023, there was a decreased activity called ‘funding winter’ attributed to rising inflation, weakening
currency, and unfavourable interest rates which led foreign investors to shift
capital from emerging and frontier economies.
The $800 million funding Kenyan ventures
got last year, for instance, was a 25 per cent year-on-year decline.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/ragtag-militia-infiltrating-peaceful-protests-gideon-moi-condemns-violence-in-protests-n345067,"'Ragtag militia infiltrating peaceful protests,' Gideon Moi condemns violence in protests
KANU Party Leader Gideon Moi has come out to condemn the violence
witnessed in Tuesday’s protests, saying that goons have sabotaged the once peaceful protests.
Moi, in a statement, noted that the last two weeks had seen
notably peaceful protests attended by demonstrators carrying placards, water,
and chanting in solidarity.
The former Baringo Senator, however, said that the peaceful
protesters have since been replaced by goons who are looting openly and vandalising
property.
“Over the past two weeks, the protests have been notably
peaceful, characterized by participants carrying placards, and water, and
chanting in solidarity,” said Moi.
However, today's protests have been visibly infiltrated by a
ragtag militia engaged in looting, vandalizing property, and stealing from
individuals. These evidently well-organized infiltrations are clearly aimed at
discrediting the genuine protestors. We strongly condemn these acts of looting
and vandalism.”
Moi thus appealed to the Gen Z protestors to look out for
those out to tarnish their names and isolate them for law enforcers to nab
them.
He also urged security personnel to apprehend and arraign the
looters while at the same time protecting peaceful demonstrators.
“We urge genuine protestors to remain vigilant and to help
identify and isolate individuals seeking to exploit the protests for their own
gain,” said Moi.
“We call on security officers to swiftly arrest and charge
these disruptive elements, while also ensuring the protection of the peaceful
and unarmed protestors.”
Since the protests started more than two weeks ago, human rights have reported that 39 people have lost their lives, over 300 people have been injured and property worth billions has been destroyed.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/kenyan-activists-call-for-more-protests-as-govt-pledges-austerity-n345017,"Kenyan activists call for more protests as govt pledges austerity
At least 24 people were killed in clashes between protesters and police last week, when parliament was briefly stormed and set ablaze.
The protests, which have been led by young people and organised largely on social media, were initially sparked by a finance bill intended to raise 346 billion Kenyan shillings ($2.69 billion) in taxes.
But the demands of many protesters have escalated over the past two weeks to include calls to root out corruption and for Ruto to step down, presenting the most serious crisis of his two-year-old presidency.
An interview Ruto gave on Sunday evening to Kenyan television networks, in which he mostly defended the actions of the police and his government, seemed to have only hardened the positions of protesters.
On Monday, activists were sharing pamphlets on social media that urged people to occupy the capital Nairobi's Central Business District. Many posted under the hashtag #OccupyCBDTuesday.
The protest movement has no official leadership, and it was not clear to what extent people would respond to these calls after tens of thousands came out last week in some of the country's largest protests in recent memory.
In audio forums on social media, activists have been discussing how to maintain momentum now that the immediate objective of killing the finance bill has been attained.
SPENDING CUTS
In his interview on Sunday, Ruto reiterated his previous calls for dialogue with young people. He said he was prepared to do this in a forum of their choosing, including the X Spaces where they often gather to discuss issues and strategise.
Many protesters reject the calls for dialogue, seeing them as an effort to co-opt the movement.
""You can’t dialogue with someone who is killing you on the other hand,"" one activist said during an X Space over the weekend.
Ruto defended the conduct of the police in his interview, saying they had done the best they could under the circumstances and blaming ""criminals"" who he said had hijacked peaceful protests.
Ruto also suggested in the interview that the budget gap caused by the withdrawal of proposed tax hikes would be funded by borrowing, seemingly contradicting earlier statement that money would be saved through austerity measures.
Asked about this on Monday, Finance Minister Njuguna Ndung'u noted that there are legal limits on borrowing and the carrying capacity of debt.
""So it means that we must have expenditure cuts. This will be known once Parliament approves Supplementary one (budget),"" he told Reuters in a text message.
Kenya's national debt of more than 70% of gross domestic product already surpasses the statutory limit of 55% of GDP.
After withdrawing the bill, Ruto asked lawmakers to pass a supplementary budget, but parliament is currently in recess.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/icc-convicts-mali-islamist-for-timbuktu-atrocities-n344746,"ICC convicts Mali Islamist for Timbuktu atrocities
In a summary of their verdict, the judges said Al Hassan Ag Abdoul Aziz played an important role in the Ansar Dine Islamist group, which took the city on the fringe of the Sahara desert in 2012 and tried to impose sharia Islamic law.
Local inhabitants testified that he was considered a key player within the Islamic police force who could issue orders and police officers would carry them out.
""Al Hassan has been found guilty by majority decision of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including torture, cruel treatment and outrages upon personal dignity, for the public flogging of 13 members of the population"" of Timbuktu, Presiding Judge Antoine Kesia-Mbe Mindua said.
Al Hassan has pleaded not guilty to all charges, but has not denied he was a member of Ansar Dine. His lawyers have argued he was trying to maintain order in a chaotic situation after the rebel takeover of Timbuktu.
NO EMOTION
Clad in a traditional West African yellow robe and white head dress, Al Hassan, 47, showed no emotion when the court also convicted him of religious persecution and the war crimes of mutilation and participating in sham trials.
Prosecutors had charged Al Hassan with a number of gender-based crimes, saying the Islamic police terrorised the women of Timbuktu, who were subjected to rape, forced marriages and sexual slavery.
While judges said rape and forced marriages did take place in Timbuktu they found Al Hassan bore no responsibility for such crimes.
Prosecutors have 30 days from the judgment to file an appeal.
Al Hassan's sentence will be determined at a later date after another round of hearings. The ICC can impose a maximum sentence of life in prison.
Al Qaeda-linked fighters of Ansar Dine also used pick-axes, shovels and hammers to shatter earthen tombs and centuries-old shrines reflecting Timbuktu's Sufi version of Islam in what is known as the ""City of 333 Saints"".
But judges found that Al Hassan had no role in the destruction and acquitted him for charges related to the attacks.
Last Friday the ICC unsealed an arrest warrant for the alleged leader of Ansar Dine, Iyad Ag Ghaly, also known as Abou Fadl.
Another Islamist rebel was given a nine-year sentence by the ICC in 2016 after pleading guilty to participating in destruction of Timbuktu's religious monuments.
The ICC, the world's only permanent war crimes tribunal, has been examining events in Mali since 2012. French and Malian troops pushed the rebels back the following year.

England manager Gareth Southgate was met with boos and beer cups
thrown by his own fans despite his team topping Group C as Slovenia also
progressed to the knockout stages of Euro 2024 thanks to a 0-0 draw in Cologne.
The Three Lions were already assured of a place in the last 16 but
can expect more criticism after failing to improve on underwhelming
performances in edging past Serbia and drawing with Denmark.
""I get it that they are not happy with me, that is the
reality. I am not going to back away from that. I need them behind the
team,"" Southgate said of the supporters' reaction.
""I was not going to back away from going over to thank people
for coming and giving the support that they did, but I know that this is
causing an issue for the group.""
England will have to wait until Wednesday's final group games to
find out which of the four best third-placed teams they will face in the last
16.
But more questions will be asked over one of the favourites'
ability to end a 58-year wait for major tournament glory as a star-studded
forward line was snuffed out by Slovenia.
""I thought we played a lot better than the other games. We
couldn't just find that finish but we look forward to the next one,"" said
England captain Harry Kane.
Southgate made a statement with his team selection, resisting the
calls to make mass changes as Conor Gallagher replaced Trent Alexander-Arnold
in the only alteration from the opening two games.
If the England boss was looking for a reaction by showing faith in
the other 10 who have started all three matches in Germany, he was left
disappointed.
Slovenia are now nine games unbeaten, which included beating
Portugal 2-0 in a pre-tournament friendly.
Declan Rice had highlighted Benjamin Sesko as their big threat on
Monday.
Sesko could have been lining up alongside Rice at Arsenal next
season had he not shunned interest to extend his contract at RB Leipzig.
The 21-year-old shrugged off a thigh injury to start and had the
first chance of the game when he tamely headed straight at Jordan Pickford four
minutes in.
- Slovenian celebrations -
It took 20 minutes for England to pose a serious threat and only
the offside flag denied them a slick opening goal.
Rice picked out Phil Foden's run but the Manchester City
midfielder had strayed beyond the Slovenian defence before squaring for Bukayo
Saka to tap in.
Southgate took action at the break as Gallagher was replaced by
Kobbie Mainoo.
The 19-year-old added some much needed thrust to the England
midfield but they still struggled to turn dominance in possession into chances.
Kane saw a header cleared by Sesko from a corner and Rice flashed
a shot wide from the edge of the box.
Southgate answered the call to give Cole Palmer his first minutes
of the tournament in the final 20 minutes.
The Chelsea midfielder, who scored 26 goals at club level this
season, had England's only shot on target of the second half but failed to
seriously test veteran goalkeeper Jan Oblak.
A point was jubilantly celebrated by the Slovenians as it did
enough for them to progress as one of the best third-placed sides thanks to three
draws from their three games.
Matjaz Kek's men missed out on second place in the group solely
due to Denmark's better disciplinary record.
""I
didn't expect to be going into the knockout phase,"" said Kek. ""But we
showed with our play we deserved to be here and go into the knockouts against
one of the favourites for the tournament.""

France coach Didier Deschamps dropped misfiring forward Antoine Griezmann for Ousmane Dembele in Tuesday's Euro 2024 semi-final clash with Spain in Munich.
Griezmann has started all but one of five matches so far at the tournament but has failed to spark in a France attack which is yet to score from open play.
France's three strikes have come from two own goals and a penalty converted by captain Kylian Mbappe.
Les Bleus are also yet to concede from open play in the tournament. Their one goal conceded came from a penalty scored by Poland striker Robert Lewandowski.
Injuries and suspension have forced Spain coach Luis de la Fuente to make three changes to his starting XI, including starting Dani Olmo for the injured Pedri.
Pedri injured his knee early in Spain's 2-1 quarter-final win over Germany and was replaced by Olmo, who was named man of the match after scoring a goal and laying on an assist.

Kipyegon will return to the scene of her 5000m world record where she will headline a sparkling array of world beaters, just a few weeks before attempting a historic 1500m three-peat triumph in the same city.
The 1500m and one-mile world record holder threw down the gauntlet earlier this month after easing to victory during the Summer Games trials held at Nyayo Stadium where she reigned supreme in 5000m and 1500m to grab the two tickets.
Kipyegon clocked 14:05.20 to obliterate the 12-and-half-lap race record last year which was later broken by Gudaf Tsegay, but the Kenyan still ended the season as Diamond League champion, claiming her fourth career Diamond Trophy in the 1500m.
Remarkably, Kipyegon's record-breaking performance in the 5,000m came one week after she set a world record in the 1,500-meter event at the Florence Diamond League.
Kipyegon and Duplantis are among the six reigning world champions on the Paris entry lists, with Ukrainian high jumper Yaroslava Mahuchikh, Dominican Diamond League 400m champion Marileidy Paulino, Serbian long jumper Ivana Vuleta and Bahraini steeplechaser Winfried Yavi also set to compete.
The Meeting de Paris will be an Olympic dress rehearsal for many of the sport's biggest names, with pole vault world record holder Mondo Duplantis and German long jump star Malaika Mihambo both already confirmed to compete at the Stade Charléty.
Yavi, who broke an Asian record on her way to the Diamond League title in Eugene last year, will go up against Kenya's Beatrice Chepkoech, who has held the steeplechase world record since she clocked 8:44.32 at the Monaco Diamond League back in 2018.

The netizens, led by social activist Hanifa Adan are up in arms after Nakhumicha claimed that protesters were being treated for free in government hospitals despite efforts to fundraise.
Taking to her X account, Hanifa shot down claims made by the Health Cabinet Secretary who claimed that all the protest victims at various referral hospitals had had their bills sorted by the government and that the Hanifa-led M-CHANGA fund had not played a part in the entire process.
On July 3, the CS said that out of the 294 victims who had been admitted to various referral hospitals, 235 had already been treated for various degrees of injuries and discharged and none had been asked for payment.
""My attention has been drawn to efforts by some individuals to raise funds from the public to pay hospital bills for persons injured during the demonstrations,"" she wrote.
""Out of the total 294 casualties attended to in our Referral Hospitals, 235 have been treated for various degrees of injuries and discharged and non has been asked for payment. 58 are still admitted with 1 in ICU, 3 waiting for theatre.""
Quickly countering the CS, Hanifa said that Kenyatta National Hospital was uncooperative, adding that she had to transfer several cases from KNH to Nairobi West Hospital.
""Wewe mama, KNH waived the bills after you guys were aired here and I mentioned that. There are so many people in KNH complaining up to now that they haven’t received surgery yet and are in pain. We transferred 5 people from KNH to Nairobi West and they’re doing well,"" she wrote.
""KNH refused for people to be transferred after that and started politics. I requested you don’t charge them but you still follow people with bills at home! Usilete politics hapa wewe. Have some shame. You do not care.""
Further explaining her tribulations at the Kenyatta Hospital, Hanifa said that the hospital authorities were also refusing to transfer people, further complicating her efforts.
""Btw when I first visited KNH they sent out memos after that for people not to come visit without special orders,"" she said.
""Mind you they’re refusing to transfer people and I’m having a hard time helping them Kabisa!""
Hanifa, who helped raise Ksh.30 million from Kenyans, in a fund dubbed 'Care for the Injured', went on to share receipts and evidence of her efforts, asking the CS to quit ""playing politics"" with the life of Kenyans.
She added: ""Another fact check. We’ve been paying for Moi referral hospital, We’re paying for Embu Level 5 and other public hospitals as well. Even people in Mbagathi we visited them and we are waiting for the invoices. I’m repeating, do not play politics with people’s lives!""
Expressing her exasperation, Hanifa once again updated her followers, further explaining her frustrations with the Kenyatta Hospital but clarifying that she had been paying bills across various other hospitals.
""I already said the bill for KNH was waived after I aired them here. KNH refused for people to be transferred and they’re not letting us help either,"" she wrote.

Koyonzo Secondary School
rugby sevens head coach Eliud Okwemba has promised a comeback at the Western Region
Secondary Schools Ball Games after failing to defend their county title.
Okwemba has rued
overconfidence amongst his players and poor defending as the reasons for their loss
against St. Peter’s Mumias Boys High School in the semi-final.
St. Peter’s took advantage
of Koyonzo’s poor concentration in their backline to stun them 14-10 in a
thrilling semi-final clash, and book a final’s date with the newly crowned Kakamega
County champions Kakamega High School.
The Stormers enjoyed a
fine run last year, going all the way to the East Africa Secondary Schools
games and bagging the title without losing a single match to their Kenyan
counterparts.
But a defeat to St.
Peter’s Mumias must have been a perfect revenge for the Mumias-based
side after Koyonzo thumped them 21-10 in last year's Kakamega County final.
“Overconfidence was
our main undoing. My boys forgot that we have to deal with the competition at
the lower level before we can get to the regionals and nationals. It is
something that if we don’t tame will cost us,” said Okwemba.
“St. Peters prepared
well for the game, displayed a good game and punished us for our errors in
defending. We are working on that to ensure that we are perfect during the
regional school games,” he added.
Okwemba said they are
in the process of re-building following the departure of most of their players
from their title-winning squad, leaving them with just two players.
They are; Eric Simiyu
and Kevin Maicho, who are pivotal in their quest to win their third successive
title, although Simiyu remains sidelined after sustaining an injury.
“We have a new squad
and we are almost getting to the level we want. We are working around the clock
to ensure that they are in the best shape, and we are confident we shall reign
supreme in the Western Region School Games.”
Okwemba is keen to
outwit other regional giants like Kakamega High School, Butula and last year's
runners-up Vihiga High School to retain their title.
Kakamega, 2013
national champions, trounced St. Peter’s Mumias 12-5 to bag the Kakamega County
title, while Vihiga stunned Senende 22-0 to retain the Vihiga County title.
Butula, Busia County's
heavyweights, will have to wait after Busia County’s rugby sevens matches were
postponed to a later date.

US sprint star Noah Lyles has withdrawn from Friday's Monaco Diamond League meeting in order to finetune his preparations for the Paris Olympics, his management team said Wednesday.
Lyles, the reigning world 100m and 200m champion, had been due to run in the 200m at Friday's meeting at the Stade Louis II in Monaco.
However the 26-year-old said in a statement that he had opted to remain at his training camp in Florida for extra work as he builds towards the Olympics, where he is chasing a 100m-200m double.
""I'm sorry to announce that I've withdrawn from this Friday's Meeting Herculis EBS in Monaco,"" Lyles said in a statement.
""My coach, my entire team and I are very pleased with what we were able to achieve at the US Olympic Trials in Eugene, however, in order to put myself in the best possible position to succeed in Paris, we have decided to spend an extra week at our training base in Florida before traveling to Europe.
""I'll miss competing there on Friday, but I look forward to returning to race in Monaco next year.""
Lyles is the heavy favourite for the 200m at the Olympics and is the fastest man in the world over the distance this season with a leading time of 19.53sec set at the US Olympic trials last month.
He is the fourth fastest over the 100m this year with a best of 9.83sec, also set at the US trials.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/maintaining-10-wives-25-concubines-more-expensive-than-helicopter-didmus-barasa-claps-back-at-khalwale-n345159,"‘Maintaining 10 wives, 25 concubines more expensive than helicopter’: Didmus Barasa claps back at Khalwale
Kimilili Member of Parliament Didmus Barasa
has fired back at Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale over criticism for his alleged his display of wealth
and opulence.
Taking
to social media hours after the Senator called him out for public display of a
flashy lifestyle, Barasa in a bare-knuckle rejoinder slammed Khalwale saying he
is not in a position to afford a similar lifestyle due to his polygamous
nature.
The
outspoken Kimilili MP cited what he intimated to be Khalwale’s assets including a Nissan Patrol vehicle model and ownership of 35 houses, saying these are the reasons why he cannot
afford to own a chopper.
Barasa,
in his defence, asserted that contrary to the Senator's choice of being
polygamous, he has remained monogamous, which enables him to free up more cash
for such eccentricities as a helicopter.
“Senator
Boni Khalwale, I have heard you mention me in the Senate proceedings regarding
my purchase of a helicopter. Indeed, this is true. I made a choice between
having one wife, a helicopter and trusting in God. In contrast, you chose a
Nissan Patrol, ten wives, over twenty-five concubines, fathered forty-six known
children, and maintained 35 houses for hood rats across the country,” Barasa
wrote in a statement on X.
The
MP rubbished the Senator’s concerns terming them “misleading,” saying the
latter is in no position to lecture him on matters of wealth since being
polygamous is presumably more expensive than owning a helicopter.
“Maintaining
such a large family and numerous homes is exponentially more expensive than
having one wife, one helicopter, and three children. You're just an old
superficial and misleading fela,” stated Barasa.
During
Wednesday’s Senate proceedings, Khalwale criticised Barasa and other
politicians for their public display of wealth as Kenyans struggle with the
biting cost of living, saying the move was among the issues angering Kenyans
amid the ongoing anti-government protests.
“Didmus
Barasa, take it easy; helicopters will not change your life,” Khalwale told the
MP, who was recently reported to have acquired a multi-million-shilling chopper
that he uses to attend public functions.
Khalwale
went on to ask President William Ruto to investigate the flashy lifestyles of
his government's officials, even as he pledges austerity for his government in
the wake of the Finance Bill, 2024’s scrapping.
“The
President should ask himself how the membership of an MP to a committee in
Parliament can be the basis for him to be able to afford some of the things
that are not affordable,” said the Senator.
President
Ruto on Sunday promised to address the opulence and
extravagance displayed by some state officers, particularly Cabinet Secretaries
and MPs.
""I
promise you, watch this space. Going forward you will see changes because we
must do something about opulence and extravagance. We are going to take
measures that will put us in the right place,"" Ruto said in a media
roundtable interview at State House in Nairobi.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/sudanese-political-factions-meet-in-cairo-with-little-prospect-of-peace-n345384,"Sudanese political factions meet in Cairo with little prospect of peace
During the conference the Democratic Bloc, which is aligned with the army, refused to hold joint sessions with Taqaddum faction, which it accuses of sympathising with the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Neither the army nor the RSF attended.
The war in Sudan, which erupted in April 2023, has forced almost 10 million people from their homes, sparked warnings of famine and waves of ethnically-driven violence blamed largely on the RSF.
The force this week swept through the state of Sennar, causing new displacement. In response, army head General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan said the army would not negotiate with the RSF or its supporters.
""The stark deterioration in the humanitarian situation and the catastrophic consequences of this crisis, call on all of us to work to immediately and sustainably to stop military operations,"" said newly-appointed Egyptian foreign minister Badr Abdelatty.
Talks in Jeddah between the army and RSF that were sponsored by the United States and Saudi Arabia broke down at the end of last year.
Taqaddum is a coalition of pro-democracy parties, armed groups, and civil society that has called for an end to the war. The army-aligned Democratic Bloc includes several armed group leaders participating in the fighting.
While Egypt was able to wield its influence to assemble the group, the main attendees were seated at opposite sides of the hall at the conference's opening.
The two political factions agreed only to form a small subcommittee to come up with a final communique calling for an end to the war, which three Democratic Bloc leaders with forces fighting alongside the army did not sign.
""We told them [the Egyptians] not to have high ambitions for this meeting,"" Finance Minister Jibril Ibrahim told Reuters. He along with Darfur governor Minni Minawi and Sovereign Council deputy Malik Agar did not sign the communique.
""Given the situation on the ground, if we sit and eat and drink and laugh with the people who are allied and partners in the crimes that are happening we would be sending the wrong message to our citizens and to our soldiers,"" he said.
He added that an end to the war was not realistic without the withdrawal of the RSF from civilian areas, in line with an agreement signed in Jeddah last year, and the end of material support to the RSF by the United Arab Emirates. U.N. experts have said that accusations of such support are credible though the UAE has denied them.
Former Prime Minister and Taqaddum head Abdalla Hamdok rejected accusations that the coalition was linked to the RSF, saying he awaited the army's agreement to meet.
""A crisis this complicated and deep is not expected to end in one meeting... The lesson is for us to be patient and to build on anything positive that comes out of it,"" he told Reuters, echoing sentiments from diplomats at the meeting.
U.S. Special Envoy Tom Perriello said he hoped momentum from Saturday's talks would carry on to another meeting called by the African Union next week, another of several overlapping initiatives.

According to CS Kindiki, who spoke to Citizen TV's News Night, there was nothing unusual about plainclothes officers at the protests.
He argued that uniforms do not necessarily make police officers, dismissing concerns that gun-toting criminals could pose as uniformed police officers and shoot at the crowd.
""A police officer does not become a police officer because he is in uniform, a police officer becomes a police officer because he is a police officer,"" CS Kindiki said.
""We had police officers in uniform and others without and there is nothing irregular about that.""
According to CS Kindiki, crowd control is distinct from other types of policing activities and necessitates different tactics due to the nature of the engagement.
""Crowd control policing is different from other kinds of policing activities, including crime prevention,"" he added.

CS Kindiki stated that the events of the last few weeks demonstrate the high levels of organised crime as well as the high levels of opportunistic people taking advantage of protests.
Kenyans were outraged last week when a plainclothes police officer was caught on video shooting at the public from close range in Nairobi's Central Business District.
The video shows the officer, dressed in a black cap, blue shirt and grey trousers, firing his gun at a crowd that was standing calmly while he and his colleagues loaded arrested protesters into their van.
The shocking video, which was originally posted on TikTok and then shared across all other online platforms, shows police officers using brute force during the anti-Finance Bill protests.
There were numerous other incidents in which police officers were seen without uniforms, either engaging protesters or arresting them.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/bolivias-leader-general-accused-of-leading-failed-coup-wanted-to-be-president-n344910,"Bolivia's leader: General accused of leading failed coup wanted to be president
Bolivian President Luis Arce
said Friday a former general planned to ""take over"" the government
and become president in a failed coup, and he denied that the Andean nation was
in an economic crisis.
In an interview with The Associated Press, the embattled
leader denied once again that Wednesday's attack on the government palace was a
""self-coup"" designed to garner him political points.
""I didn't escape. I stayed to defend democracy,""
Arce said.
Arce washed his hands of claims by relatives of the 21 people
detained by the government that they were innocent of attempting a coup and had
been tricked by ex-Gen. Juan Jose Zúñiga.
""It's a problem of those who were involved, it's not the
government's problem,"" Arce told AP.
Arce said also his government has been ""politically
attacked"" by his one-time ally turned rival, former President Evo Morales,
saying the infighting has snarled legislative activities and hamstrung his
government confronting economic problems.
Despite that, he said, Bolivia's economy is growing and his administration is working to ""diversify"" means of producing, investing in things like lithium and industrializing.
Bolivia has the largest
reserves of lithium — a metal known as ""white gold"" and considered
essential in the green transition — in the world that has gone largely
untapped, in part due to government policy.
Arce said the government ""has taken action"" to
address intermittent gasoline and dollar shortages and other hurdles ailing the
South American nation's economy.
""Bolivia has an economy that's growing. An economy in
crisis doesn't grow,"" he said.
He said it was ""completely normal"" for Bolivians to
run to stockpile food in supermarkets and make a run on ATMs upon seeing an
emerging coup in the capital, instead of following his call to take to the
streets in support of the government.
He said Bolivians were traumatized by the political turmoil
in 2019 that led Morales to resign as president and flee and also caused 37
deaths.
""Where there is a political situation, this rupture, a
coup d'état, of course people will be scared that there won't be food … so
they'll go get money to go stock up,"" Arce said.
He added that the government was investigating if the attack was organized by the country's political opposition.
That same day, Arce's governmental minister, Eduardo del Castillo, said the government claimed that there were ""snipers who did not arrive in time to the Murillo square"" where the coup was staged.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/interior-cs-kindiki-clarifies-his-2020-there-is-going-to-be-a-war-speech-n345259,"Interior CS Kindiki clarifies his 2020 'there is going to be a war' speech
Interior Cabinet Secretary Prof. Kithure
Kindiki has come out to clarify a statement he made in 2020 in which he
seemingly asserted that an all-out war was going to break out in Kenya owing to
alleged administrative shortcomings of former President Uhuru Kenyatta's
government.
Kindiki made the utterances before the Senate
in his then capacity as Tharaka Nithi Senator, drawing parallels between Uhuru's
government and that of the Biblical king, Belshazzar.
Belshazzar was the son of Nabonidus and
grandson of the great Babylonian King, Nebuchadnezzar; history says that he
let that go to his head.
When Belshazzar succeeded his father, the
Persian empire attacked Babylon to challenge his status as King at a time the
kingdom was facing a severe famine.
Instead of taking his kingship seriously and
sparing basic supplies and fortifying his defenses, Belshazzar threw a huge
banquet in his name. Because of his hubris, Babylon fell to the Persian empire
in one night.
""Instead of being grateful that God had
honored him among millions of citizens to be their leader, he entertained a
government that was so divisive and oppressive. The Bible says he made a feast
where he entertained other important people. He even committed sacrilege
by using utensils taken from the temple of Jerusalem,"" said Kindiki on the
floor of the House then.
""Mr. Speaker, as they were enjoying and
making merry. As the deep state and system was celebrating, suddenly, there is
going to be a war in this country, there is going to be a writing on the
wall.""
Speaking on Citizen TV's ‘Tonight’ show on
Thursday, Kindiki clarified that when he made the remarks he said
""wall"" and not ""war"" in reference to Belshazzar's Biblical
story.
According to the Book of Daniel, when
Belshazzar and the ruling elite were fornicating and praising false gods at the
aforesaid banquet, a human hand appeared and inscribed the words 'Mene, Mene,
Tekel, Upharsin,' on the wall, which roughly translates to 'God has numbered
the days of your kingdom; you have been weighed in the balances and found
wanting.'
""There are two differences between my
speech in 2020 and what happened in June 25th (anti-government demos when
Kenyans raided Parliament). The first difference of course is that towards the
end of that clip, I said that there is going to be a ‘wall’; not war but
wall...because I was talking about the writing on the wall,"" the Interior
boss said.
Reflecting on the recent anti-government
demos, Kindiki asserted that it is imperative for the State to consider the
perspectives and grievances of Kenyans who took to the streets in protest of
the ruling Kenya Kwanza regime.
""It is the right of Kenyans to tell the
government what they think about that government. That is the basis of
democracy. Displeasure, disapproval, disaffection all those things are
democratic,"" he said.
""Citizens telling their government that
they think government officials are living large is within their rights. We are
listening and as you have seen from the President's interview on Sunday and
subsequent communications, the government is not only committed to listen to
the people of Kenya are saying but to implement every viable solution that can
make our country better.""

https://www.citizen.digital/news/govt-halts-all-public-service-recruitment-to-curb-rising-wage-bill-n345247,"Gov't halts all Public Service recruitment to curb rising wage Bill
This was revealed in a directive issued on Wednesday by Moses K. Kuria, Cabinet Secretary for Public Service, Performance, and Delivery Management.
He stated that the directive is consistent with the austerity measures discussed during Prof. Njuguna Ndung'u's Budget presentation on June 13.
Kuria emphasized the urgency of the directive in a letter to Amb. Anthony Muchiri, Chairperson of the Public Service Commission, writing, ""This measure is critical in controlling runaway recurrent expenditures and aligning with austerity measures across government.""
According to CS Kuria, Kenya's expenditure on public servant salaries, allowances, and benefits has exceeded sustainable levels, putting a strain on the country's finances.
“Our current expenditure on salaries, allowances, and benefits for public servants exceeds sustainable levels, placing undue strain on our national finances and hindering our ability to allocate resources towards essential national priorities,”Kuria noted,.
He stated that during the employment suspension, the government will conduct a comprehensive audit and clean-up of public payrolls.
“In view of expected budget cuts in the ongoing budget rationalization, therefore, I urge you to halt any new recruitment and any that is ongoing and has not been concluded.” the letter reads.
A tripartite committee will be formed to oversee and evaluate recruitment initiatives, with representatives from the Ministry of Public Service, Performance and Delivery Management, the Ministry of National Treasury and Economic Planning, and the Public Service Commission.
According to CS Kuria, future hiring in the public sector will be based solely on genuine operational requirements.
“All new and ongoing recruitment, including interviews for shortlisted candidates in public service, are to be halted immediately,” Kuria stated. “Any future hiring in the public sector must be justified by genuine operational needs.”
This measure, he contended, seeks to stabilise Kenya's economic situation and ensure that public-sector employment reflects the country's fiscal realities.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/what-is-hezbollah-the-iranian-backed-group-that-could-go-to-all-out-war-against-israel-n344907,"What is Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed group that could go to all-out war against Israel?
After more than eight months of low-scale conflict, Israel and the Lebanese
militant group Hezbollah are threatening all-out war.
The United States and the international community are
lobbying for calm and hopeful for a diplomatic solution. They have not been
successful so far and time for a political settlement could be expiring.
Should war break out, Israel would face a much more
formidable foe in Lebanon than it faced in Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah warned Israel last week
that his group has new weapons and capabilities, and it has published surveillance
drone footage taken deep inside northern Israel that showed the port of Haifa
and other sites far from the Lebanon-Israel border.
A look at how Hezbollah became what many call the strongest
non-state force in the region.
Founded in 1982 during Lebanon's civil war, Hezbollah's
initial objective was ending Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon. It
achieved that in 2000.
Shiite Muslim Hezbollah is part of a collection of Iranian-backed factions and governments known as the Axis of Resistance.
It was the first group that Iran backed and used as a way
to export its brand of political Islamism.
In its early days the group attacked U.S. targets, causing
Washington to designate it a terrorist organization.
""Iran's support has helped Hezbollah consolidate its
position as Lebanon's most powerful political actor as well as the
most-equipped military actor supported by Iran in the whole of the Middle
East,"" said Lina Khatib, the director of the SOAS Middle East Institute in
London.
Hezbollah fighters ambushed an Israeli patrol in 2006 and
took two Israeli soldiers hostage. Hezbollah and Israel fought a month-long war
that ended in a draw but Israeli bombardment wreaked widespread destruction in
southern Lebanon.
Israel's objective was eliminating Hezbollah but the Lebanese
group came out stronger and became a key military and political power on
Israel's northern border.
Domestic opponents have criticized Hezbollah for maintaining its arsenal and for coming to dominate the government.
Hezbollah's reputation also suffered when it briefly
seized a section of Beirut in May 2008 after the Lebanese government took
measures against its private telecommunications network.
Hezbollah's military capabilities have also surged, and it
has played a key role in the Syrian civil war, keeping President Bashar
al-Assad in power. And it has helped train Iran-backed militias in Syria and
Iraq, as well as Yemen's Houthi rebels.
Throughout its latest conflict with Israel, Hezbollah has
gradually introduced new weapons to its arsenal, especially after Israel began
its ground invasion of the southern city of Rafah in Gaza in early May.
While Hezbollah initially began launching Cornet anti-tank missiles and salvos of Katyusha rockets, it later started using rockets with heavy warheads, and eventually introduced explosive drones and surface-to-air missiles for the first time.
Nasrallah said the drones are locally manufactured, with
many at their disposal.
The group notably released the two videos of footage from
drones over Haifa and other sites in northern Israel, showing critical civilian
and military infrastructure in a move intended to showcase new access and
capabilities and deter Israeli attack.
In a televised address last week, Nasrallah said that the
group will continue resorting to this tactic.
""We now have new weapons. But I won't say what they
are,"" he said. ""When the decision is made, they will be seen on the
front lines.""
How does Hezbollah compare to other Iranian-backed
groups?
Hezbollah is the Arab world's most significant paramilitary
force with a robust internal structure as well as a sizeable arsenal. Israel
sees it as its most direct threat, and estimates that it has an arsenal of 150,000
rockets and missiles, including precision-guided missiles.
In recent years, Hezbollah sent forces to Syria to help
fellow Iranian ally President Bashar Assad against armed opposition groups. It
also supported the growth of Iranian-backed militias in Iraq, Yemen and Syria.
Khatib of the SOAS Middle East Institute in London likened
Hezbollah to a ""big brother"" of fledgling Iranian-backed groups that
""do not enjoy the same level of infrastructure or discipline.""
Hezbollah is bound to Iran by doctrine. However, its
relationship with Hamas, an offshoot of the Sunni Muslim Brotherhood movement,
is based on pragmatism.
In recent years, some Hamas officials, including its former second-in-command, Saleh al-Arouri, have since moved to Lebanon, where they have Hezbollah's protection and a presence across Lebanon's multiple Palestinian refugee camps.
Arouri was killed in an Israeli drone strike in a
southern Beirut suburb in January.
Born in 1960 into a poor Shiite family in the Beirut suburb
of Bourj Hammoud and later displaced to south Lebanon, Nasrallah studied
theology and joined the Amal movement, a Shiite political and paramilitary
organization, before becoming one of Hezbollah's founders.
He became Hezbollah's leader in 1992 after his predecessor
was killed in an Israeli strike.
Idolized by many for presiding over Israel's withdrawal from the south and leading the 2006 war, his image appears on billboards and on gadgets in souvenir shops in Lebanon, Syria and other countries across the Arab world.
But he also faces opposition among Lebanese who accuse
him of tying their country's fate to Iran.
Nasrallah is also considered to be pragmatic, able to make
political compromises.
He has lived in hiding for years, fearing Israeli assassination, and delivers his speeches from undisclosed locations.

In a statement, Wetangula said that the sanctity of Parliament precincts was violated when Kenyan youth stormed and caused chaos in the premises.
""Indeed, our sacred institution faced a grievous breach of security and an unforgivable act of violence. The events that transpired during the invasion have shaken us to the core resulting in the loss of lives close to the precincts of Parliament,"" said Wetangula.
He termed them as people masquerading as peaceful protestors and sought to reign terror on the hallowed grounds.
""Honourable Members, as your Speaker and Chairperson of the Parliamentary Service Commission effects of the invasion of Parliament, the gory images of the wanton distraction of property, and the desecration of the Parliamentary square by people ""masquerading"" as youth and peaceful protesters, who reigned terror on Parliament and forcefully made their way in these hallowed grounds. It is highly regrettable,"" Wetangula remarked.
""I stand before you with a heavy heart and it is my solemn duty to address the gravity of what has occurred. The sanctity of Parliament has been violated, lives have been needlessly lost and the foundation of our democracy has been tested in ways we never imagined. On behalf of the Parliamentary Service Commission and on my own behalf, I send my condolences to the families and friends of the departed souls and wish those who are in various hospitals quick recovery.""
He noted that Kenyans ought to have exercised restraint and carry out the protests without interfering with other activities and non-protestors.
The speaker advocated for mutual discussions in line with the law to enable everyone to coexist.
""Violence, disrespect and wanton destruction of property and blatant attack on public institutions shall not be condoned. I am not a stranger to the conversations that have been going on in this country with regards to the Finance Bill and the general state of the economy of the Nation. I laud the youth of this nation for taking the lead in this discourse and what a privilege to be alive at such a time as this to behold our children engage in and shape the course of our nation,"" he added.
He appealed to Kenyans to accommodate each other and work towards a peaceful future by upholding the democratic values in the Constitution.
The remarks were, however, met with criticism from Kenyans online who questioned why the lawmakers did not heed the cries of the public.
""Those institutions are meant to serve the people. What happens when those inside have cotton wool in their ears?""
""What is honorable about the people cosying up themselves in their every day expecting to be called mhesh? What does it it mean to honor/heshimu? I never refer any of you in that title unless you truly deserve it as per my own discernment.""
""This 2024 not like those years of threats, we shall still come back again and again,"" read some of the comments online.

President William Ruto has mourned High
Court Judge David Majanja as an intellectual lawyer of integrity.
Justice Majanja passed away at a Nairobi
hospital while receiving treatment after surgery on Wednesday evening.
In a Thursday post on X, Ruto said
Majanja was a brilliant lawyer whose integrity and ability inspired the
judicial fraternity.
“The Hon. Majanja was a brilliant lawyer
who joined the Bench after an exemplary spell at the Bar. His integrity and
ability inspired the confidence of his colleagues, while his powerful intellect
made him a trusted juridical voice,” wrote the President.
“It has been evident for long that although
fairly experienced, Hon. Majanja was at the beginning of a long and illustrious
career, and this fact makes his passing all the more tragic.”
He extended his condolences to Justice Majanja’s
family, friends and the Judiciary, adding: “May Almighty God grant you the
strength to bear this loss, and may his soul rest in eternal peace.”
Justice Majanja’s death was announced by
Chief Justice Martha Koome, who termed him “a towering figure in the
development of our transformative post-2010 jurisprudence and a crucial pillar”
of the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) as well as the Judiciary at large.
Majanja was appointed judge of the High
Court in 2011 and has served in Homa Bay, Migori, Kisumu and Kisii.
He also served at the Commercial and Tax
Divisions and was, at the time of his death, stationed at the Milimani High
Court Civil Division.
The judge was on May 25, 2024, re-elected
as a member of the JSC representing the Kenya Magistrates and Judges
Association (KMJA), having been first elected to the commission on May 14, 2019,
for a five-year term.
Before his re-election, Justice Majanja
served as the Chairperson of the Human Resource Management Committee and was
also a member of the Audit, Governance and Risk Management Committee and
Learning and Development Committee.
He held a Master of Laws degree from the
University of Pretoria in South Africa and a Bachelor of Laws from the
University of Nairobi.

Published on: July 11, 2024 11:46 (EAT)
Netherlands' head coach Ronald Koeman reacts at the end of the UEFA Euro 2024 semi-final football match between the Netherlands and England at the BVB Stadion in Dortmund on July 10, 2024. (Photo by INA FASSBENDER / AFP)
Netherlands coach Ronald Koeman admitted his team's 2-1 Euro 2024 semi-final defeat against England on Wednesday was ""hard to accept"" after a controversial penalty decision and then a last-gasp Ollie Watkins goal left his team floored.
""I am disappointed about the final result in a match which started really good for us,"" Koeman told reporters at the Westfalenstadion in Dortmund, where the Dutch had taken an early lead on the night through a brilliant goal by Xavi Simons.
Harry Kane quickly equalised from the penalty in question, but the match was seemingly heading for extra time before substitute Watkins struck in the 91st minute to send England through to a final against Spain.
England's penalty came just after the quarter-hour mark when Kane sent a shot over the bar and was caught on the follow-through by Denzel Dumfries.
Contact was minimal and seemingly innocuous, but German referee Felix Zwayer pointed to the spot after coming over to the VAR monitor.
""What can you do as a defender? In my opinion this shouldn't have been a penalty,"" Koeman complained.
""We cannot play football properly and that is due to VAR. It breaks football.""
Koeman felt his team had been in control after the 35th-minute introduction of midfielder Joey Veerman for the injured Memphis Depay, which allowed them to stem the tide of England attacks.
""We had some difficulties in the midfield to stop the good players like (Jude) Bellingham and (Phil) Foden between the lines,"" he said.
""We didn't control the game. We made some changes to get control back and the feeling was that in the last 20 minutes we were the better team and attacking more.
""But then came the knockout on 90 minutes. A great goal, and then it's over, and that is difficult to accept.""
Koeman, 61, returned for a second spell as Netherlands coach following the 2022 World Cup, when Louis van Gaal took the team to the last eight in Qatar.
Their run in Germany is their best performance at a European Championship since 2004, when they also went out in the semi-finals.
""We should be proud, we've achieved many things in these weeks,"" insisted Koeman, whose team notably missed injured Barcelona playmaker Frenkie de Jong at the tournament.
""This team is able to do more. And moreover, there are also players who will join us in the future.
""Some were not able to play because they were not fit, so there's a future for us.
""We have to improve some aspects, but we were close to the final.""
The Dutch had been hoping to go to Berlin for a final against Spain that would have been a repeat of the denouement of the 2010 World Cup.
Instead they go home to their next assignment: a double-header of UEFA Nations League games in September against Bosnia and Herzegovina and Germany.
Koeman meanwhile believes England can compete with Spain in the final on Sunday.
""I think England showed great football in the first half after going 1-0 down,"" he said of their performance in Dortmund.
""England are in the final and they have possibilities to win it. Spain are playing on a high level, but England can stop them, why not.""

Kenya’s national women’s
volleyball team, Malkia Strikers, are back from the Philippines where they were
knocked out of the FIVB Challenger Cup.
Kenya lost by three
straight sets to Puerto Rico in the quarter-finals on Thursday, July 4, 2024,
finishing in fifth place above Sweden, hosts Philippines, and Argentina.
Malkia Strikers were
stifled 25-20, 25-19, and a close 27-25 to exit the tournament.
Puerto Ricans started the
match strongly, thrashing Malkia Strikers 25-20 in the first set and 25-19 in
the second set.
In the third set, despite
Kenya’s hard fight the Puerto Ricans dismissed them 27-25 ultimately winning
the match in straight sets.
Outside hitter Pamela Adhiambo
made an impressive international debut scoring 22 points for her team, which were
however not enough to save her teammates the blushes.
“For the game that we had
the Challenger Cup, I think that one was an eye-opener match for us, as we gear
up for the Olympics and we are going to improve on the best performances that
we had. We are going to try our best so that we can give a competitive display,
and we promise the Kenyans that all shall be well with us,” stated Adhiambo.
Despite Kenya’s straight-sets
loss to the eventual winners, Adhiambo emerged as the tournament’s second top
scorer, highlighting her remarkable talent and potential on the global stage.
Malkia Strikers are now
gearing up for the 2024 Paris Olympics, with a three-week training camp in
Miramas, Southern France before the games begin from July 26 to August 11,
2024.
In Paris, Kenya has been
placed in a tough Group B alongside two-time Olympic champions Brazil and
Japan, and two-time Olympics bronze medalists, Poland.
It will be an uphill task
for Kenya as they will be seeking to revenge on their disappointing losses to
Brazil and Japan, who handed them severe beatings at the Tokyo 2020 Games.
Malkia Strikers secured
Africa’s sole ticket to the Summer Games, by winning the African Nations Championships
held in Cameroon and clinching their record extending tenth
continental title.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/kenya-ordered-to-pay-ksh10m-to-family-of-slain-pakistani-journalist-arshad-sharif-n345432,"Kenya ordered to pay Ksh.10M to family of slain Pakistani journalist Arshad Sharif
High court judge Stella Mutuku ruled on Monday morning that Sharif's murder was unconstitutional and that his rights to life and protection were violated.
Sharif's family, led by his widow Javeria Siddique, sued the government for their kin's killing, arguing that he had the right to be protected and was wrongfully killed.
The state has however asked the court to suspend the ruling for at least 30 days to allow them to file an appeal which the court granted.
Sharif, who had fled Pakistan citing threats to his life, was shot dead by Kenyan police in Nairobi on October 23, 2022.
Kenyan officials said it was a case of mistaken identity and police hunting car thieves opened fire on his vehicle as it drove through a roadblock without stopping.
A two-member fact-finding team set up by the Pakistani government to probe the killing said it found several contradictions in the version given by Kenyan authorities, and believed it was a case of pre-planned murder.
The team travelled to Kenya and conducted a number of interviews, examined and reconstructed the crime scene and examined the deceased's phones and computers.
""Both the members of the (fact-finding team) have a considered understanding that it is a case of planned targeted assassination with transnational characters rather than a case of mistaken identity,"" said the report, copies of which were submitted to Pakistan's Supreme Court.
""It is more probable that the firing was done, after taking proper aim, at a stationary vehicle,"" it said.
Kenyan authorities declined to comment on the specifics of the report.
""The investigation into the matter is still ongoing, so there is not much I can tell,"" said Kenya National Police Service spokesperson Resila Onyango.
CASE OF TREASON
Sharif had fled from Pakistan citing threats to his life after the government registered several treason cases against him.
One of the treason cases stemmed from reporting Sharif did that led to an accusation he had spread a call from an official in a previous government, led by former cricket star Imran Khan, for members of the armed forces to mutiny.
Both Sharif and the official in the previous government denied inciting mutiny.
Former prime minister Khan said Sharif had been murdered for his journalistic work. He and his successor Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, not related to the journalist, had called for a judicial investigation.
The fact-finding team's report also pointed out apparent contradictions in the autopsy reports in Kenya and Pakistan.
The post-mortem report in Pakistan identified 12 injuries on Sharif's body whereas the Kenyan report identified just two injuries pertaining to gunshot wounds.
The team's report also said that doctors believed the injuries may be the result of torture or a struggle, but it could not be established until verified by the doctor who conducted the post-mortem in Kenya.

Human rights groups on Saturday called for
the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) to investigate cases
of police brutality during the anti-Finance Bill protests.
In a joint
public statement to IPOA Chairperson Anne Makori, the organizations noted with concern how law enforcement officers
used excessive force thereby inflicting injuries and killing peaceful protesters
who were unarmed.
They said
they have so far documented 23 deaths, 34 disappearances and 271 injuries
during the protests, calling for the officers responsible to be held
accountable and prosecuted.
“Article 21
of the ICCPR and Article 37 of the Kenyan Constitution safeguards the basic
right to peaceful assembly. It is unfortunate that law officers used excessive
force, inflicting injuries and even killing peaceful protesters rather than
defending this right,” the statement read in part.
“The UN
Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials
state that lethal force should only be used in extreme cases and when necessary
to defend life. Such acts constitute a clear breach of this principle.”
The 20 human
rights groups included Amnesty International Kenya, Defenders Coalition,
Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA-Kenya), Independent Medical Legal Unit (IMLU),
International Centre for Transitional Justice (ICTJ), International Justice
Mission (IJM), Kariobangi Paralegal Network and Katiba Institute.
Others were;
Kenya Human Rights Commission (KHRC), Kenyans for Peace, Truth and Justice (KPTJ),
Shield for Justice Foundation, Social Justice Centres Working Group (SJCW),
Social Welfare Development Program (SOWED), Transparency International Kenya,
Usalama Reforms Forum, Wangu Kanja Foundation and Women Empowerment Link.
They also
expressed concern over the deployment of the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) across all 47 counties, noting that the situation could worsen in the coming days.
The groups
reiterated that rogue security officers contravened the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights, to which Kenya is a signatory.
“The UN
Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials
state that lethal force should only be used in extreme cases and when necessary
to defend life. Such acts constitute a clear breach of this principle,” the
statement added.
“We thus
implore the Independent Police Oversight Authority (IPOA) to investigate these
instances expeditiously and in great detail.”
The human
rights groups called for IPOA to update the public on the progress of the
investigations within seven days.

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/slot-unfazed-by-pressure-of-replacing-klopp-at-liverpool-n345294,"Slot unfazed by pressure of replacing Klopp at Liverpool
Published on: July 05, 2024 08:44 (EAT)

Liverpool's new manager Arne Slot insists he can cope with the pressure of following in the footsteps of Anfield icon Jurgen Klopp.
Slot has the daunting task of trying to emulate Klopp's remarkably successful nine-year reign at Liverpool.
Before his shock decision to step down at the end of last season, Klopp led Liverpool to a host of major trophies, including their first Premier League title in 30 years and the Champions League crown in 2019.
Slot is tasked with maintaining the sky-high standards set by Klopp and the 45-year-old Dutchman is confident he can rise to the challenge.
Speaking at his first press conference since his arrival from Feyenoord in June, Slot was asked if it was intimidating to follow Klopp.
""Not at all actually. You can look at it both ways, big shoes to fill but you inherit a squad that has a winning culture. One of the reasons to come here is I do feel we are a real good squad,"" he said.
""You want to work at a club with an opportunity to win something, the past has shown there is an opportunity to win trophies.
""When he arrived he said he was the normal one but it was anything but normal. What was special was what he left behind, winning trophies and the style of play.
""Yes I'm following someone who was really successful but there are really good players here and I like to work with them.""
Slot, who won 98 of his 150 games with Feyenoord, is Liverpool's 21st permanent manager.
He joins the Reds at an intriguing time, with Klopp leaving a squad that finished nine points behind Premier League champions Manchester City after collapsing in the final weeks of the title race.
Liverpool won the League Cup in Klopp's farewell season but his overhaul of a team that had grown old under his leadership is likely to remain a work in progress in Slot's first season.
""There were a few new signings last year. The longer they play together the more they will improve,"" Slot said.
""If you work in this league everyone gets better every season. It's important to improve. It's normal if you work in the biggest league in the world.""
With City having won the Premier League in six of the last seven seasons and Arsenal emerging as their strongest challengers, Slot faces a tough task to emulate Klopp's 2020 title triumph.
Klopp's rivalry with City boss Pep Guardiola provided some of the defining moments of his Liverpool reign.
But Slot, who led Feyenoord to the Dutch title in 2023 but finished in second place last season, wisely opted against any bold declarations when asked about the prospect of pitting wits with Guardiola.
""I've seen a lot of that rivalry. It's something to look forward to but I think there are many other good managers here. Pep is one of them for sure,"" he said.
Slot's commitment to an attacking, high-tempo style similar to Klopp's game-plan was significant in the decision to hire him.
But he intends to be his own man, rather than copying the motivational ploys of the charismatic and emotional Klopp.
""It is nothing to do with being the successor to Jurgen. It is part of the job. I don't think 'what would he say'. I think how to get the best out of the team,"" Slot said.
And while Klopp's relationship with the city of Liverpool was love at first sight, Slot will take a more pragmatic approach.
""It takes some time to understand everything. It helps to know the city but as a manager it helps more to win your games,"" he said
""Our styles are similar. We both like the fans to come and see a team that plays with a lot of energy and good football.
""That's the thing I'm focused on first. If we do that, it will give me some time and then I can get to know the city better.""

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/fkf-has-irrationally-delayed-womens-cup-final-says-wambua-n344840,"FKF has irrationally delayed Women’s Cup final, says Wambua
Ulinzi Starlets tactician Joseph Wambua has blamed the
Football Kenya Federation (FKF) for postponing the FKF Women’s Cup final saying
it will interfere with their pre-season plans.
Wambua led the soldiers to the FKF Women’s Cup final after edging
out the recent crowned Kenya Women Premier League (KWPL) champions Kenya Police
Bullets 4-2 via post-match penalties on May 4 at the Dandora Stadium.
They thus booked a date with Kibera Soccer Ladies who in their
side saw off Bernard Kitolo’s Zetech Sparks 2-1 in the other semifinal, but
their Cup finale has been delayed, leaving Wambua bothered.
Wambua who resumed her duties a month ago after a long illness,
said it is not making sense that they will play the final two months after semis.
“We have waited for the final for the longest time despite playing
the semis in May 4th. It has impacted the players negatively because they have
waited for so long and also it means the season will end in July which translates
to limited timeto prepare for the next season. It’s almost two months now since
we played our semis and I’m wondering why the final should be postponed for
that long,” he wondered.
The final was earlier slated for June 16, but had to pushed
forward to allow the national side U17 (Junior Starlets) to play their World
Cup qualifier matches which they qualified by defeating Burundi in an aggregate
of 5-0 in the fourth and final round.
Wambua however remained confident that they will successfully
defend the FKF Cup this season, which would be their third in a row.
“We are well prepared for the final. The only major injury doubt I
had was for Diana Shakava but she has since recovered well. We will give Kibera
Soccer the respect they deserve considering that they managed third position in
the cup last season so they will be aiming a better finish. I’m urging my
players to stay focused ahead of the final and I believe having done it for the
last two editions, we shall win it for the third time in a row.”
Zetech Sparks and Kenya Police Bullets will face off in the
third-place play off that will curtain raise the final on July 6.

Over 20 people are reported to have died in the protest which left thousands injured. As a result, former President Daniel Moi’s government bowed to pressure and allowed political pluralism.
34 years later, SabaSaba remains a historic day for Kenya. However, the 2024 SabaSaba day has taken a new course as organisers dedicate it to commemoration of Kenyans killed during the recent anti-government protests.
Data from the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR) shows that at least 39 people were killed in the nationwide protests that occurred June 18 to July 1, 2024. It further reported 32 cases of abductions and 627 arrests of protesters.
As a result, a section of Kenyans have organized a march to commemorate those who lost their lives through gun shots and other forms of violence meted towards the protesters.
On the other hand, a memorial concert is set to be held at Uhuru Park grounds in Nairobi.
The concert, organized by activist Boniface Mwangi and others will bring together top Kenyan artists to honour Kenyans killed during the protests.
It is set to take place from 12 pm to 7 pm.
Siaya Governor James Orengo, who was among the Young Turks leading the 1990 SabaSaba day has hailed the youthful population for upholding democracy on the historic day.
"" I am happy because the young people of this country have decided to march for their lives. I support you! I support your clarion calls of saying NO to dictatorship, NO to tribalism in state appointments, NO to police brutality, NO to corruption. I urge you to remain vigilant and steadfast because freedom is coming,"" Orengo said on Sunday.
ANTI-GOVERNMENT PROTESTS
What began as a protest against the Finance Bill 2024 has led Kenyans to unleash lists of demands to the Kenya Kwanza government.
On June 26, President William Ruto bowed to pressure from protesters and refused to sign the Finance Bill into law.
The move was after deadly protests, where Kenyans invaded parliament after legislators voted in favour of the contentious Bill.
After rejecting the Bill, President William Ruto announced austerity measures to reduce government expenditure.
Some of the measures include scrapping of budgets in the office of the First Lady, spouse of Deputy President and Prime Cabinet Secretary.
Other measures include suspension of the appointment of Chief Administrative Officers (CASs) and dissolution of 47 State Corporations that have overlapping mandates.

Last week, social media reports alleged that a female doctor was shot at by police officers and was pronounced dead upon arrival at the hospital.
KMPDU Secretary-General Davji Atellah, however, clarified that a lady named Margaret Obuya was mistakenly identified as a doctor as she was in the process of buying drugs at Transchem Chemist in the CBD during the protests.
He revealed that she was hit by a teargas canister and later admitted for emergency treatment at Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) for her injuries. Atellah confirmed that she has since been discharged and is currently recuperating at home.

Poland needs to prepare its soldiers for all-out conflict, its armed forces chief of staff said on Wednesday, as the country boosts the number of troops on its border with Russia and Belarus.
Poland's relations with Russia and its ally Belarus have deteriorated sharply since Moscow sent tens of thousands of troops into neighbouring Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, starting a war that is still being fought.
""Today, we need to prepare our forces for full-scale conflict, not an asymmetric-type conflict,"" army chief of staff General Wieslaw Kukula told a press conference.
""This forces us to find a good balance between the border mission and maintaining the intensity of training in the army,"" he said.
Speaking at the same event, deputy defence minister Pawel Bejda said that as of August, the number of troops guarding Poland's eastern border would be increased to 8,000 from the current 6,000, with an additional rearguard of 9,000 able to step up within 48 hours notice.
In May, Poland announced details of ""East Shield"", a 10 billion zloty ($2.5 billion) programme to beef up defences along its border with Belarus and Russia, which it plans to complete the plans by 2028.
The border with Belarus has been a flashpoint since migrants started flocking there in 2021 after Belarus opened travel agencies in the Middle East offering a new unofficial route into Europe - a move the European Union said was designed to create a crisis.
Warsaw has ramped up defence spending to more that 4% of its economic output this year in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Kukula also said the current high interest from candidates to join the army posed a dilemma over whether to take in more recruits than budgeted for at the expense of military equipment procurement, especially as he said interest was expected to start declining sharply from 2027.
The size of the armed forces stood at about 190,000 personnel at the end of last year, including ground, air, naval, special forces and territorial defence forces.
Poland plans to increase this to 300,000 troops within a few years.

Kenya Police Bullets on Wednesday were officially
crown the 2023/2024 Kenyan Women Premier League champions after defeating
Bunyore Starlets 3-0 in a season finale match played at Jomo Kenyatta Stadium
Mamboleo in Kisumu.
It is their maiden title since the renaming from
Thika Queens, and they had been declared champions with a game to spare on May
25 after amassing an unassailable 46 points following a 6-2 win against Zetech
Sparks.
The Beldine Odemba-coached side were crowned winners
after topping the table charts on 49 points after 22 rounds, five points above
Ulinzi Starlets and former champions Vihiga Queens respectively.
Mercy Njeri got the law enforcers off the blocks in
the 19th minute and then Rebeccah Okwaro grabbed a brace in the 74th and 76th
minutes respectively to wind up the season in style.
Police were to harvest the first goal early in the
tenth minute through Lucy Kwekwe but her shot went wide.
In the 32nd minute, Lydiah Akoth also had a chance
to extend the law enforcers lead but her shot on target was well cleared by
Bunyore Keeper Alice Ochanji.
Starlets had their first scoring chance in the 35th
minute through Bracksides Itambo but her shot was cleared by Bullets keeper
Mishi Mbaru.
In the second half, Odemba introduced Agnes Olesi
and Mercy Masika as Puren Alukwe went out, something which seemed to work well.
In the 61st minute Mercy Njeri delivered a clear foul but it was well cleared
by Bunyore the defenders.
Bunyore in their side continued pressing hard and in
the 54th minute Janet Asewe shot from a distance but her shot went wide.
Ulinzi Starlets have finished the season in the
second position with 44 after demolishing Bungoma Queens 10-0 at Ulinzi Sports
Complex in Nairobi while former champions Vihiga Queens, who went down 4-1 in
the hands of Wadadia, finished third with 44 points same to Ulinzi with
inferior goal difference.
Match between Kibera Soccer Ladies and Madira Soccer Assassins which was to be played at the Wolves Den in Kajiado was postponed due to security reasons and has been rescheduled to mid next week.
Kenya Police Bullets also finished the 2023/2024 season unbeaten.
The law enforcers will now shift their focus to the Caf Champions League Cecafa qualifiers slated for August in Ethiopia.
In the battle for top scorer award, Tumaini Waliaula clinched the golden boot with 16 goals, while Kenya Police Bullets Purity Alukwe and Rebecca Okwaro tied for second position with 15 goals each.
Meanwhile, the team that will drop to the 2023/24
FKF Women National Super League between Soccer Assassins and Zetech Sparks will be known on Saturday, June 29.
This delay is due to Soccer Assassins v Kibera Soccer Ladies match being rescheduled for safety reasons amid ongoing
protests.
Currently, Zetech Sparks are three points ahead of
Soccer Assassins and have a -10 goal difference.
With no more games to play, they hope Soccer
Assassins do not win their match at Wolves Den, Kajiado. A 7-0 win for Soccer
Assassins against fourth-placed Kibera Soccer Ladies FC is the only way for
them to secure their place in the FKFWPL 2024/25 season.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/gachaguas-speech-was-a-threat-on-loss-of-more-lives-ekuru-aukot-n344772,"Gachagua's speech was a threat on loss of more lives - Ekuru Aukot
This is after Gachagua on Wednesday urged Kenyan youth to cancel their planned protests to occupy State House today, Thursday 27, ""so that we don't have further loss of lives and destruction of property.""
""As Deputy president and patriotic son, I want to appeal to Gen Z to call off the protests for tomorrow because their cry has been heard by the president. He has accepted that there was a disconnect and it is only fair we call off the protests,"" Gachagua added.
In Aukot's view, the sentiments made by Gachagua pose an alarming threat to human lives, arguing that he hinted at possible police brutality if the youth take the streets.
""When I listen to Gachagua I read a threat. Why would he be insinuating that we do not want to lose more lives is it because they do not understand the constitution of Kenya that Kenyans can demonstrate peaceably,"" he said.
""Police should actually give protection to that peaceful demonstration. Why is he insinuating on loss of lives? I don't really buy into what he is saying.""
Aukot further noted that more individuals should be held responsible for those shot dead by police officers during the peaceful protests that later turned chaotic after officers started opening fire.
""Let's see some heads rolling. Can IG Koome take responsibility for what happened or that Nairobi regional commander,"" Aukot noted.
""Lives were lost, we have dead bodies. Somebody is responsible for that, who is that person because those young people were very peaceful.""
After vehement protests that happened in three days, the government finally bowed to pressure and President William Ruto announced that he would not sign the contentious Finance Bill 2024 and referred it back to Parliament for withdrawal.
""Having reflected on the continuing conversation around the content of the finance bill of 2024, I will decline to assent to the bill,"" President Ruto said on Wednesday evening.
What next?
According to Article 115 of the Constitution, the president has two options 14 days after receiving the bill: sign it into law or refer it back to Parliament for amendments.
If the head of state returns the bill to Parliament, MPs must either amend it after adopting the president's recommendations or pass it again without amendments. This should be done with a two-thirds majority in the National Assembly.
Clause 6 of the Constitution states that if the president refuses to sign the bill and fails to return it to Parliament within 14 days, the bill will be considered law.
This means that Ruto must write a letter to parliament within 14 days recommending that the bill be rejected in its entirety; otherwise, the bill will become law.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/senator-aaron-cheruiyot-urges-legislators-to-reject-salary-increment-n345117,"Senator Aaron Cheruiyot urges legislators to reject salary increment
While making his address at the Senate, Cheruiyot questioned why the SRC has remained silent during the anti-government protests, instead of forwarding solutions that would resolve the country's economic woes.
He added that public officers including Members of Parliament have no option but to take pay cuts to reduce the ballooning wage bill.
""SRC has been silent during these protests. They have to speak and tell us what is it that we do to reduce the wage bill from 46 per cent to mandatory 35 per cent. If it means taking a pay cut, we as members of parliament have been told that we will never do it. We don’t have an option, we must do it,"" he said.
""The yearly increment that is being discussed, I saw it being reported or misreported that we are now going to earn more; SRC continues to be silent about it. We must make a resolution and say that we reject even that one in light of the financial situation.""
Cheruiyot noted that the senators convened for a session on Tuesday off-camera where they discussed issues affecting the country. He noted that the Wednesday morning session aimed at addressing the issues and forwarding radical solutions to the country.
""We had a session yesterday afternoon off-camera where we sat down and reasoned and said what can we make as a contribution. We're deeply embarrassed that it has taken young children to point to us that we're naked as leaders,"" he remarked.
""I realised we're in extraordinary times and ordinary solutions cannot work this time unless we're serious and honest. We have come up with this motion which is just but the beginning of guiding our country towards solutions. The country complains of a broken system, that nothing works. That it is a rigged economy. We're being asked to fix it. Where this thing has reached, it needs an overhaul.""
He also urged leaders to uphold integrity and serve the people diligently by practising empathy.
""I didn't grow up as a child of privilege. I'm 38 years and came to Parliament aged 29. The first 29 years I spent in Eastlands. I have sold sim sim like kids you see on the streets. When I see them I reflect and know what it feels. Why is it when we're granted an opportunity to serve, we don't make it better?"" he posed.
Cheruiyot forwarded the motion for the National Assembly to fast-track recommendations by the president to delete all 69 clauses within the Finance Bill and to ensure all arms of the government practise austerity measures to curb exorbitant spending.
In August 2023, SRC published a list of salary increments for all state officers except the president and his deputy as part of its third review cycle. The proposals took effect from July 1, 2024.
Prime Cabinet Secretary, Cabinet Secretaries and Attorney General will now earn Ksh.990,000 from the previous Ksh.957,000. Also, Principal Secretaries, Inspector General of Police Japhet Koome and National Intelligence Service (NIS) Director General Noordin Haji will earn Ksh.819,844 from the previous Ksh.792,519.
In parliament, both Speakers of the House would receive an increment from Ksh.1,185,327 to Ksh.1,208,362. Their deputies will also earn Ksh.966,690 from Ksh.948,261.
MPs and Senators would also earn Ksh.739,600 from the past Ksh.725,502.

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/kenyan-footballs-financial-woes-a-call-for-leadership-and-strategic-investment-n344721,"Kenyan football's financial woes: A call for leadership and strategic investment
The local football season is coming to a close, with the Kenyan Premier League wrapping up this weekend, the Women's Super League ending in two weeks, and most other leagues concluding around this period.
Unfortunately, the harsh reality is that most teams, even those in the Premier League, will finish the season at a significant financial loss. Clubs in other leagues are likely to fare even worse.
This financial struggle is not their fault. Sponsors have abandoned our football due to corruption, arrogance, and a lack of decorum, particularly in handling sponsors and their resources. When football administrators grow wealthier while clubs suffer, the sport slowly dies.
Achieving this requires strategic thinking, improving infrastructure to attract and retain fans, and implementing systemic changes to demonstrate to sponsors that the game is worth their investment.
Some argue that infrastructure is the government's responsibility and thus wash their hands of the matter, but that mindset is unproductive. This is our game. It is a game of partnership, teamwork, and leadership.
The end of the season highlights the urgent need for more leadership in the industry. This is the only way clubs and players can prosper and elevate our game. There are no shortcuts.

Published on: June 25, 2024 09:25 (EAT)

A lacklustre Brazil launched their Copa America campaign with a dour 0-0 draw against Costa Rica on Monday as James Rodriguez inspired Colombia to a 2-1 win over Paraguay.
Brazil, chasing a 10th Copa America crown, dominated possession and territory in the Group D game at the SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles but struggled to break down a resolute Costa Rica.
The Brazilians thought they had taken the lead in the 30th minute after Marquinhos tapped in at the back post after a flick on by Rodrygo following a free-kick by Raphinha.
But after an agonising VAR delay, the goal was chalked off for a fractional offside decision as Costa Rica escaped.
That was as good as it got for Brazil, who laboured to break down Costa Rica's defence for the remainder of the game, registering just three shots on target despite enjoying 73.5 percent possession.
Costa Rica were content to sit back, defending in numbers and rarely venturing forward with any purpose.
The Costa Ricans failed to have a single shot on goal for the entire game.
Brazil coach Dorival Junior paid tribute to Costa Rica's defensive organisation.
""They were very well organised from start to finish,"" he said. ""They were dedicated in everything they did.""
Colombia finished the day top of Group D after collecting all three points in their deserved win over Paraguay at Houston's NRG Stadium.
Rodriguez, whose club career has languished in the decade since he rose to prominence with a dazzling performance at the 2014 World Cup, created both of Colombia's goals.
The 32-year-old midfielder, who has played just a handful of minutes for Brazilian club Sao Paulo in the two months leading into the Copa America, set up the opening goal for Colombia in the 32nd minute.
After finding space on the left, Rodriguez flighted a pinpoint cross to the far post to pick out Daniel Munoz, who beat Paraguay goalkeeper Rodrigo Morinigo with a firm downward header to make it 1-0.
Ten minutes later Colombia doubled their lead and again it was a goal engineered by the trusty left boot of Rodriguez.
This time the goal arrived from the opposite flank, with Rodriguez swinging in a wicked free-kick that was glanced in by Crystal Palace midfielder Jefferson Lerma.
That made it 2-0 at half time to leave Colombia firmly on course to extend their unbeaten streak to 24 games.
Colombia continued to carve out the better chances in the second half, but Paraguay set up a nervy finish after Brighton's Julio Enciso pulled one back in the 69th minute.
Ramon Sosa crossed from the left and Enciso punished slack marking in the Colombia area to hook an angled first-time volley into the bottom corner past Camilo Vargas.
Colombia however controlled play after the Paraguay goal and looked the more threatening team.
The Colombians thought they had earned a penalty in the 84th minute when another teasing Rodriguez cross into the box ended with defender Yerry Mina appearing to be hauled down by Gustavo Velazquez.
Argentinian referee Dario Herrera pointed to the spot but subsequently overturned the decision after a VAR review.
Colombia play Costa Rica in their second group game on Friday, before wrapping up their first-round campaign against Brazil on July 2.

Serbia's Novak Djokovic celebrates after winning against Argentina's Francisco Cerundolo at the end of their men's singles round of sixteen match on Court Philippe-Chatrier on day nine of the French Open tennis tournament at the Roland Garros Complex in Paris on June 3, 2024. (Photo by Emmanuel Dunand / AFP)
Novak Djokovic progressed to a record-equalling 13th Wimbledon semi-final without hitting a ball on Wednesday after Alex de Minaur pulled out injured as former champion Elena Rybakina eased through.
Australian ninth seed De Minaur, 25, announced shortly after midday at the All England Club that he was ""devastated to pull out due to a hip injury"".
It means Djokovic has now equalled Roger Federer's men's record of 13 semi-final appearances at Wimbledon as he closes on the Swiss great's mark of eight singles titles.
The 37-year-old Serbian is also through to a record-extending 49th men's Grand Slam semi-final where he will face Italy's Lorenzo Musetti.
De Minaur, who beat Djokovic at the United Cup in January, said: ""It's no secret that this would have been the biggest match of my career but it's a unique injury.
""I woke up this morning wanting to feel some sort of miracle, but there was a high risk of making the injury worse if I stepped on court.
""One stretch, one slide could take this from a three to six weeks' injury to four months out.""
Djokovic will play 25th seed Musetti for a place in Sunday's showpiece match after the Italian beat US 13th seed Taylor Fritz 3-6, 7-6 (7/5), 6-2, 3-6, 6-1.
The world number two - who had knee surgery last month - does not have a title to his name this year and is still seeking a first victory against a fellow top-10 player.
But a historic 25th Grand Slam triumph is coming into sharp focus for Djokovic, who demolished Holger Rune in straight sets in the fourth round.
The Serb has a 5-1 winning record over 22-year-old Musetti, including a come-from-behind five-set victory at the French Open last month.
""Djokovic knows the stadiums here better than me,"" admitted the Italian.
""He's a legend everywhere and has done unthinkable things. We've played lots of times and I expect a huge fight.
""It's the toughest challenge in tennis but I am an ambitious guy and I like to be challenged. I will give 100 percent.""
In early action on Wednesday, 2022 champion Rybakina barely broke sweat in swatting aside last year's semi-finalist Elina Svitolina 6-3, 6-2 in 61 minutes.
She will face Barbora Krejcikova for a place in Saturday's final after the Czech 31st seed came out on top against Jelena Ostapenko in a battle of former French Open champions.
Russian-born Rybakina, now 19-2 in main-draw matches at Wimbledon, broke the Ukrainian 21st seed four times in the match on Centre Court.
The fourth seed was broken in the first game in front of the watching Queen Camilla but hit back straight away and barely put a foot wrong after that.
The 25-year-old, who crunched 28 winners to Svitolina's eight, said she had ""amazing memories"" from 2022 but does not like the favourite tag.
""I have an aggressive style of game, I have a huge serve so it's a big advantage,"" she said.
Krejcikova took the first set against Latvian 13th seed Ostapenko with a single break on Court No. 1.
Ostapenko, the 2018 Wimbledon semi-finalist, finally broke through in the fourth game of the second set for a 3-1 lead and backed it up with a hold.
But she went dramatically off the boil as Krejcikova reeled off the next four games for a 5-4 lead.
Ostapenko clung on to break the Czech in the 10th game but 2021 French Open champion Krejcikova played the more composed tie-break to seal the victory.
""I told myself that I'm going to leave here everything I have and I'm really happy that I did and it's a great moment for me,"" said Krejcikova.
Victory for the 28-year-old comes after a miserable run in 2024, with her season marred by injury and illness.
Her run to the Birmingham quarter-final last month allowed her to celebrate match wins for the first time since Abu Dhabi in February.
""It was a very, very difficult period. It was actually super difficult even before this tournament,"" she said.

Homa
Bay County Governor Gladys Wanga has voiced strong concerns over police
brutality witnessed in Homa Bay town during recent anti-finance bill protests.
During
her visit to Homa Bay County Teaching and Referral Hospital, Governor Wanga
checked on the victims of the protests and expressed her displeasure with law enforcement's handling of the demonstrations.
“We
are shocked by the actions of the police here because now we have eight young
people admitted here with bullet wounds, three in theatre, and others waiting
to be taken to theatre,"" said Governor Wanga.
The
first-term governor criticized the police officers for their reckless approach,
which resulted in injuries to eight protesters.
She
emphasized that the police involvement was excessive and unnecessary, stressing
that the right to demonstrate unarmed is a constitutional right.
Governor
Wanga urged the government to ensure that police officers protect citizens
rather than harm them during protests.
She
also recalled previous instances where police disrupted peaceful protests, such
as the post-election demonstrations and the Azimio la Umoja Coalition's
petitions against the Kenya Kwanza government.
""We
left our young children to be on the streets, but now the way it is going, we
are going to put on our shoes and boots and join them,"" declared Governor
Wanga.
Despite
the chaos, Governor Wanga confirmed that no property was destroyed in Homa Bay,
highlighting that the excessive force used by the police was unjustified.
She called on Homa Bay-based police to exercise restraint when dealing with civilians, particularly the young people advocating for a just cause.

Pope Francis decried the state of democracy and warned against ""populists"" during a short visit to Trieste in Italy's northeast on Sunday ahead of a 12-day trip to Asia -- the longest of his papacy.
""Democracy is not in good health in the world today,"" Francis said during a speech at the city's convention centre to close a national Catholic event.
Without naming any countries, the pope warned against ""ideological temptations and populists"" on the day that France holds the second round of a snap parliamentary vote that looks set to see the far-right National Rally (RN) party take the largest share of the vote.
""Ideologies are seductive. Some people compare them to the Pied Piper of Hamelin: they seduce but lead you to deny yourself,"" he said in reference to the German fairytale.
""The culture of rejection creates a city where there is no place for the poor, the unborn, the fragile, the sick, children, women, the young,"" he regretted, urging facilitation of social participation from childhood.
Ahead of last month's European parliament elections, bishops in several countries also warned about the rise of populism and nationalism, with far-right parties already holding the reins to power in Italy, Hungary and the Netherlands.
Francis also urged people to ""move away from polarisations that impoverish"" and hit out at ""self-referential power"".
After Venice in April and Verona in May, the half-day trip to Trieste, a city of 200,000 inhabitants on the Adriatic Sea that borders Slovenia, marked the third one within Italy this year for the 87-year-old pontiff, who has suffered increasing health problems in recent years.
Since travelling to the French city of Marseille in September 2023, the Argentine Jesuit has limited himself to domestic travel.
But he plans to spend nearly two weeks in Asia in September visiting Indonesia, Singapore and the islands of Papua New Guinea and East Timor.
He arrived in Trieste shortly before 9:00 am (0600 GMT) and embarked on meetings with various groups from the religious and academic spheres, along with migrants and the disabled.
Pope Francis concluded his visit with a mass in front of some 8,500 worshippers in the city's main public square before heading back to the Vatican in the early afternoon.

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/paarwater-names-simbas-squad-for-rac-assignment-n345665,"Paarwater names Simbas squad for RAC assignment
Kenya rugby 15s programme head coach Jerome Paarwater on Wednesday named
his travelling squad for the Rugby Africa Cup assignment in Uganda with Kabras
Sugar’s George Nyambua captaining the side.
Paarwater says the team will be hoping to kick start their campaign in
high spirits as they go head-to-head with Senegal on July 20 at 12:00pm EAT.
Senegal beat Kenya the last time the two teams clashed here in Nairobi
slightly over two years ago.
“Despite limited preparation time, the players are motivated and ready
to face the challenge. We aim to give our best as the last time the Simbas won
the Africa Cup was in 2013,” said Coach Jerome.
The South African tactician emphasised the importance of the upcoming
match and the need for the team to perform at their highest level.
The squad boasts a mix of seasoned players and new talents, all eager to make their mark in the tournament.
Thomas Okeyo makes a return to their
national set up after a year in the cold, having featured for the Simbas in
2023 during the Currie Cup tournament.
“We had two alignment games, and fortunately, the players have been
active in the Kenya Cup and Rugby Super Series. I have confidence in the boys
ahead of the tournament,” expressed Coach Jerome.
The tournament will be held at Mandela National Stadium from July 18-
29, 2024.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/ksh900k-watch-ksh80k-shoe-and-ksh50k-belt-murkomen-lists-his-most-expensive-items-n345486,"Ksh.900K watch, Ksh.80K shoe and Ksh.50K belt; Murkomen lists his most expensive items
During an interview on the Obinna TV show, Murkomen revealed that he owns a Ksh.900,000 watch while the most expensive shoe is Ksh.80,000. Further, he also owns a Ksh.50,000 belt and a Ksh.20,000 tie. In total, his attire amounted to an average of Ksh.1.1 million.
The CS confirmed his weakness in purchasing expensive items but pointed out that he would correct his mistakes by diverting his cash into profitable investments.
""In this life we're living, there are things that are vanity that you end up buying. I appreciate comments that have come from Kenyans. Had I taken this money to invest in money market, it would have earned it me interest. That is my weakness but I'm willing to correct myself,"" he said.
With his obsession for watches dating back to 1991, Murkomen said that it originated from his father who bought him his first watch upon improving his performance in primary school.
""My first watch I wore in 1991 in class 6. My father realised I had obsession with watches. He said if I become number 1 in class(I was normally number three or four), he would buy me a watch. My friend, I read and revised and ultimately became number 2. This is because the teachers did not allow me to become number one. They were wondering how in one term I moved from third place to first. In Home Science, I had 88 and the other guy 87. For some reason, I ended up having 85 and he beat me with one mark,"" he remarked.
""I went home and cried. I told my dad I didn't manage despite me working hard. There was a time I read until my father told me to sleep and it was at 3:00 am. He felt pity on me and told me I had earned it. He bought me a Casio. So, the other day I was on official trip and I found Casio on one of the airports and I bought it to remind myself of the first watch I wore. Even though the amount was Ksh.9,000 value wise it's more.""
He cleared the air on the expensive watches that people expose online, saying that the amounts are not the true reflection of the actual cost.
""There are two watches that keep circulating, the first one wasn't that expensive. The second one I bought it from a friend who sells watches. He sold me a Rolex at thirty per cent of the price and even gave me time to pay it slowly. I informed him that he had landed me in trouble. He told me that he wanted me to feel that I have spent something to hold it valuable but confirmed that it was the price that was circulating online,"" he pointed out.
CS Murkomen has earned the reputation of being one of the most expensively dressed CSs as his attires have elicited debate from Kenyans who are grappling with the tough economic conditions.
From imported designer suits, Gucci shoes to Hublot Classic Fusion Ceramic King Gold watch, Kenyans have called him out for his lavish lifestyle.
This comes amid calls by Kenyans for the government to account for the revenue spent and seal corruption loopholes.
Further, the public has called for a lifestyle audit on government officials to determine their source of wealth.
During an X Space conversation on Friday, President William Ruto confirmed that he has had to call some of his officials out for what he termed as ""obnoxious opulence.""
"" I agree some of our officials are arrogant and some display obnoxious opulence, if I may say that which doesn't just anger the public. Sometimes I call them and give them a peace of my mind... When you are in my position, you are a father figure and some of these young people get excited about many things and sometimes do the wrong thing,"" Ruto stated.
""I have said that I know what's going on and have promised I will be making changes.""

https://www.citizen.digital/news/bolivia-coup-attempt-fails-after-military-assault-on-presidential-palace-n344759,"Bolivia coup attempt fails after military assault on presidential palace
Earlier in the day, military units led by General Juan Jose Zuniga, recently stripped of his military command, had gathered in the central Plaza Murillo square, home to the presidential palace and Congress. A Reuters witness saw an armored vehicle ram a door of the presidential palace and soldiers rush in.
""Today the country is facing an attempted coup d'état. Today the country faces once again interests so that democracy in Bolivia is cut short,"" Arce said in comments from the presidential palace, with armed soldiers outside.
""The Bolivian people are summoned today. We need the Bolivian people to organize and mobilize against the coup d'état in favor of democracy.""
A few hours later, a Reuters witness saw soldiers withdraw from the square and police take control of the plaza. Bolivian authorities arrested Zuniga and took him away, though their destination was unclear.
Inside the presidential palace, Arce swore in José Wilson Sanchez as the military commander, Zuniga's former role. He called for calm and order to be restored.
""I order that all personnel mobilized on the streets return to their units,"" Sanchez said. ""We entreat that the blood of our soldiers not be spilled.""
The United States said it was closely monitoring the situation and urged calm and restraint.
Tensions have been building in Bolivia ahead of general elections in 2025, with leftist ex-President Evo Morales planning to run against former ally Arce, creating a major rift in the ruling socialist party and wider political uncertainty.
Many do not want a return of Morales, who governed from 2006-2019 when he was ousted amid widespread protests and replaced by an interim conservative government. Arce then won election in 2020.
Zuniga said recently that Morales should not be able to return as president and threatened to block him if he attempted to, which led Arce to remove Zuniga from his post.
Ahead of the attack on the presidential palace, Zuniga had addressed reporters in the square and cited growing anger in the landlocked country, which has been battling an economic slump with depleted central bank reserves and pressure on the boliviano currency as gas exports have dried up.
""The three chiefs of the armed forces have come to express our dismay,"" Zuniga told a local TV station, calling for a new cabinet of ministers.
""Stop destroying, stop impoverishing our country, stop humiliating our army,"" he said in full uniform, flanked by soldiers, insisting the action being taken was supported by the public.
Zuniga told reporters later on Wednesday that Arce had on Sunday asked him to ""raise something up"" to boost his popularity, without offering evidence.
Interior Minister Eduardo del Castillo later said Zuniga was seeking to court popular support and that the nine people injured in the attempt proved ""this was not a drill.""
'STRONGEST CONDEMNATION'
Morales, head of the ruling MAS socialist party, said that his supporters would mobilize in support of democracy.
""We will not allow the armed forces to violate democracy and intimidate people,"" Morales said.
Bolivia's public prosecutor's office said it would launch a criminal investigation against Zuniga and others involved in the attempted coup.
Public support for Arce and Bolivia's democracy has poured in from regional leaders and beyond.
""We express the strongest condemnation of the attempted coup d'état in Bolivia. Our total support and support for President Luis Alberto Arce Catacora,"" Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on X.
Even conservative political opponents of the government in Bolivia condemned the military action, including ex-President Jeanine Anez, who was imprisoned in 2022 amid political turmoil.
""I fully reject of the mobilization of the military in the Plaza Murillo attempting to destroy constitutional order,"" she wrote on X. ""The MAS with Arce and Evo must be got out through the vote in 2025. We Bolivians will defend democracy.""

Rising on the House floor, Asige stated that the World Bank intends to advance billions of dollars to Kenya on the condition that President William Ruto's administration resettle at least 400,000 refugees in Kenya.
""I have asked the Senate to investigate why Government is allegedly being given Ksh.156 billion from the World Bank with the condition of integrating 400,000 refugees into Kenya. We want to know the reasons, the details of this agreement and why now,"" Asige said.
""The Standing Committee on Finance should confirm whether the KSh.156 billion is a loan or a grant, and explain why the condition to integrate refugees should be attached to approval of the funding,"" she added.
Asige further demanded that the committee explain the origin of the 400,000 refugees and why there is a link to the World Bank's Ksh.156 billion funding.
""Explain why they are in Kenya now and the criteria and parameters to which they are in Kenya,"" she demanded.
The claims come at a time President William Ruto's administration is facing internal strive from Gen Z youths who are demanding for better governance.
The youths organised and executed deadly protests when Ruto's administration tried to pass an unpopular Finance Bill 2024, and they have since demanded accountability from the government and the leaders.
Ruto conceded, dropped the bill, and promised austerity measures to reduce government spending.
The president has also appointed a committee to audit the country's debts, with the aim of finding lasting solutions on how to repay them.

Published on: July 07, 2024 10:46 (EAT)
Netherlands players celebrate after the UEFA Euro 2024 quarter-final football match between the Netherlands and Turkey at the Olympiastadion in Berlin on July 6, 2024. (Photo by JOHN MACDOUGALL / AFP)
The Netherlands struck two second-half goals in seven minutes to come from behind to beat Turkey 2-1 on Saturday and set up a Euro 2024 semi-final clash with England.
Samet Akaydin sent Turkey ahead in the first half but Stefan de Vrij headed the Netherlands level and Murt Muldur turned into his own net under pressure from Cody Gakpo after 76 minutes to hand the Dutch victory.
The build-up to the quarter-final clash in Berlin was overshadowed by a diplomatic row between Turkey and Germany after their last-16 hero Merih Demiral was banned for two matches for making a controversial salute.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan attended the match at the Olympiastadion as a result, along with tens of thousands of fans who greeted every sustained Dutch period of possession with a barrage of whistles.
Netherlands overcame the pressure from the stands and Turkey's energetic style, as well as a flurry of late chances, to reach the Euros semi-finals for the first time since 2004.
""Tonight we had to dig very deep and I am proud of these guys,"" Netherlands captain Virgil van Dijk told NOS.
""We made a very good start in my eyes (but) we got sloppy and lost balls at dangerous moments... then we had to try and stay calm and take advantage of the chances that were going to come...
""We want to fulfil our dream and we are one step closer.""
Turkey coach Vincenzo Montella deployed five at the back, hoping his young side could catch Netherlands on the counter-attack.
It was the 1988 Euros champions who carved out the first chance, with Gakpo and Memphis Depay linking up well before the latter blazed over.
Koeman captained the Netherlands to glory 36 years ago but until their convincing 3-0 win over Romania in the last 16, the Dutch looked incapable of challenging for the trophy, sneaking through their group in third place.
They reverted to that weaker self in the first half after their early incursions, allowing Turkey to firmly establish themselves in the game.
Montella's side began to pin the Netherlands back with a string of set pieces, eventually capitalising after 35 minutes when Arda Guler recycled a corner which was only half-cleared.
The 19-year-old Real Madrid playmaker swirled in a cross dripping with temptation with his weaker right foot, and Akaydin, who returned from suspension to replace the banned Demiral, powered home a far post header.
Turkish fans, unsurprisingly filling three-quarters of the stadium given their large diaspora in Germany, roared and ignited flares in celebration.
- Weghorst the game-changer -
Koeman had to shake things up at the interval and brought on Wout Weghorst, the team's saviour against Poland in their opening fixture, for Steven Bergwijn.
The burly Burnley striker made a rapid impact, giving the Netherlands a target to hit up front, which they looked for with regularity.
Guler continued to probe at the other end and was scythed down by Nathan Ake, crashing the resulting free-kick against Bart Verbruggen's post.
Turkey, in their first quarter-final at a major tournament since 2008, almost grabbed a second but Verbruggen saved well from Kenan Yildiz.
At the other end Weghorst forced a smart stop from Mert Gunok, but the Turkish goalkeeper was soon beaten by De Vrij.
Memphis Depay swung in a cross after a short corner and Inter Milan defender De Vrij met it with a towering header to level in the 70th minute.
Just six minutes later, Denzel Dumfries swept in a dangerous low ball which Muldur bundled into his own net as Euros joint-top scorer Gakpo tried to reach it. It was the 10th own goal of the tournament.
Although Weghorst was not directly involved in either goal, his presence in the box completely unsettled Turkey's previously sturdy defence.
Montella's side should have levelled but Zeki Celik and Kerem Akturkoglu had efforts blocked in a frantic finale and the Netherlands lived to fight another day -- against England on Wednesday in Dortmund.
Turkey substitute Bertug Yildirim was sent off for dissent from the bench in the final stages, ensuring his country matched the worst ever discipline tally in Euros history -- 19 yellow cards and one red, set by the Czech Republic in 1996.

Deputy County Commissioner for Rongo sub county, George Otenga said two miners died while they were receiving treatment while three died inside the collapsed mine bringing.
Otenga said there were 18 miners inside the collapsed mine when the incident occurred and they are now in the process of accounting for all affected persons.
The Deputy County Commissioner said they were informed that some of the miners who were inside the collapsed mine managed to escape through other routes and they are in the process of counting them physically to establish if the 13 others survived.
Otenga said they have sent out officers to locate all the survivors of the collapsed mine.
He lauded all the stakeholders who took part in the rescue exercise that ended late in the night. Otenga said the concerted effort among all stakeholders helped them locate the miners inside the 750 feet deep mining shaft.
Meanwhile the commissioner has appealed to the miners to take necessary precautions when prospecting gold to mitigate deaths and injuries in the mines.
A spot check done by Citizen Digital established that safety measures are still an issue in the gold mining sector in Migori County. A sizable number of miners access the mines without protective gear.

Here is a list of lawmakers who have publicly called for Biden to not run again.
REPRESENTATIVE LLOYD DOGGETT
Doggett, a U.S. House of Representatives member from a safe Democratic district in Texas, was the first congressional Democrat to call for Biden to step down.
""President Biden has continued to run substantially behind Democratic senators in key states and in most polls has trailed Donald Trump,"" Doggett said in a statement. ""I had hoped that the debate would provide some momentum to change that. It did not.""
REPRESENTATIVE RAUL GRIJALVA
Grijalva, a liberal who represents a district in southern Arizona along the border with Mexico, told the New York Times it was time for Biden to end his campaign, saying, ""If he's the candidate, I'm going to support him, but I think that this is an opportunity to look elsewhere."" Grijalva representatives did not respond to requests for comment.
REPRESENTATIVE SETH MOULTON
Moulton praised Biden's service to the country but called on him to follow in ""George Washington's footsteps and step aside to let new leaders rise up and run against Donald Trump,"" the Democrat representing a Massachusetts district told a local radio show.
REPRESENTATIVE MIKE QUIGLEY
A moderate from Illinois, Quigley told MSNBC that Biden must step aside and ""let someone else do this"" or risk ""utter catastrophe.""
REPRESENTATIVE ANGIE CRAIG
Craig, whose district is considered a top priority for Republicans to win back in November, was the first incumbent from a highly competitive district to call for Biden to step down.
""Given what I saw and heard from the president during last week's debate in Atlanta, coupled with the lack of a forceful response from the president himself following that debate, I do not believe that the president can effectively campaign and win against Donald Trump,"" Craig said.

Published on: June 26, 2024 10:10 (EAT)
Canadian police blamed on Wednesday the driver of a small bus for a crash that killed 17 elderly people last year, saying he had pulled out in front of a speeding truck when it was not safe to do so.
Authorities said they would not charge the driver, since he had suffered a traumatic brain injury.
The crash, one of the worst in Canadian history, occurred in June 2023 about 170 kms west of Winnipeg in the central province of Manitoba.
The driver of the bus, carrying senior citizens to a casino, entered a highway intersection ""when it was unsafe to do so"" and the truck then smashed into the vehicle, police superintendent Rob Lasson told a press conference.
""It happened because of a choice made by the bus driver. However, we cannot prove that choice that day was the result of anything criminal,"" he said.
Chris Vanderhooft, a prosecutor working for the Manitoba government, said blind spots inside the bus had prevented the driver from seeing the truck.
The crash was the worst in Canada since 16 people died in 2018 when a truck hit a bus transporting a junior hockey team in neighboring Saskatchewan. The truck driver was sentenced to eight years in prison.

Romania and Slovakia both qualified for the last 16
at Euro 2024 after a tense 1-1 draw in their last Group E game on Wednesday.
Ondrej Duda put Slovakia ahead in the first half but
Romania's Razvan Marin equalised with a penalty before the interval.
With all four teams in the group earning four points
from their three games, Romania finished top having scored more goals than
second-placed Belgium.
Slovakia went through in third place thanks to a
superior goal difference to fourth-placed Ukraine.
It was a memorable moment for Romania, who are into
the knockout stages of the Euros for the first time in 24 years.
Romania had only qualified once for the last 16 in
their five Euro appearances, but Edward Iordanescu's tenacious side have ended
that long drought
They responded to Iordanescu's pre-match challenge
to make ""history"" with a combative display fuelled by their army of
vociferous fans, who turned the stadium into a sea of yellow.
Slovakia are into the knockout stages of a major
tournament for the third time.
They reached the last 16 in the 2010 World Cup and
made it to the same stage at Euro 2016.
Knowing a draw would send both teams through, cynics
had suggested they would play out a mutually beneficial stalemate.
But there was no sign of Romania settling for a
point as they made a fast start.
They threatened an early goal when Andrei Ratiu's
stinging strike was pushed away by Martin Dubravka, with the rebound lashed
wildly over by Ianis Hagi.
Marin smashed a free-kick narrowly wide from long
range moments late as Romania looked to capitalise on their early dominance.
Slovakia were inches away from snatching the lead as
Lukas Haraslin's free-kick went through a crowd of players and almost crept in
at the far post.
It was a warning Romania failed to heed and Slovakia
went in front in the 24th minute.
Juraj Kucka whipped in a deep cross that caught the
Romania defence standing statuesque, leaving the unmarked Duda free to power
his header past Florin Nita from eight yards.
Romania's response was emphatic as they drew level
in the 37th minute thanks to an incisive raid from the son of former Barcelona
and Real Madrid star Gheorghe Hagi.
David Hancko's foul on Hagi was adjudged a penalty
by VAR after referee Daniel Siebert initially ruled the offence had taken place
just outside the area.
Marin stepped up to drill the spot-kick high into
the roof of the net to the deafening delight of the hordes of Romania fans who
turned the arena into a frenzied mosh-pit.
The searing Frankfurt heat gave way to a heavy storm
in the second half as thunder, lightning and rain swirled around the stadium.
It was a suitably dramatic backdrop to a tense clash
that was close to swinging Romania's way when Marin forced a good save from
Dubravka before Denis Dragus skimmed the roof of the net.
Haraslin's curler flashed past the far post as the
storm abated, but, while there was no winner, both sides ended up celebrating
their progress to the knockout stage.

Education Cabinet Secretary Ezekiel Machogu, who on Saturday toured schools and IDP camps in Tana Delta Sub County in the company of the Principal Secretary for Arid and Semi Arid Lands (ASAL) Kelo Arsama and Garsen MP Ali Wario said that the ministry had already set aside funds for renovations of schools and relocation of others to enable smooth learning activities in the area.
“We have set aside funds that will be toppled up with the NGCDF for construction of classrooms and improving infrastructure in schools,” he said.
At least 22 schools in Tana Delta Sub County were submerged by flood waters in March 2024 and others are still water logged hence affecting education of thousands of learners.
On the teacher shortage in the area, Machogu said that more teachers will be posted in schools as he encouraged parents to take their children to Teachers Training colleges as a way of addressing mass exodus of teachers from outside Tana River.
“I have seen you have a shortage of 297 teachers and as a ministry we are going to send more teachers this year so that we can bridge that gap. Education is the only equalizer and we have vacancies in the teaching profession but in Tana River very few have the qualifications and I want to challenge parents to take their children for teaching courses so that they can be employed here instead of you depending on teachers from other regions,” he said.
On his part, PS Arsama said that his department was already distributing iron sheets and other building materials and food items to residents that were displaced by the floods so that they can restart their lives.
“The President has directed me to ensure that all the victims of floods are resettled and that is why we are distributing building materials and food items to enable them restart their lives,” he said.
MP Wario on the other hand thanked the national government for assuring to resettle IDPs on higher grounds to curb future flood destructions.
“Many schools were affected by floods and many are in camps but we want a teacher training college in Garsen so that we can have local teachers,” he said.

Ulinzi Starlets have made history by beating Kibera Soccer Ladies 2-1 to successfully defend their Football Kenya Federation (FKF) Women’s Cup title and become the unprecedented three-time winners in a match played at Police Sacco Stadium, Nairobi.
Ulinzi Starlets showed intent early on in the match, after Captain Sheryl Andiba scored their first goal in the fifth minute.
The soldiers continued to dominate the match and nearly doubled their lead a minute later, but Lucy Nato’s shot was well cleared by Kibera Soccer Ladies’ custodian Vivian Shiyonzo.
Ulinzi created another chance in the 8th minute through long-serving forward Neddy Atieno, but her shot went wide.
In the 20th minute, Ulinzi fans were on their feet eager to celebrate the second goal, but Fasila Adhiambo’s shot went wide.
The soldiers were however gifted with their second goal in the 40th minute through Lynda Kihara, sending Ulinzi to the break with a comfortable lead.
Kibera returned from the break rejuvenated and were rewarded with a consolation goal in the 75th minute through substitute Maximillah Robi, who came in for Lucy Njeri in the second half.
Ulinzi nearly made it 3-0 when substitute Joy Oriyo, who also turns up for Rising Starlets, got a golden chance but was ruled offside by the referee.
Ulinzi coach Joseph Wambua Mwanza lauded his charges for holding on to the lead despite a second half scare from the opponents.
“We managed to score two goals, but in the second half the opponents changed their tactics which gave us a scare, but we managed to maintain our lead and win the match. They were behind by two goals, so it’s normal they had to work harder and score, but we did manage our game well and emerge victorious,” said Wambua.
On his part, Kibera Soccer Ladies coach David Vijago attributed the loss to the new team which was yet to fully jell.
“Football is a game of chances, it went the way it did and we lost the match. We can’t pretend but they had a good side and they prepared well from when the premier league started. My team is new and was assembled when we joined the premier league, but I congratulate them for playing well,” noted coach Vijago.
The culmination for the FKF Women’s Cup means
the 2023/2024 season is over and now the teams will head for pre-season to
prepare for next season scheduled to start in August.

The richly decorated guns inlaid with gold and silver feature the engraved image of Napoleon in full imperial pomp.
They are said to have almost been used to end the French ruler's life in 1814 when he was forced to give up power after foreign forces defeated his army and occupied Paris.
""After the defeat of the French campaign, he was totally depressed and wanted to commit suicide with these weapons but his grand squire removed the powder,"" auctioneer Jean-Pierre Osenat told AFP.
Napoleon instead took poison but vomited and survived, and later gave the pistols to his squire to thank him for his loyalty, Osenat added.
They are expected to fetch 1.2-1.5 million euros ($1.3-1.6 million) at Sunday's auction in Fontainebleau, south of Paris.
Memorabilia of the emperor is extremely sought-after among collectors.
His famous black cocked hat with its blue, white and red trimmings sold for 1.9 million euros in November.
Upon his abdication, Napoleon went into exile on the island of Elba off the coast of Italy.
He would soon grow bored and make a dramatic return to France, only to have his career definitively ended when he was defeated by the British at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, dying in exile on the island of St Helena six years later.

Published on: July 06, 2024 12:55 (EAT)
This combination of pictures created on July 3, 2024 shows (L) Switzerland's head coach Murat Yakin attending a training session at the Stadion auf der Waldau in Stuttgart on July 3, 2024, during the UEFA Euro 2024 football championship; and England's head coach Gareth Southgate during the UEFA Euro 2024 round of 16 football match between England and Slovakia at the Arena AufSchalke in Gelsenkirchen on June 30, 2024.

Spain will face France in the semi-finals of Euro 2024 after knocking out hosts Germany as Turkey reacted with dismay to defender Merih Demiral's two-match ban for making an alleged ultra-nationalist salute.
Luis de la Fuente's Spain triumphed 2-1 in an engrossing match between the two best-performing teams at the tournament, thanks to Mikel Merino heading home Dani Olmo's cross just as the match looked destined for a penalty shoot-out.
""This is a winning horse... I'm proud to coach players like this, players that are insatiable,"" said De la Fuente.
It was a tough end to the tournament for Germany, who pushed Spain all the way and took the match to extra time with Florian Wirtz's 89th-minute strike which levelled Olmo's opener for La Roja.
""We played a good tournament but when you're so close, to be eliminated like that, it's bitter,"" said Toni Kroos after his final Germany match.
Spain now will be favourites to claim a record-breaking fourth European crown after their seventh straight win inspired by Olmo, who replaced injured Pedri after just eight minutes following a clash between the Barcelona midfielder and Kroos.
They came through a huge test against the Germans in Stuttgart and will pose a completely different kind of problem to France, who beat Portugal 5-3 on penalties after a drab match finished goalless after extra time.
Theo Hernandez coolly struck home the winning spot-kick as France went through to the last four despite their only goals from open play in the tournament being scored by opposition players.
Joao Felix was the only player to miss in the shoot-out, striking the base of post, meaning that Portugal go home and ageing icon Cristiano Ronaldo failed to score a goal at a major tournament for the first time in his career.
France have reached the semis in four of the last five tournaments and coach Didier Deschamps said: ""We mustn't take that for granted, that's what I always say. It's what all the players in the team deserve.""
Turkey's government blasted as ""unfair and biased"" Demiral's ban, which means he misses Saturday's last-eight clash with the Netherlands and that his Euros campaign is over unless Vincenzo Montella's team reach the final.
Demiral was the unlikely hero with a brace in Turkey's 2-1 win over Austria in the last 16 and during celebrations for his second goal made a gesture associated with Turkish right-wing extremist group Grey Wolves.
UEFA banned Demiral for, among other things, ""violating the basic rules of decent conduct"", a move which Turkey's Sports Minister Osman Askin Bak claimed was politically motivated and Montella said was based on a ""misunderstanding"".
""It wasn't a political gesture as it was interpreted,"" insisted Montella, who added that the wolf gesture is a ""symbol of the Turks"".
Turkey will have a vociferous backing in Berlin for a match which will be attended by the country's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who claimed Demiral was just ""showing his excitement"".
England will have Jude Bellingham available for their quarter-final with Switzerland after he was handed a reprieve by UEFA for his crotch-grabbing celebration after keeping the Three Lions in the competition in the last 16.
Bellingham, who has scored twice in Germany, was filmed mimicking the gesture while apparently looking towards Slovakia's bench following his stunning stoppage-time overhead kick which took that match to extra time.
Coach Gareth Southgate called UEFA's ruling, which allows him to select his star player, a ""common sense"" decision.
""I think there was no intent in the gesture towards anybody other than the communication he has with his family,"" claimed Southgate.
A win over the Swiss, who dumped out Italy in the last 16, would set up a semi-final with Turkey or the Dutch as England look to break a 58-year major tournament duck.

Bayern Munich have signed French forward Michael Olise from
Crystal Palace, the German giants announced on Sunday.
German magazine Kicker reported Bayern paid a release clause
of 70 million euros ($75 million) to the Premier League club to secure Olise's
services on a five-year deal.
Olise, 22, completed a medical in the Bavarian capital on
Sunday.
""It's a great challenge, and that's exactly what I was
looking for,"" Olise said.
""I want to prove myself at this level and play my part
in ensuring that we win as many titles as possible with our team in the coming
years.""

He is Bayern's second major arrival of the summer after Japan
defender Hiroki Ito who arrived from Stuttgart.
Bayern finished third behind champions Bayer Leverkusen and
Stuttgart last season, breaking a streak of 11 straight Bundesliga titles.

32 Bundesliga games, Bayern struggled for goals last season, with only Jamal
Musiala (10 goals) reaching double figures.

-– that's what players like Michael Olise stand for,"" Bayern sporting
director Max Eberl said in a statement.

Speaking at a church service in Bomet on Sunday, Gachagua revealed that he has received tens of messages from dissatisfied Kenyans who want him to stop apologising on behalf of MPs.
“Kenyans don’t want me to apologise on behalf of the MPs. They have warned me that if I continue defending them then I will find myself in trouble. So I have decided not to talk about the MPs and instead focus on President William Ruto and me,” Gachagua said.
He went on to ask the embattled MPs to return to the electorate, face them, and seek forgiveness on their own.
The DP described how on Saturday, while making stops in Kenol, Murang'a county, residents refused to listen to the MPs who had accompanied him.
“When I was in Kenol and the MPs who were with me wanted to speak, the residents said no and insisted that I address them. This shows that Kenyans are angry with their MPs and it’s now time they (MPs) go back to the grassroots and talk to their people,” he added.
Gachagua also cautioned elected and appointed leaders against displaying arrogance and opulence towards Kenyans, reminding them that they are in different capacities to serve the people.
He claimed that leaders' arrogance towards Kenyans is a bad example that continues to erode trust between the people and the leaders.
Kenyans have expressed outrage at MPs who voted YES on the rejected bill, the majority of whom were elected by the ruling Kenya Kwanza coalition.
Some of the MPs have faced rejection and opposition from their constituents, with others having their homes and property raided.
A section of Kenyans have also faulted religious institutions for going to bed with politicians, something that has seen several churches cancel planned harambees to be presided over by politicians.
The punitive Finance Bill 2024 saw Kenyans, majority of them youth, take to streets in protest, which culminated in Tuesday’s invasion of the Kenyan Parliament.
President Ruto was forced to reject the bill in totality after the protests turned violent, leading to the shooting deaths of some of the protesters by the police.

With only 25 days remaining to the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, Kenya's
sprinters have intensified training in a bid to make a significant impact
on the global tracks.
Africa’s
fastest man Ferdinand Omanyala, Zablon Ekwam and Wiseman Were are the three
sprinters that have qualified for the Paris Olympics in 100m, 400m and 400m
hurdles respectively.
Omanyala says
he is aiming for a spot on the podium, as he is confident his new training
techniques being implemented by his coach, Geoffrey Kimani, will bear fruit.
“There is a model that I have been taught, I was a
bit scared but I tried it in the trials and it worked, meaning I'm adopting
that model. So, I'm hoping to see how I'm going to run with that model when we are
under pressure,” noted Omanyala.
Zablon Ekwam,
set to compete in the 400m, emphasized the significance of upcoming races in
Belgium and Italy, which he considers essential for evaluating his progress.
“We are just trying to sharpen the edges to ensure we
get the speed right. I'm having two races in Belgium and Italy. Those races are
going to show me exactly where I am,” explained Ekwam.
Wiseman Were, who won a bronze at the 2022 Commonwealth Games with the
4x400m relay team, remains optimistic about his chances of reaching the finals in the 400m
hurdles.
“This season we have managed to run 48, looking to Paris with good race
plan and the speed we are going to put in together, I'm going to
get a 47. I'm looking forward (to) seeing myself
in finals. I'm set and ready to go,” he said confidently.
The Kenyan team will head
to Miramas, France on
Wednesday next week to continue their intensive training camp.

The Opposition leader wants the National Police Service to take full responsibility for the deaths and injuries registered during the unrest, and at the same time faulting the courts for allowing military deployment within civilian spaces.
Odinga faulted the Judiciary’s interpretation of military’s mandate in the country.
“The military are not supposed to be in the streets. The Army is supposed to protect the civilians against external aggressors,” he noted.
Speaking during the funeral service of the late Luo Council of Elders Secretary, late Mzee Owino Nyadi in Ugunja, Siaya County, the Opposition leader stated that involving the military in community policing means that the civilian authority in the country has failed.
“This means that the civilian authority in this country has failed,” said Odinga.
Raila demanded action be taken against rogue police officers, directly responsible for the massacre of protesters during the demonstrations, adding that such trigger-happy officers are criminals who needs to be dealt with in accordance to the law.
“Which goons are they? Who sent the goons? Police are not supposed to be shooting to kill people, ”Odinga stated.
The Opposition leader, called on the youth to continue engaging in meaningful conversation and debate regarding proper leadership and accountability of public resources.
“We support the young people to keep on with the accountability momentum,” he added.

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/seasoned-journalist-reflects-on-media-anti-doping-efforts-in-kenya-n345328,"Seasoned journalist reflects on media anti-doping efforts in Kenya
With only 20 days left to the Paris Olympic, high-profile
anti-doping messages have added attention to the sports media ecosystem in
Kenya.
In this year's Olympics season, Sports Journalists Association of Kenya (SJAK) has continued the partnership with Anti-Doping Agency of Kenya (ADAK) for the annual “Clean Sport Workshop” - now in its fifth edition in Naivasha.
Former BBC sports presenter Michelle Katami during a session in the workshop on Saturday shared her thoughts about the status of doping coverage then and now, underlining the importance of sports scribes in fighting the doping menace.
A veteran all-round
sports journalist formerly with, SuperSport and Radio Africa Group, Katami has
seen doping dynamics morph through different guises.
“Tackling doping issues back in the day was challenging as one
needed to have 100% facts on the table. During the Isaiah Kiplagat (former Athletics
Kenya president) regime – there was no ADAK, and AK would just release
statements – it was difficult to cover matters doping,” she reflected.
“Another challenge then was to try to talk to various sources,
try to convince people in the athletics ecosystem to talk about doping and what
they know. Following doping leads was a major challenge,” added Katami.
“The one thing I have learnt over time is ‘duty of care’; to
protect athletes whose lives are in danger, try to shape a different narrative;
just like we did when Kenya was on the brink of a possible WADA ban.
“When covering doping, you have to have your media house back you up 100% in terms of resources, you need to develop good working rapport with athletes and coaches, do your own analysis on performances. Initially, we would say progression but athletics is changing,” she observed.
Katami also acknowledged the sensitivity of reporting on doping, saying a slight mistake in presentation of the story can result to a huge mess.
“You have to acknowledge the fact that the number of doping cases has been on the rise, more so in stories featuring Kenyan athletes. In doping, use of the correct terms is of paramount importance, don’t say banned when an athlete is provisionally suspended.""

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/malen-doubles-up-as-dutch-beat-romania-to-reach-euro-2024-quarters-n345087,"Malen doubles up as Dutch beat Romania to reach Euro 2024 quarters
The Netherlands swept into their first European Championship
quarter-final since 2008 as Donyell Malen scored twice in a 3-0 win over
Romania in the last 16 on Tuesday.
Cody Gakpo gave the Dutch an early lead but they were unable to
convert pressure into a crucial second goal until the Liverpool forward set up
Malen with seven minutes remaining in Munich.
Romania were gritty but out-classed, lacking the quality to punish
their opponents' profligacy before Malen added his second on the counter in
stoppage-time.
The victory put the Oranje on course for a quarter-final clash
with Turkey or Austria, who beat the Netherlands in 3-2 in the group stage.
Ronald Koeman's side will need to improve their effectiveness in
front of goal should they wish to emulate their manager, who was a player
for the Dutch when they won the 1988 Euros on German soil.
Prior to the game, Netherlands' captain Virgil van Dijk said his
side lacked energy and the ""will to win"" in the loss to Austria.
But the Dutch were still strangely flat in the early stages
despite Van Dijk's rallying cry.
Group E winners Romania, whose 3-0 victory over Ukraine in their
opening game, was just their second ever win in the Euros, pinned the Dutch
back early.
Romania went close when Dennis Man latched onto a superb diagonal
ball from Nicolae Stanciu, but the Parma winger blasted over.
The Dutch broke Romania's momentum shortly after when Gakpo got on
the end of a sweeping move to open the scoring on 20 minutes.
Jerdy Schouten sliced a perfect, long pass through the midfield to
Xavi Simons, who found Gakpo on the left flank.
Gakpo eluded Andrei Ratiu and seemed to catch goalkeeper Florin
Nita off-guard, blasting in at the near post.
The goal ignited a period of Dutch dominance, Stefan de Vrij
heading inches wide five minutes later.
The Netherlands wasted a perfect chance to double their lead with
half-time approaching when Denzel Dumfries picked Bogdan Racovitan's pocket and
found Simons, who got tangled up and failed to get a decent shot away.
Koeman's team squandered an array of opportunities early in the
second-half.
Memphis Depay and van Dijk went agonisingly close before Gakpo's
second was ruled out by VAR for offside.
With every missed chance, the nerves in the Dutch camp seemed to
grow, but Romania lacked the quality to truly punish them.
Gakpo, the most impressive man in orange, took matters into his
own hands with seven minutes remaining, dribbling through a crowded penalty
area and finding Malen who tapped home.
With
Romania launching a final attack, Malen broke through on the counter and slid
the ball into the goal in the fourth minute of stoppage-time to seal the
victory.

Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris said a hoax bomb threat made to his home on Wednesday night is ""utterly unacceptable"" and that the intimidation of politicians and their families cannot be allowed to continue.
There have been increased instances of people gathering outside the homes of Irish ministers, sometimes wearing masks and erecting anti-migrant banners.
Three men were arrested last week over the alleged harassment of an elected official after they gathered outside Harris' home.
Migration has become a heated debate in Ireland as the government struggles to accommodate record numbers of refugees and occasionally violent protests have been held outside accommodation centres where migrants are living.
""This is an utterly unacceptable situation,"" Harris told reporters at a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels on Thursday.
""Even the word hoax I'm not sure is a fair word with respect because I've no doubt these things are done to intimidate, to upset. I have young children. I have a wife,"" he said.
""I do think all of us in our discourse, including media, need to reflect on how we comment on these matters. If masked men turned up outside your house, it wouldn't be described as protest. It's not protest when it happens outside my house either and this situation can't be allowed to continue.""

The family of Mike Brian Kasaine are struggling to come to
terms with the loss of their son following Wednesday’s explosive encounter
between Narok anti-riot police and the fearless Gen Z youth which allegedly led
to him being shot to death.
According to his family, the fire-blazing youth had
overpowered the men in uniform and had pushed them closer to the Narok police
gate where the late met his fate while in combat with his crew.
Mary Nyanchoka is a mother in pain as she narrated how the
day started well on for fate to strike her son who she had hopes in and worst
the police denied on several occasions having shot or known anything in
connection to the case.
""When darkness fell, at around 7 pm, my son did not come home…We
went to the hospital to look for him but hatukumpata. We went to the police but
officers said nobody had been arrested. Yesterday niliamkia tena 6 am Kwenda hosi

“Now I just want to know who shot and killed my son and what
he did to deserve such.”

KCSE last year in Nyamira’s St Peters Nyakemincha Secondary School and was set
to join Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University but according to him, a dream set to
uplift them has been shattered.
“He completed his KCSE exams last year and was supposed to
join university this year. He left home at around 4 pm…si ati siku yake ilikua
imefika lakini, how come the officers who are supposed to protect us are at the
frontline in killing us? We want justice to be done,” He said.
Joscar Rioki an aunt to the late could hot hold back emotion
as she repeatedly expressed hope for justice.
“I am bitter for my nephew…I want the government to look at
us..May God protect us cause I dontb know what to say at this point,” said
Rioki.

Murat Yakin said Saturday that Manuel Akanji was feeling empty after his saved penalty led to Switzerland being knocked out of Euro 2024 by England and missing out on a first-ever major tournament semi-final.
Switzerland lost 5-3 on penalties after holding England to a 1-1 draw after extra-time, and Akanji's opening spot-kick for his side was the only one not to be scored in the shoot-out.
""There aren't many words of solace. I said thank you to him for his performance, how he led the team today was of the highest level,"" Yakin told reporters.
""No words of solace can help him, there is a deep emptiness and deep sadness. Everyone needs to work through it but we can be proud of ourselves.
""Manu said he wanted to go first, you give players responsibility and you can't be angry with players like that.""
Switzerland looked set to reach the last four when Breel Embolo poked his team into the lead with 15 minutes remaining, only for Bukayo Saka to level the scores five minutes later.
And the manner of their performance at the tournament, in which they came within seconds of beating Germany and topping Group A and swept Italy aside in the last 16, gave Yakin reason to see the future in a positive light.
""Of course it hurts a lot when we made such an effort and had the chances we had. I'm very sad for the lads and the nation that after a performance like that we have to leave the tournament,"" added Yakin.
""We've seen the football we played against the big teams, we don't need to hide any more. We didn't get eliminated because we didn't do enough, we had the chances but penalties come down to luck.
""We caused a lot of problems for big teams so we shouldn't let our heads go down. You have winners and losers and unfortunately today we're not the winning team.""

A Ugandan TikTok content creator has been
jailed for six years for insulting President Yoweri Museveni and members of his
family.
Edward Awebwa, 24, was charged over content
he shared on his TikTok account 'Save Media Uganda' between February and March
2024.
The content was deemed ridiculous and
demeaning towards President Museveni, First Lady Janet Museveni, and their son Muhoozi
Kainerugaba, who is also Uganda’s Chief of Defence Forces.
Awebwa was accused of sharing information claiming
there would be an increase in taxes related to President Museveni.
He pleaded guilty to hate speech and disseminating misleading or malicious information last Friday.
In its ruling on Wednesday, the court noted
that the President, the First Lady and the first son should be respected.
“The accused is pleading for mercy but he
does not look remorseful at all for his acts, he is a person who was aware of
what he was doing and the court had an opportunity to even see the video, the
language that was being used was really vulgar,” Entebbe Chief Magistrate
Court’s Presiding Chief Magistrate, Stellah-Maris Amabilisi was quoted by the local
newspaper Daily Monitor as saying.
“This court is of the opinion that the
accused deserves a punishment which will enable him learn from his past so that
next time he will respect the person of the president, the first lady and first
son.”
The court added: “Taking into account the
five days he has already spent in remand, the court sentences the accused as
follows: six years imprisonment for each of the four counts, with the sentences
to run concurrently at Kigo Upper Prison.”
In 2022, Museveni, who has ruled Uganda since 1986, signed into law the Computer
Misuse (Amendment) Act, 2022, which provides for a jail term for anybody who
shares unsolicited offensive information or hate speech.
“A person who uses social media to publish,
distribute or share information prohibited under the laws of Uganda, or using
disguised or false identity, commits an offence,” the law states.
It defines offensive communication as the
“willful and repeated use of electronic communication to disturb or attempt to
disturb the peace, quiet or right of privacy of any person with no purpose of
legitimate communication whether or not a conversation ensues.”
The offence is punishable by a fine or
imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both.
However, rights groups and activists have
expressed discontent over it, arguing that it curtails press freedom and
freedom of speech and expression.
The law has been challenged in the court
and in January 2023, Uganda’s constitutional court ruled that section 25 of the
Act is inconsistent with the country’s constitution.
The court ordered that enforcement of the
law be halted immediately, including for all cases being prosecuted or
investigated.
In February this year, another Ugandan
TikTok content creator was arrested for allegedly abusing the Kabaka, the king
of the Kingdom of Buganda, and other kingdom officials in his videos.
Twenty-seven-year-old Ibrahim Musana, who
runs social media pages under the name ‘Pressure Pressure’, was accused of
defamation, promoting hate speech and incitement to violence.

President William Ruto's X Space appears to
be a must-attend for anyone who works for the government, as revelations show
that all the Cabinet Secretaries and almost all government parastatals will be
in attendance.
The Space, which the President hopes will be
his avenue to engage with the Gen Z directly and listen to their plight, is
slated to go down on Friday from 2pm to 5pm, despite widespread resistance from
thousands of Kenyans.
Various governmental bodies have already
rallied their followers to join the Space, some, surprisingly, including
entities which have traditionally stayed away from day-to-day government
policies.
The Kenya Forest Service, for instance, took
to X to hype up the Space, tweeting, ""#LetsEngage.
#JoinTheConversation.""
The Kenya Metreological Department, yet
another surprising entrant, joined in too, tweeting, ""Tune in today from
2-5PM EAT! His Excellency President @WilliamsRuto will be live on @XSpaces,
engaging with Kenyans.""
Almost every ministry in the Ruto
administration, too, has been going on overdrive, reminding Kenyans to join the
President's Space, with the hopes of shoring up numbers and creating the
perfect quorum for the Head of State.
The
ministries of Trade, Defence, Youth Affairs, ICT, Transport, Lands and more,
either through their official X account
or via the CSs in charge, have all posted or retweeted the President's Space
announcement, all appearing to repeat the same clarion call, ""Come, let us
reason together.""
A now viral screenshot doing rounds online,
which Citizen Digital cannot independently confirm, appears to show a
conversation in the official government communications WhatsApp group, urging
the members to rally everyone around the Space.
The text reads: ""Good evening
colleagues, take note of this presidential event happening tomorrow and plan to
attend. Mobilize the SM Teams in your Sagas to join in plus the staff, interns
and attaches in your Public Communication departments.""
Already, a tweet from the President's X
account appears to show that he will be the host. It reads, ""#EngageThePresident
. At 2PM.""
Reacting to the developments, one X user
said, ""Yaani wewe ndio host? So you've basically organised a little tea
party for you and your boys and now want us to join and watch you toast? LOL!
Get lost!""
Already, a section of Kenyans on X have vowed
to massively boycott the President's Space, instead preferring to host their
own parallel Space to counter the Head of State’s own engagement.

Published on: July 04, 2024 07:01 (EAT)
Portugal's forward #07 Cristiano Ronaldo and second goal-scorer, Portugal's forward #26 Francisco Conceicao celebrate on the pitch after the UEFA Euro 2024 Group F football match between Portugal and the Czech Republic at the Leipzig Stadium in Leipzig on June 18, 2024. (Photo by Adrian DENNIS / AFP)
Cristiano Ronaldo has been Portugal's main man for nearly two decades but the veteran forward is a long way from peak performance before Friday's Euro 2024 quarter-final showdown with France.
Now 39 years old and playing his club football in Saudi Arabia, Ronaldo is showing his age in what must surely be his last major international tournament.
Ronaldo's goalscoring prowess has been the hallmark of an incredible career in which for years he vied with Lionel Messi for the crown of the world's best player.
But he has failed to score a single goal in Germany and has not really looked like doing so in a series of displays which have added little to his country's attacking output.
Coach Roberto Martinez has started Ronaldo in all four of Portugal's matches in which he has set up a goal for Bruno Fernandes and done little else.
Ronaldo even put Portugal's chances of qualifying for the last eight in jeopardy when he missed a penalty against Slovenia on Monday as the match finished goalless and went to a shootout.
Martinez said Ronaldo ""paved the way"" for Portugal's eventual victory which set up Friday's match with Les Bleus by smashing in the first spot-kick.
""It was a victory for unity, from the dressing room,"" said Martinez.
""Cristiano is our captain and he showed that in life and in football there are difficult moments and we can't give up.
""We have to keep going and it was a demonstration of what to do when things aren't going well.""
But regardless of the courage Ronaldo showed to take the first penalty so soon after missing, it has been clear for a long time he is no longer the magnificent player he once was.
Ronaldo had burst into tears after failing to score in extra-time, and, overcome with emotion, apologised to fans after netting in the shootout.
""First it was sadness and then it was joy, that's what football gives you, inexplicable moments, a bit of everything,"" Ronaldo said.
""I didn't make a single mistake this year and when I needed something the most, Jan Oblak saved it.""
Ronaldo and Portugal will have to perform much better than they did against Slovenia if they are to get past an excellent French defence.
France's backline excelled in keeping Romelu Lukaku and Jeremy Doku quiet in their tight 1-0 over Belgium in the last 16, and is yet to concede a goal in open play in Germany.
Ronaldo has scored more European Championship goals than anyone else with 14, is the tournament's record appearance maker and is the only man to score in five straight Euros.
But he record-making days will be over if he is unable to find a way to click with his teammates, and Friday risks being a sad Euros farewell.

Romania coach Edward Iordanescu said he hoped his side's Euro 2024
run, where they topped Group E before Tuesday's last-16 elimination by the
Netherlands, could be a ""new beginning"" for the country's national
team.
Romania, who had only won one match in five Euros campaigns before
Euro 2024, topped a group featuring Belgium, Slovakia and Ukraine -- beating
the Ukrainians 3-0 in their opener.
The Romanians fought hard but were outclassed against the Dutch,
who won thanks to a brace from substitute Donyell Malen and a goal from
man-of-the-match Cody Gakpo.
""Of course there's some sadness. We wanted more but we did
give our all,"" said Iordanescu.
""They gave everything they have, the effort was total. They
were serious and united. These are lessons we can use. This cohesion between
Romanians and the national team could be a new beginning.""
Iordanescu, whose father Anghel was also a player and manager for
Romania before serving in the country's senate, began his coaching career at
Steaua Bucharest in 2010.
""Romania can do fantastic things,"" Iordanescu told
reporters after the match, adding: ""We have talent and potential. We have
to plan, develop, grow, the new generations, the children, they have to take
inspiration from these lads and see them as role models.""
The yellow-clad Romanians seemed to outnumber the orange of their
Dutch opponents, with supporters sticking around well after the whistle to
congratulate the team.
The coach pointed to a disconnect between the fans and the
national team which he hoped was closing with the side's efforts.
""We lost our spirit, our mentality. We forgot we need to work
hard and to be brave. We lost these things and at the end it hurt the bond
between the team and the fans.
""Eight
years without qualification, eight years of sadness for our fans. Then we came
here and the fans were behind us. I hope we don't forget these moments.""

United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has come
out to condemn the recent deaths meted out at anti-Finance Bill protests by the
Kenyan police.
U.N. human rights chief Volker Türk in a statement on
Thursday expressed concerns following the deaths of more than 20 people, as he appealed
to the government to exercise restraint and allow dialogue.
Commissioner Türk also called for a probe and accountability
by the government into the killings and injuries sustained by demonstrators.
“Saddened by recent deaths and injuries in the context of
protests, UN Human Rights Chief @volker_turk
urges restraint to facilitate the rights to peaceful assembly & expression,
and dialogue to listen to the voices of young people. Investigations &
accountability essential,” he stated.
The anti-finance bill protests which began last week have already led to immense loss of lives and property with about 29 people reportedly killed and over 300 injured.
Kenya Human Rights Commission, Amnesty International and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have condemned the government's use of excessive force while handling the youthful protesters saying they were keenly monitoring the situation.
IMF Director of Communications Julie Kozack noted that the agency
was taking a keen look at the country's situation while reaffirming its
position in assisting Kenya to overcome its economic challenges.
KHRC also noted that most of the killings occurred on
Tuesday night, pointing out that officers opened fire at protesters in
Githurai.

His family said Mutegi died peacefully on Thursday evening June 27, 2024, at around 7 pm.
“Dad was a remarkable man whose generosity, sense of humour, and dedication to his career left a lasting impact on everyone he met,” reads part of the statement.
Mutegi, whose illustrious media career spanned decades, worked at leading media houses including Royal Media Services.
Mutegi was a resident analyst on Citizen TV’s ‘Cheche’ power breakfast show.
Mutegi’s kin mourned him as the cornerstone of the family and a cherished figure in the community.
“We are currently in the process of arranging his funeral and will share the details within the next day or two. Your presence would be greatly appreciated as we gather to honour his memory,” the family said.
Mutegi, who mentored many journalists past and present, was known for his attention to detail and mastery of the trade.
“During this difficult time, please keep our family in your thoughts and prayers. We are deeply grateful for your continued support and for the love and friendship you extended to Dad throughout his life,” the family added.
Meanwhile, his former co-host David Makali took to social media to remember Mutegi.
“Devastated by the passing on of senior colleague, co-host and panelist Mutegi Njau. May your toil on this earth be rewarded and your memory last forever among those you mentored and gifted, or who savoured your goodness,” Makali said.
His journey in media began in 1979, with his passion blossoming from the days of Kenya's founding president Mzee Jomo Kenyatta.

Odemba in an interview with Citizen Digital on Wednesday revealed that they have so far signed three new players, and will be adding more as they aim to claim the Cecafa title.
The coach also hinted at releasing a number of players, to accommodate the new arrivals.
“We decided that we mix experienced players with junior players as a way of building talents and I’m happy that so far we have signed three junior players, and one senior player. Other senior players are expected to join immediately after we have kicked off our pre-season.
“As you know football is a business and because we are recruiting, we must also drop some players. We are sorry for the affected players but we have to do what is necessary to strengthen the team. We wish them all the best in their endeavours,” Odemba said.
The new faces at the Police Bullets camp include Mathare United Women midfielder Jane Hato, Vihiga Queens forward Emily Moranga and experienced midfielder Lourna Nyarinda Nyabuto, who previously featured for FK Apolonia Fier of Albania.
Odemba who doubles up as Harambee Starlets coach also revealed plans of a preseason tour outside the country ahead of the Cecafa tourney slated for August in Addis Ababa.
“A day ago we had a breakfast meeting with our Patron – the Interior Permanent Secretary Raymond Omollo and CS Ababu Namwamba and they underscored the importance of having a training camp outside the country. We were told to choose the place we want to set camp for the Cecafa preparations, and we are already in the process of doing that.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/next-commission-should-have-professional-honest-leaders-ruto-says-after-signing-iebc-amendment-act-n345496,"‘Next commission should have professional, honest leaders,’ Ruto says after signing IEBC Amendment Act
President William Ruto has assented to the Independent
Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) (Amendment) Bill, 2024.
Speaking after signing the new law at the Kenyatta
International Convention Centre (KICC) in Nairobi on Tuesday, Ruto termed the Act a testament to Kenya’s ability to navigate “difficult, complex and sometimes
divisive issues” that threaten national cohesion.
This is the first bill passed by Parliament
from recommendations by the National Dialogue Committee (NADCO) that was constituted
after a disputed 2022 presidential election results which saw a section of the
IEBC commissioners disown Ruto’s election victory results.
Its signing paves the way for the establishment of
the selection panel for the appointment of new IEBC commissioners.
President Ruto said new commissioners should
uphold the electoral body’s mandate of ensuring elections are managed transparently
and administered in an impartial, efficient, neutral, accurate and accountable
manner.
“I concur with leaders who have said there
must be professionalism and integrity as part of the cardinal principles of the
men and women who will be charged with overseeing our elections,” he said.
He at the same time told Parliament to process
the other recommended bills resulting from the NADCO report expeditiously, such
as the Conflict of Interest Bill, 2023 which seeks to reduce the risk of
corruption, favouritism and bias in the public service.
“I want to ask Parliament to expedite the
Conflict of Interest Bill that will support our anti-corruption measures,
especially among public officers,” said President Ruto.
Ruto was flanked by his deputy, Rigathi
Gachagua, Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi, Attorney-General Justin
Muturi, former Prime Minister Raila Odinga, former Vice President Kalonzo
Musyoka, National Assembly Majority Leader Kimani Ichungw’ah and Minority Leader
Opiyo Wandayi.
Odinga, who leads the opposition lawmakers,
said the Act comes at a time when Kenya is at a crossroads as a result of deadly
nationwide protests against taxation and President Ruto’s leadership.
“Most of the issues being raised by the
youth today are contained in the NADCO report. If it is implemented fully, it
will address all the issues Kenyan youth have raised,” said the former prime
minister.
He called for a wider engagement beyond committees
such as NADCO for Kenyans to “vomit all that is in their chests” to the
government.
Gachagua reiterated his call for Kenyans to
stop demonstrating and engage the government in dialogue, saying “I call upon
Kenyans to give dialogue and consultation a chance, get off the streets, stay
away from destruction of property because the country is greater than any of us.”
On his part, Ichung’wah said the new law is
an illustration that “through dialogue, we can talk and surmount all challenges
we face as a country.”

https://www.citizen.digital/lifestyle/new-hope-for-kidney-patients-as-kenya-explores-policy-on-organ-donation-by-deceased-persons-n345438,"New hope for kidney patients as Kenya explores policy on organ donation by deceased persons
The trips to hospital for dialysis sessions is a routine that Everline has familiarized herself with, she must be on dialysis for four hours twice a week.
Kidney disease comes with multiple challenges like swollen legs and back pains that Everline is battling, almost rendering her immobile.
Everline is supported by her husband to get into the car but it is a long struggle with the swollen legs she cannot lift herself to board the car. The husband places a stone for her to step on as he supported her into the car.
After a long struggle, Everline is at the hospital for her dialysis session. She must be supported out of the car again before she is wheeled to the dialysis room. After five hours, it is another uphill task getting her back to her house in Lucky Summer, Kasarani, where she will rest for only a day before going back for the dialysis session.
It is approximated that about 12,000 people have some form of kidney disease in Kenya and only half of these are on dialysis. From 2012 to 2021, the country has managed to do only 780 kidney transplants, which is way below the demand.
“The process of transplantation is guided by the law and at the moment the law gives guidelines and we can only live related donation and that is where we are at the moment so we have had a challenge of late because families are becoming smaller and smaller, long time we could get a family of 10-15 children at the moment the average is between 2-3 so the relatives are becoming smaller and smaller, DR. Patrick Mbugua, Head of Renal Unit at KNH notes.
Dr. Maurice Wakwabubi, the CEO of Kenya Tissue and Transplant Authority (KTTA) notes that Kenya has enough manpower to handle kidney diseases.
“The country has actually trained very many doctors, nurses and people around this area of kidney transplants but I think the problem that we are facing now is where do we get the organs?”
At the moment, Kenya is dependent on living-donor donations from immediate family members. Kenya's policy on donation, transfusion and transplant of medical productsthat is in the pipeline will go a long way in increasing access to organs for patients in need.
Cadaver Kidney transplant is a process where a kidney from someone who has recently died is removed with consent of the family or a prior consent from a deceased.
This process that happens when a patient has been assessed by doctors and pronounced brain dead, meaning the person can only live on life support.
In the UK, the law states that ‘all adults in England are considered as having agreed to donate their organs when they die unless they record a decision not to donate or are in one of the excluded groups in what is known as opt out system of organ donation.
According to the National Institute of Health, as of September 11, 2020, 4401 people were waiting for an organ in the UK.
A systematic review carried out in 2019, comparing the consent rates of opt-out organ donation countries versus opt-in countries, showed that the opt-out consent increased the deceased donation rate by 21–76% over 5–14 years, and deceased transplantation rate was increased by 38–83% over 11–13 years
In Kenya, the Ministry of Health, through the department of National Blood Transfusion, Tissue and Human Organ Service, initiated the process of developing a National policy on product donation, transfusion, and transplant in 2021, but it is yet to be completed to help thousands in need of Kidneys and other organs.
Everline, who has been waiting for a kidney transplant for seven years, has had three potential donors from her family, two were disqualified after several tests, and one who was her match chickened out at the last minute, this she says might be due to myths and cultural issues associated with organ donation in the country . She was left to bear dialysis and no other hope other than traveling outside the country for help.
“I had to talk to my parents and siblings because it is a rule in Kenya that the only person to give you a kidney is from your family, after that discussion one of my younger brother by then she was 23/24 years he agreed in 2017 after dialyzing for one and a half years but we didn’t match so he was dropped. In 2018 I picked another brother, we went through all the tests until stage 6 but he developed high blood pressure again he was dropped, then my younger sister in 2022 everything was compatible we were okay until the day we were going to be admitted at the hospital for the procedure, she never showed up when I came back to the house she had left and she blocked me. I really felt bad am still on this journey you know my mind was set soon I will be reforming from my normal life, I was depressed for 3 months I was not talking to anybody,” Everline notes.
Dr. Wakwabubi notes that relying only on living donors is not enough.
“You cannot be able to sustain that is why you cannot be able to help the population so they entered into what we call deceased organ donation US is leading followed by spain whereby when you die you can be able to say that my organs i can be able to donate to somebody as you die you gift somebody with a life these countries have done that and they have done well,” he says.
According to medics, patients on Kidney transplantation live a better life than patients on chronic dialysis. Stakeholders in the health sector are calling on the government to follow the first-world countries on cadaver organ harvesting to address the shortage and save Kenyans like Everline from the agony.
“If I get money or i get help from friends and family i can go to india they harvest the kidneys from accident people or maybe somebody wrote a will,” says the patient.
Dr. Wakwabubi notes that KTTA has come up with a policy on the same.
“ We have a bill which is now ready many countries outside they are ready to partner with us to help us in terms of technology transfers in terms of helping us to set up these programs,” the expert notes.
Dr. Mbugua, the Head of Renal Unit at KNH says there is a committee sitting looking at the guidelines.
“This course is something that needs to be looked at very critically as far as the law is concerned. Because we are talking about patients who have had probably very bad accidentS, they are brain dead but their organs are perfect,” he explains.
“I really want to do this transplant thing, I really want to do it they should change this law, they should change it to anybody and have the awareness to people anybody can give a kidney and survive with one yaani Kenyans to come up,” Everline says.
Almost 60 km from Nairobi,the bumpy road leads us off Malaa Centre to a small village in Machakos County. We meet Keren Gioko and her two siblings, they are getting ready for school, a few years ago, Kenyatta National Hospital was Keren’s second home after she was diagnosed with kidney disease at the age of 4, she was on dialysis just like Everline,, twice every other week.
“I underwent peritoneal dialysis for 3 months, then after 8 years the disease recurred again in 2022 march I went to KNH and i started dialysis for 11 months the doctor suggested that I should do a transplant,” Karen states.
Keren’s father Stephen Gioko notes that the family had a challenge in finding a match.
Keren was lucky that after several medical tests, her father was eligible to donate his kidney. It was a relief for her ending multiple trips to the hospital for dialysis, and she was closer to living a normal life.
“You know its not easy to find a donor so I am thankful that my father offered to donate his,” Keren states.
Even though Keren is now living a better life than she would with dialysis, she will be on immunosuppressant medication for the rest of her life.
Immunosuppressant medicine is taken by patients who receive donor organs to stop their bodies from attacking or rejecting the donated kidney because the immune system will see it as a “foreign” organ and will always attack it
Failure to follow the doctor’s advice will lead to the donated kidney being attacked and the patient will be back on dialysis.
Teachers at ACK Mukengesya secondary school in Matungulu constituency are aware of Keren’s routine, and help her to ensure adherence to the drugs.
“We laid strategies on how to cope with the girl in school and we talked about diet and even the activities in the school what she can do and what she can’t do,” Samson Ngulu- Principal- Mukengesya Secondary School states.
Keren’s father notes that the costs of the drugs has been reducing with time.
In Sabaki area of Mlolongo in Machakos County, 66-Year-Old Captain George Maundu narrates to us how kidney failure halted his career for some time, but after two years on dialysis, his younger brother volunteered a kidney to him.
“I am a commercial pilot by profession and just to kind of give a purview of good transplant is of course I had been grounded on medical grounds I couldn’t fly of course with kidneys failed and on dialysis but the recovery was so complete that after like six months after the surgery I was actually able to be medically examined and qualified to be reissued with my flying license,” Maundu says.
According to the department of National Blood Transfusion, Tissue and Human Organ Service at the Ministry of Health, more than 7,000 Kenyans who are currently on dialysis have either failed to get a donor and a number of them are running away from the post-transplant cost. The National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) is paying for up to Ksh. 76,000 per week per patient on dialysis but can not cover post-transplant care
“NHIF is ready to pay Ksh. 76000 per month to keep someone on dialysis but if somebody goes for transplant they are not willing to pay Ksh. 35,000 because they say it is not their policy so they will refuse to pay your medicine but should your kidney fail again due to lack of medication you will have to go back to dialysis they are ready to pay they are paying so that is the kind of logic that has baffled some of us that somebody will pay Ksh.76k a month but they don’t want to pay 35k but should your kidney fail which it will due to lack of medication they will pay,” Maundu notes.
In developed countries like the UK, organ donor registers are used to record an individual’s organ donation preferences.
The register is checked by a specialist upon the death of a potential donor and the deceased’s preferences are then discussed with their family and other close relatives. If they object to donation, then the National Health Service stresses that donation will not proceed.
Patients like Everline who are on the waiting list for Kidney donation are hoping and praying that the National Assembly of Kenya will discuss and pass the organ donation bill as soon as possible to allow them access to organs and save their lives.

African javelin record holder Julius Yego says he will do all
he can to stage a better show in this year’s Paris 2024 Olympic Games that will
be held from July 26 to August 11.
While expressing on social media his delight at making the
cut for the quadrennial games through rankings, Mr. YouTube as he is popularly
known has termed the prospect of participating in his fourth Olympic Games as
added motivation to do well this year.
“The run to
qualify for the Paris Olympic has been the most difficult one for me! But am
happy I finally made in the rankings.
“God made it
happen for me and am so grateful for this.
“Compounded with
injury in April at Kip Keino Classic, which I must admit made my dream of
competing in my fourth Olympic time and I almost lost hope.” Read his
post on Facebook.
Yego’s performances in the Olympics have been littered with
injuries, with his best record being in the 2016 Rio de Janeiro games, where he
won silver with a throw
of 88.24 m, despite only throwing once after picking up a right ankle
injury.
In
Tokyo 2020, the former world champion failed to register a legal throw in his
first two attempts before making 77.34 m in his third throw, effectively locking
him out of the games.
“Now
down to diffident task ahead as part of team Kenya to Paris.
“I
will give my best short at this fourth milestone appearance at the Olympics.
“I
also congratulate all my fellow Kenyan sportsmen and women on the team.
“Let’s
make Kenya proud.” He added.

https://www.citizen.digital/tech/microsoft-ditches-openai-board-observer-seat-n345589,"Microsoft ditches OpenAI board observer seat
Apple which last month announced bringing OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT to its devices, would not take the observer role on OpenAI's board after being widely expected to do so, the Financial Times reported, citing a person with direct knowledge of the matter. Apple did not respond to a request for comment.
An OpenAI spokesperson said the company will establish a new engagement approach by hosting regular stakeholder meetings with strategic partners such as Microsoft and Apple and investors such as Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures.
Microsoft took a non-voting, observer position on OpenAI's board in November last year after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman took back the reins of the company which operates the generative AI chatbot ChatGPT.
The seat meant it could attend OpenAI's board meetings and access confidential information but had no voting rights on matters including electing or choosing directors.
The observer seat and Microsoft's more than $10 billion investment in OpenAI have triggered unease among antitrust watchdogs in Europe, Britain and the U.S. over how much control it exerts over OpenAI.
Microsoft cited OpenAI's new partnerships, innovation and growing customer base since Altman's return to the startup for giving up its observer seat.
""Over the past eight months, we have witnessed significant progress by the newly formed board and are confident in the company's direction. Given all of this we no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary,"" it said in a letter to OpenAI dated July 9.
EU antitrust regulators last month said the partnership would not be subjected to the bloc's merger rules because Microsoft does not control OpenAI, but they would instead seek third-party views on the exclusivity clauses in the agreement.
In contrast, the British and U.S. antitrust watchdogs continue to have concerns as well as questions about Microsoft's influence over OpenAI and the latter's independence.
Microsoft and OpenAI are increasingly competing to sell AI technology to enterprise customers, aiming to generate revenue and demonstrate their independence to regulators to address antitrust concerns.
Additionally, Microsoft is expanding its AI offerings on the Azure platform and has hired Inflection's CEO to head its consumer AI division, a move widely interpreted as an effort to diversify beyond OpenAI.

In the past week, Kenyans online have sought
to hold the government to account to assess how taxpayers' money is spent.
One of the key aspects that has since been highlighted
is Ksh.900 million spent by the Meru County Executive during the first nine
months of Financial Year 2023/2024.
This is according to a report by the
Controller of Budget dated April 2024.
The report disclosed that Meru County spent
Ksh.342 million on domestic travel during the period, comprising Ksh.182
million spent by the County Assembly and Ksh.159 million by the County
Executive.
For foreign travel, the County Assembly spent
Ksh.42 million while the Governor Kawira Mwangaza-led Executive spent a
whopping Ksh.903 million.
The report sampled various destinations by the
County Assembly and displayed how the County Assembly spent
their funds.
These included destinations to Australia
(Ksh.1.6 million), Tanzania (Ksh.1 million), Dubai (Ksh.1 million), Kampala
(Ksh.2.5 million) among others.
In total, the County Assembly went to Arusha
in Tanzania 14 times and spent a total of Ksh.28 million.
Kenyans have since poked holes into the
amount, questioning how the Governor Kawira administration spent Ksh.900
million in only nine months.

Residents of Mtwapa were left foaming at the mouth after police inadvertently fired teargas canisters inside Mtwapa sub county hospital during Tuesday demonstrations.
According to the residents, the police were tackling rioters who had gathered outside the Chief’s Office, not far from the hospital, when police reportedly fired teargas canisters at the lot, two of which ended up landing inside the maternity ward area, and the clinic.
There was tension at the hospital’s maternity ward as those affected condemned the ineptitude of the police.
“This is a health facility and it's well marked. There are many patients here, we didn’t go out to riot. Why are they doing this to us, yet we have newborn children, and expectant mothers here in the maternity ward,” said Miriam Wambui, a resident of Mtwapa.
A remorseful area OCPD is said to have walked to the facility, and picked the exploded remnants of the teargas canisters.
He then apologised to the affected patients, the hospital administration and staff present.
The OCPD also reportedly spoke to the hospital administrator before leaving the facility.
A number of areas were on Tuesday affected by riots as Kenyans took to the streets to express their disaffection regarding the Finance Bill 2024, that has since been dropped.
Riots have been reported in Mombasa, Nairobi, Nakuru, Kisumu, Migori, Kisii, Machakos, Trans Nzoia and other areas across the country.

https://www.citizen.digital/tech/google-is-broken-how-an-algorithm-tweak-cost-livelihoods-n345023,"'Google is broken': How an algorithm tweak cost livelihoods
Online businesses have been left considering layoffs and even site closures after Google's massive upgrade in March and April caused catastrophic drops in traffic.
Gisele Navarro is one of the unlucky ones whose website got caught up in Google's dragnet.
The 37-year-old Argentine runs the HouseFresh website with her husband, and they had been building a healthy niche in product reviews for air purifiers since 2020.
There were no ads, no product placements and no soft-pedalling -- if a product was bad, the site's reviewers would say so.
They earned commissions from clickthroughs to Amazon.
But Google's update changed all of that.
""We found that we went from ranking number one -- because we were one of the only people who had actually done a review -- to not even showing up,"" she told AFP.
HouseFresh used to get around 4,000 referrals from Google search a day, but this has since collapsed to around 200.
The dropoff in business has been so bad that Navarro said she had been advised to shutter the site and start over with a new domain name.
- Updates 'helpful' -
Underpinning the frustration for Navarro and many other sites is the lack of clarity over how Google ranks results.
The US firm is notoriously secretive about its algorithms -- so much so that an entire industry known as ""search engine optimisation"" has grown up trying to game the algorithm to get more clicks.
The latest update sent SEO experts into a tailspin, desperately trying to unpack why some sites were boosted and others getting downranked.
Google told AFP in an email that its update was designed specifically to give users ""fewer results that feel made for search engines"".
""The only changes we launch are ones that our experiments have shown will meaningfully improve results for people. And we do believe that these updates have been helpful,"" Google said.
Yet Navarro showed in a widely shared blog post in May that people searching for product reviews were increasingly being fed ads and content that appeared to be AI-generated or SEO-maximised.
- 'Tough market' -
Other material boosted by Google's update included user-generated content from websites like Reddit and Quora.
Google defended this approach saying ""people often want to learn from others' experiences"", adding: ""We conduct rigorous testing to ensure results are helpful and high quality.""
But staff at one European news website said their articles were now being routinely outranked by largely irrelevant content from Reddit.
The site publisher, who asked for anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the topic, said referrals from Google had plummeted by between 20 to 30 percent since the update -- and cutbacks would be inevitable.
""In an already tough market this is a serious problem for independent publishers like us,"" they said.
All the businesses AFP talked to said they were now urgently seeking ways to avoid relying on Google search -- whether by writing newsletters, making podcasts or finding other ways to attract audiences.
The boss of a fintech news outlet, who spoke to AFP anonymously fearing adverse effects on their business, said their competitors all employed SEO firms ""to buy traffic"".
""We don't do that but it's getting harder to hold that position as those sites didn't fall anywhere near as much as ours after this Google update,"" they said.
Navarro, who has had to reduce her staff drastically, has pivoted to video reviews and newsletters to try to reconnect with her audience.
And despite her experience with Google, she remains an optimist about the web.
She has been heartened by the many messages of support, and an uptick in referrals from alternative search engines like DuckDuckGo.
""The entire knowledge of humankind is on the web -- and that's worth something,"" she said.
""I don't want to give up on it just because Google is broken.""

In the undated video which has since gone viral, Maalim, while speaking in the Somali dialect, said that if he were the President of Kenya he would have ""slaughtered"" 5,000 young protesters every day.
A verified video translation reveals that the legislator was censuring the Kenyan Gen Zs for their attempt to march to State House during the anti-finance Bill 2024 protests.
He claimed that the young people who took the streets were from wealthy backgrounds and were dropped off in the capital with the sole purpose of causing mayhem.
""This was an attempted coup, a clear attempted coup. Children of wealthy business owners, wealthy parents and kids raised on ill-gotten wealth, 80% from one tribe were dropped off in downtown and told to riot and take over State House and Parliament buildings,"" he said.
Maalim blatantly noted that if he reigned over the nation he would have wiped them out in their thousands.
""God forbid if I was president I would have slaughtered them, 5,000 of them daily. Serious, there is no two ways about it,"" he said.
Despite keen observations clearly showing that the video was not tampered with, Maalim has claimed that the video has been doctored and is misinforming.
He was forced to clear the air on the video during an interview with KTN News on Tuesday, where he said that his adversaries are working against him.
""It's all editing, cutting and pasting, taking a word from here, another one from here and putting it together. There is a lot of nonsense there. It's Somalis basically who would do that because I weighed in on their politics. It's not the true picture,"" he said.
Maalim delved into a scattered defence of his comments, noting that his statement was in protest against the attacks on critical national facilities and nations which have had similar invasions have descended into anarchy.
""The one thing I said is...when you say that you're taking over State House, you're occupying State House and you're occupying Parliament, two constitutional institutions that are a bedrock on the stability of the country and the democracy that we practice,"" he said.
""I'm actually trying to sound serious alarms in saying that these headless things called a popular movement, a revolution, we've seen it in many places and we've seen it in Sudan, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Somalia, and the results are always invariably devastating.""
Attempts to reach Maalim for his comment were futile.

Hundreds of heavily armed police officers were deployed in and outside State House, Nairobi in a 360-degree-like deployment, to safeguard the seat of power.
Roadblocks were erected along all roads leading to the house on the hill and traffic re-diverted causing major inconveniences.
The protester's primary objective was to occupy State House as part of escalating protests against the finance bill, signaling a lack of confidence in President William Ruto's administration.
By 6 am, police officers had positioned themselves on all roads leading to State House and cordoned off the structure.
Several layers of security personnel were deployed to maintain the safety of State House, with patrols around its perimeter operating continuously.
Motorists heading to town from Lavington and Kileleshwa were redirected at the Dennis Pritt round about as police set up initial roadblocks disrupting traffic flow.
The most affected were those using the Riverside and Arboretum sections, who were redirected back towards Uhuru Highway.
Processional Way was out of bounds to all members of the public with police mounting barricades and turning away pedestrians and motorcycles attempting to use the road. Accessing State House road through Jakaya Kikwete Road was also out of bounds.
Throughout the day, there was no visible traffic entering or leaving State House, indicating low activity during the Thursday protests.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/biden-acknowledges-age-says-he-intends-to-defeat-trump-after-rough-debate-n344884,"Biden acknowledges age, says he intends to defeat Trump after rough debate
""I'm here in North Carolina for one reason because I intend to win this state in November,"" Biden said at a rally in the battleground state one day after the head-to-head showdown with his Republican rival, which was widely viewed as a defeat for the 81-year-old president.
""I know I'm not a young man, to state the obvious,"" an ebullient Biden said, encouraged by a crowd chanting, ""Four more years.""
""I would not be running again if I didn't believe with all my heart and soul that I could do this job. The stakes are too high,"" Biden said.
Biden's verbal stumbles and occasionally meandering responses in the debate heightened voter concerns that he might not be fit to serve another four-year term and prompted some of his fellow Democrats to wonder whether they could replace him as their candidate for the Nov. 5 U.S. election.
For his part, Trump, 78, put forward a series of falsehoods and deflected questions throughout the debate, but much of the focus afterwards was squarely on Biden, especially among Democrats.
Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic Party leader in the U.S. House of Representatives, avoided answering directly when asked if he still had faith in Biden's candidacy.
“I support the ticket. I support the Senate Democratic majority. We're going to do everything possible to take back the House in November. Thank you, everyone,” he told reporters.
Other Democrats said they would assess their options in the days to come. Asked if they should look for another nominee, Representative Jim McGovern said: ""I haven't come to any conclusion yet.""
The Biden campaign said it raised $14 million on Thursday and Friday and posted its single best hour of fundraising immediately after the Thursday night debate. The Trump campaign said it raised $8 million on the night of the debate.
Biden, already the oldest American president in history, faced only token opposition during the party's months-long nominating contest, and he has secured enough support to guarantee his spot as the Democratic nominee.
Former President Trump likewise overcame his intra-party challengers early in the year, setting the stage for a long and bitter general election fight.
Three columnists from the New York Times' left-leaning opinion section called on Biden to drop out of the race.
One Biden donor, who asked for anonymity, called his performance ""disqualifying"" and predicted that some Democrats would revisit calls for him to step aside.
That would give the party time to pick another nominee at its national convention, which starts on Aug. 19 -- a potentially messy process that could pit Kamala Harris, the nation's first Black female vice president, against governors and other officeholders whose names have been floated as possible replacements.
“If he made this decision, it’s important that we use it to our advantage,” Democratic Representative Katie Porter said at a conference in Colorado.
Democratic officials played down that possibility.
""It's not likely to happen,"" Biden campaign co-chair Mitch Landrieu said on CNN.
One campaign staffer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they were frustrated by Biden's performance and hoped it would prompt top strategists to re-think their approach.
But other aides and allies said privately they did not think the blowback would threaten his chances of winning the nomination.
Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other senior Democrats - including possible replacements like California Governor Gavin Newsom - said they were not abandoning Biden.
""Stay the course. Chill out,"" Representative Jim Clyburn said.
A BAD NIGHT FOR BIDEN, UNDECIDED VOTERS SAY
Interviews with undecided voters confirmed that it was a bad night for Biden. They described his showing as feeble, embarrassing and difficult to watch.
The Trump campaign released a video on Friday highlighting Biden's stumbles. ""Last night the world saw who he is. He is unfit to serve,"" spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said.
One Republican adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the debate would help them compete in Democratic-leaning states like Virginia and Minnesota.
Trump fundraisers said they were fielding enthusiastic calls from donors. ""Anyone who raises money knows there's a time to go to donors, and this is one of those watershed moments,"" said Ed McMullen, who served as ambassador to Switzerland during Trump's presidency.
As Trump supporters lined up hours ahead of a rally in Virginia, some said they were struck by Biden's poor performance. “I’m scared they are going to replace him and put up somebody more competitive,” said Mike Boatman, who said he had attended more than 90 Trump rallies.
Questions about Trump's fitness for office have also arisen over his conviction last month in New York for covering up hush money payments to a porn star, his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his chaotic term in office.
The 90-minute debate at CNN headquarters in Atlanta took place more than four months before the election. That could mitigate the damage for Biden, as the memory of his performance fades and news events generate fresh headlines.
Trump, for instance, is scheduled to be sentenced in New York on July 11, just days before his party convenes to formally nominate him. He still faces three other criminal indictments, though none appears likely to reach trial before November.

Published on: July 04, 2024 09:43 (EAT)
Sean ""Diddy"" Combs attends Invest Fest at Georgia World Congress Center on August 26, 2023, in Atlanta. PHOTO/COURTESY: CNN
Superstar rapper and music industry mogul Sean Combs has been sued by a former adult film star for sexual assault and sex trafficking, court filings showed.
Combs is the target of several civil lawsuits that characterize him as a violent sexual predator who used alcohol and drugs to subdue his victims, and his homes were raided this year by federal agents.
The hip-hop artist, known as both Puff Daddy or Diddy, used actress Adria English as a ""sexual pawn for the pleasure and financial benefit of others"" during his lavish ""White Parties"" in the Hamptons and Florida between 2004 and 2009, the complaint alleges.
The latest lawsuit, filed in Manhattan on Wednesday, brings to nine the number of claims against Combs since November 2023.
""Given all the brave individuals who have come forward against Defendant Combs, (English) is doing the same,"" the complaint said.
English is seeking a jury trial and undisclosed damages, according to her complaint.
""Due to these numerous lawsuits filed against Defendant Combs alleging the same or similar acts, there is now a growing awareness that Defendant Combs was engaging in far more sinister acts than previously known including physical abuse and sex trafficking,"" the complaint says.
In March armed agents entered Combs' sprawling luxury properties in Miami and Los Angeles, a heavily publicized bicoastal operation that suggested an investigation into the rapper is underway.
Disturbing surveillance video emerged in May showing Combs physically assaulting his then-girlfriend Casandra Ventura, corroborating allegations she made in a now-settled lawsuit late last year.
Ventura sued Combs in federal court last fall, a bombshell suit that was settled out of court but succeeded by a string of similarly lurid sexual assault claims against the hip-hop star.
Combs has vehemently denied all accusations against him. His lawyer did not immediately respond to an AFP request for comment on the latest lawsuit.

https://www.citizen.digital/entertainment/kecobo-claims-artists-royalty-collection-hit-ksh22m-in-10-days-but-ezekiel-mutua-says-its-just-ksh5k-n345257,"KECOBO claims artists' royalty collection hit Ksh.22M in 10 days, but Ezekiel Mutua says it's just Ksh.5K
The
Kenya Copyright Board (KECOBO) has announced a surprising jump in royalty collection
for Kenyan musicians, from a supposed previous Ksh.600,000 to a record high Ksh.2.2
million.
KECOBO,
in a statement released on Thursday, said the total collection as at June 18,
2024, stood at Ksh.22 million.
This,
it noted, came just 10 days after the sole licence to collect royalties was issued to the Performing and Audio-Visual Rights Society of Kenya (PAVRISK).
The
move effectively relieved the other two previously existing Collective
Management Organizations (CMOs) – the Music Copyright
Society of Kenya (MCSK) and the Kenya Association of Music Producers (KAMP)
- of the mandate.
“The
Board notes that following the issuance of a Collective Management Organization
license to Performing and Audio-Visual Rights Society of Kenya (PAVRISK),
collection of royalties from music users has increased from a daily collection
of Ksh.600,000 to Ksh.2.2 million daily,” stated KECOBO.
“As
at June 18, Ksh.22 million had been collected. This was 10 days after the
issuance of the licence. This was an improvement from the collections that was
being done previously by the three CMOs jointly.”
The
Joshua Kutuny-led board went ahead to project the daily royalty collection to
grow to Ksh.3 million, further noting that it is in the process to establish
recording studios in all 47 counties.
It
also stated that it is in talks with relevant government ministries to come up
with a programme that will enable Kenyan artists to obtain loans at relatively
lower rates.
“The
daily collection is expected to rise to Ksh.3million daily with introduction of
an enhanced system and support from music users. The Board encourages
transparency in the collection and distribution of royalties by the CMO to help
cut on costs and increase royalty distribution to artists to at least 70
percent of the collection,” noted KECOBO.
“The
Board is in the process of engaging the Ministry of Cooperatives and Micro/
Small and Medium Enterprises Development to establish artists and creatives'
savings cooperative society (SACCO) that will give artists an opportunity to
borrow at a lower rate.”
MCSK
boss Ezekiel Mutua has since, however, come out to contest KECOBO’s daily
collection figures, further accusing the board of disregarding court orders in
a case it supposedly filed after the sole collection licence was issued to
PAVRISK.
According
to Mr. Mutua, it is not even remotely accurate to claim that PAVRISK could have
collected anything more than a meager Ksh.5,000 within three weeks.
“When the country is burning
because of the arrogance and incompetence of public officials, you are here
disobeying court orders and lying to the public to please your corrupt
paymasters. Shame on you,” he wrote on X.
“PAVRISK has collected less
than 5k in three weeks. You claiming it's over 20M. What does it take for your
useless state corporations to know that it's not business as usual in Kenya?”

Volkswagen shares slipped on Wednesday after an overnight profit warning triggered in part by the possible closure of an Audi plant and a 3.8% drop in second quarter sales dented by China.
Deliveries in China were down by nearly 20% amid a wider decline in sales of combustion engine cars which still make up the majority of Volkswagen's line-up in the country.
As China heads speedily to an all-electric market, Volkswagen has said it will be raising its battery-powered offerings in coming years and prioritising profitability even as rival local carmakers slash prices up by to 50%.
""We do not expect an easy year,"" a spokesperson told reporters.
The company lowered its 2024 operating return on sales forecast to 6.5-7% from 7-7.5% and said the Audi brand was considering closing its Brussels site, which employs about 3,000 people, due to low demand for its higher-end electric cars.
Volkswagen shares were down 1.13% at 105.4 euros at 1030 GMT, contributing to a 5.5% fall so far this year.
Finding an alternative use for the plant or closing it, as well as other expenses, would cost up to 2.6 billion euros ($2.8 billion) this financial year, Volkswagen announced.
A consultation process is now ongoing on finding alternative solutions for the site, it said.
The future of Audi's Brussels plant was thrown into question earlier this year after the carmaker said the follow-on model to the Q8 e-tron would be built in Mexico.
Rising orders for newer models such as the Q6 e-tron coming to market this year had led to a sharp drop in interest in the older Q8 e-tron produced in Brussels, Audi said on Tuesday.
Audi has struggled to catch up with premium carmaker competitors BMW and Mercedes in the transition to electric vehicles.
""Products like the first generation Q8 e-tron were halfway solutions - not the full clean sheet like Audi has done with its new premium electric platform,"" said Stephen Reitman of Bernstein Research. ""The potential of the Q6 is higher.""
Audi has promised a refresh in 2024 and 2025 with over 20 new EV and combustion engine models, followed by EV-only models from 2026.
Volkswagen, which has strong union representation, has not closed a plant in four decades, but analysts said the carmaker was under pressure to reduce significant amounts of excess production capacity.
""Given the low margin on first quarter results, now is the time to negotiate with unions,"" said Daniel Schwarz of Stifel Research.
Some analysts welcomed the news of the possible plant closure as a sign the carmaker is addressing its costs and excess capacity.
""People worry because the headline figures play into the concern that VW is in trouble. but this is a business with too much cost and they're addressing that,"" Philippe Houchois of Jefferies said.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/eacc-slams-senator-ledama-over-alleged-misinformation-on-conflict-of-interest-bill-n345222,"EACC slams Senator Ledama over alleged misinformation on Conflict of Interest Bill
The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission
(EACC) has called out Narok Senator Ledama Ole Kina for making “false, malicious
and misleading information” in regards to the Conflict of Interest Bill, 2023,
and the agency's alleged role in its enactment.
This comes three weeks after Ledama's
proposed amendments to the Bill were okayed by the Senate and returned to
Parliament for approval before being forwarded to the President for final
assent.
The amendments to the Bill will allow State
officials to engage in government contracts while simultaneously protecting
themselves and their families from taxpayer accountability, dealing a
significant blow to anti-corruption efforts spearheaded by the EACC.
In a statement on Thursday EACC CEO Twalib
Mbarak noted that apart from verbally attacking the commission, Ledama made
false allegations and misled Kenyans about the content of the Bill and the
implications of the amendments introduced by the Senate.
EACC added that Ledama attempted to justify
the Senate's unanimous adoption of his amendments by dismissing it as a
worthless creation sponsored by the anti-graft watchdog in collaboration with
an international organization.
""Whereas the commission has legitimate
interest in all anti-corruption legislation, including those pending in
Parliament, the commission takes great exception to the Senator's allegations
that it sponsored the Bill, whether on its own motion or on behalf of the
alleged international actors. The Senator was, therefore, out of order in
imputing improper motive on the Commission,"" said Mbarak.
Further, EACC highlighted that the Bill was sponsored by the Cabinet as a measure to combat corruption, and was tabled by the Majority Leaders of both Houses of Parliament.
""To that extent, therefore, Senator
Olekina lied to Kenyans apparently to shift public focus from the disastrous
nature of the amendments introduced to the Bill which, in effect, cripple the
fight against corruption perpetuated through conflict of interest, especially
in the counties,"" said Mbarak.
""Whereas the commission does not
ordinarily respond to politicization of its work, blackmail and intimidation by
its detractors, the gravity of the Senator's false allegations regarding a
matter of such great public interest and national importance, cannot be
permitted to stand. This obligates the commission to set the record straight
and call out the Senator for the dishonest conduct.""
EACC further urged political leaders to
desist from politicizing the fight against corruption but rather support it by
strengthening legal frameworks to address current legal bottlenecks that are
inimical to public accountability.
""In particular, the commission calls
upon Parliament to consider dropping all the amendments introduced by the
Senate to the initial Bill which pose a direct threat to the existing
mechanisms for protection of public funds from theft and misuse,"" added Mbarak.

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/demiral-double-sends-turkey-into-euro-2024-quarters-at-austrias-expense-n345090,"Demiral double sends Turkey into Euro 2024 quarters at Austria's expense
Merih Demiral was Turkey's unlikely hero with both goals in a 2-1 win
over Austria on Tuesday that booked their place in the Euro 2024
quarter-finals.
The Al-Ahli centre-back smashed home after just 58 seconds and produced
a towering header on the hour mark to double Turkey's lead.
Michael Gregoritsch quickly pulled a goal back for Austria and only a
stunning save from Mert Gunok denied Christoph Baumgartner a dramatic equaliser
deep into stoppage-time.
Turkey advance to face the Netherlands in the last eight in Berlin on
Saturday.
Austria had emerged as dark horses to go far on the perceived weaker
side of the draw after topping a group including France and the Netherlands.
Ralf Rangnick's side had also thrashed Turkey 6-1 in a friendly in
March, but this time they failed to recover from a nightmare start.
Real Madrid's Arda Guler was a constant threat to the Austrian defence
and his teasing delivery from a corner caused chaos inside the first minute.
Baumgartner's clearance off the line hit team-mate Stefan Posch,
goalkeeper Patrick Pentz clawing it out to Demiral, who lashed into the
roof of the net for the second fastest goal ever at a European Championship.
Turkey's raucous fans exploded in a deafening celebration, but they were
nearly brought back down to earth straight away.
Baumgartner fired inches wide form the edge of the box before Demiral
somehow prevented the RB Leipzig midfielder from scoring at his home ground as
a dangerous Austrian corner flashed across goal.
Turkey coach Vincenzo Montella said that absent captain Hakan
Calhanoglu, who was missing due to suspension, was ""irreplaceable.""
However, Guler assumed responsibility in the playmaking role and nearly
produced a stunning second for his side with an audacious attempt from the
halfway line that drifted wide.
Only Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands have had a higher winning
percentage in European football since Rangnick took charge of Austria two years
ago.
The former Manchester United boss made two changes at half-time,
including the introduction of Gregoritsch, who scored a hat-trick when the
sides met three months ago.
Rangnick got the reaction he desired as Austria began cutting through
the Turkish defence.
Gunok spread himself brilliantly to deny Marko Arnautovic when
one-on-one before Bayern Munich's Konrad Laimer lacked the finish to a fine run
through the middle.
However, they failed to learn their lesson from Guler corners as another
inviting delivery was powered home by Demiral.
In doing so the 26-year-old became the first European defender to score
twice in the knockout stages of a major tournament since Lillian Thuram for
France at the 1998 World Cup.
It was also a set-piece at the other end that got Austria back in the
game seven minutes later.
Posch flicked on Marcel Sabitzer's corner for Gregoritsch to sweep high
into the net.
A torrential downpour could not drown out a sensational atmosphere in
Leipzig, with Turkey's huge expat population in Germany again making it like a
home game for Montella's men.
The fervent atmosphere turned sour as Sabitzer was struck by an object
thrown from the crowd as he prepared to take a corner.
Baris Alper Yilmaz was denied a third for Turkey by a fine save from
Pentz in stoppage-time.
That nearly proved crucial as Gunok then had to produce a remarkable
stop to prevent Baumgartner's downward header finding the far corner.
It was an incredible save reminiscent of England keeper Gordon Banks'
iconic stop from Pele in the 1970 World Cup.
But Turkey stood firm amid
an aerial bombardment from Austria to reach the quarter-finals of a major
tournament for the first time since Euro 2008.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/turkey-criticizes-potential-spread-of-israeli-military-operations-to-lebanon-border-n344751,"Turkey criticizes potential 'spread' of Israeli military operations to Lebanon border
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan criticized what he said Wednesday were Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s plans to “spread the war” in Gaza to the region.
“Israel is now setting its sights on Lebanon and we see that Western powers behind the scenes are patting Israel on the back and even supporting them,"" Erdogan told lawmakers.
Netanyahu has said the “intense phase” of fighting against Hamas in Gaza will end soon and Israeli forces will redeploy to the northern border where Israel and the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah have been trading fire for months.
Netanyahu has cast the shift as defensive.
U.S. officials this week have expressed their own opposition, warning Israel against moves that could expand the conflict.
U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant that a heightened conflict between Israel and Hezbollah could touch off a regional war. Austin urged a diplomatic solution as he hosted talks with Gallant on Tuesday.
""Another war between Israel and Hezbollah could easily become a regional war, with terrible consequences for the Middle East,"" Austin said.
""Diplomacy is by far the best way to prevent more escalation.""
Gallant, speaking before meeting with Austin, said, “We are working closely together to achieve an agreement, but we must also discuss readiness on every possible scenario.”
Israel’s army said last week that it has plans ""approved and validated"" for fighting Hezbollah.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also urged Israel to avoid escalation in Lebanon when he met with Gallant on Monday.
Israel and Hezbollah last fought a full-scale war in 2006 when a cross-border Hezbollah attack sparked 34 days of fighting that took a heavy toll on Lebanon, especially the country's southern region.
Gallant also met with CIA chief Bill Burns, the key U.S. official in negotiations to free hostages held by Hamas.
The war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials, and led to the capture of about 250 hostages.
Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 37,600 Palestinians, mostly civilians, but including thousands of combatants, according to the territory's health ministry.

Published on: June 30, 2024 03:44 (EAT)
Kenya's Emerging Stars lost 2-0 to Comoros in their second match of the ongoing Cosafa Cup in South Africa, at the Isaac Wolfson Stadium Sunday afternoon.
Reduced to 10 men in the 33rd minute after Paul Ochuoga was shown a red card after a second yellow, Kenya still fought hard but the effort was just not enough to match Comoros who took advantage of their numbers.
Affane Djambae was twice on target to give Comoros the important win, which took them to three points, having lost the opener to Zimbabwe.
In his post-match remarks, Stars coach Ken Odhiambo said the red card was a big blow to their plan in the match.
""We were left off balance after the red card and the penalty. It affected how we wanted to play, as the opponents who were also good in their show took advantage to get the result,"" said the Harambee Stars assistant coach.
Coming off a confident 2-0 victory over Zambia, Kenya hoped to continue their winning streak. However, the day unfolded with unexpected twists, as Ochuoga, the only change in Kenya's lineup that faced Zambia was bookled within the first 10 opening minutes. A miscommunication at the backline proved costly for Kenya in the 33rd, the lapse resulting in a penalty and a second yellow card for Ochuoga.
Djambae stepped up and coolly converted the penalty, putting Comoros ahead.
The second half started with Kenya trying to regroup, but Comoros struck again swiftly. In the 49th minute, a miskicked shot from Comoros midfielder Ali Mze landed at the feet of Djambae, who made no mistake in doubling their lead.
Trailing by two goals, Kenya adopted a more defensive stance, cautious not to concede further. Despite this, Comoros continued to press and created multiple scoring opportunities which were however not converted.
Zambia, the only side with zero points at the publishing of this account, take on Zimbabwe Sunday evening seeking to draw level with the rest of the teams in the group (three points) should they win.

KSSSA: Chavakali High eye Western Region football title soccer team commenced their training earlier this week ahead of the
Western region Kenya Secondary School Sports Association (KSSSA) Term II Games
slated for Bungoma next week.
Chavakali
coach Hillary Muleri said the players are in camp except Bret Greig, who
suffered a minor fracture on his leg during county competitions at Mumboha
against Senende Boys.
“We
don’t want to participate but to compete.
“Our
fans' support encourages us to soldier on, and our players who take in
instructions well are determined to make Vihiga proud,” Muleri said.
Muleri
revealed that his opponents would use high balls to muddle up his playing
style, a weakness he will address before Western games kick off next Wednesday.
“Remember,
at the County level, we only lost twice to Ebwali. They couldn’t let the ball
settle on the pitch, managing to disorganize us. But I picked my lessons.
“I
must prepare adequately for opponents not used to short passes moving forward,”
Muleri stated.
In
2018, Chavakali qualified for regionals only to exit in the semifinals, where
they lost to Bungoma’s Bukembe.
Chavakali
would return to the regionals in 2022 but lost 5-4 on post-match penalties to
Ebwali after a barren draw during the regulated time.
This
year, Muleri’s side is pooled alongside Bungoma’s Kibabii, Munyuki from
Kakamega, and John Osogo from Busia County in pool A.
“My
objective is to qualify for the nationals, but I expect tough opposition from
Musingu.
“I
cannot also write off Ebwali because they beat us in 2022 when they bagged the
national soccer trophy,” the Chavakali tactician stated.
Chavakali
skipper Blair Milambo is upbeat that this is the year for Chavakali to stamp
their authority in the secondary school soccer competitions.
“While
others celebrate because they qualified for the regional games, we must this
year go past the regionals and win the title,” Milambo said.
Apart
from football, Chavakali High School will also feature in Rugby, Volleyball,
and Basketball in Western Region championships.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/ichungwah-withdraws-land-laws-amendment-bill-from-parliament-n344943,"Ichung'wah withdraws Land Laws amendment Bill from Parliament
National Assembly Majority Leader Kimani
Ichung'wah has written to Speaker Moses Wetangula announcing the withdrawal of the
controversial Land Laws (Amendment) (Number 2) Bill, 2023, which sought to
impose land rent on freehold land owners and property owners who enjoy free
ownership.
In a letter dated June 13, Ichung’wah says there is a myriad of constitutional and legal issues arising from the Bill and ""no further consideration of the Bill should be undertaken.""
""During the meeting of the House
Business Committee, I had notified the Committee not to prioritize the
consideration of the Bill to allow for consultations with the Ministry of Lands
and Physical Planning and the National Land Commission,"" it reads.
The Majority Leader continues: “…the
Executive had further advised on the need for the ensuing issues to be
addressed and resolved before further consideration of the Bill.
“Having consulted with the relevant
stakeholders, this is now to confirm that the Majority Party has withdrawn the
Bill. Consequently, I request that the House Business Committee be notified of
the withdrawal of the Bill and that no further consideration of the Bill should
be undertaken.”
The Bill, sponsored by Ruiru Member of
Parliament Simon King’ara, sought to amend the Land Act of 2012 by inserting a
new section immediately after Section 54, which states that the owner of any
freehold land within the boundaries of any urban area or city shall pay an
annual land levy equivalent to the land rent charged on a comparable leasehold
property of the same size in the same zone.
It could give the Lands Cabinet Secretary
power to acquire land compulsorily whenever the county or the national
government determines a need to acquire a piece of
land.
However, experts warned that if enacted,
the amendments could see hundreds of Kenyans lose their property to the
government.
According to Dr Mwenda Makathimo, the
Executive Director of the Land Development and Governance Institute (LDGI),
this translates to taxing Kenyans for owning land in urban areas.
“This means the government is charging you
a tax for owning freehold land which is not government land. That is what this
Act will bring. The land you might have inherited from your parents or land
that you might have bought is freehold land,"" he told Citizen TV.
“Imposing this annual levy on land that is
freehold property essentially has the effect of converting freehold property
into leasehold property and by that, running the risk of dispossessing many
Kenyans who may not afford to pay the levy and this includes Indigenous people
whose lands are ancestral,"" Eva Makori, Acting Regional Coordinator,
International Land Coalition (ILC) Africa added.
While Ichung'wah previously claimed that there was
no such a Bill, Citizen TV established that the Bill had gone through
all the steps at the National Assembly and to the Senate.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/deadly-kenya-protests-spurred-by-international-debt-woes-n344888,"Deadly Kenya protests spurred by international debt woes
“Kenya is not IMF’s lab rat,” was just one of
many slogans condemning the International Monetary Fund that was seen this week
on demonstrators’ placards at protests in Kenya against proposed tax hikes.
The protests, fueled by tech-savvy youth on
social media, were sparked by the Kenyan government’s plans to significantly
raise taxes to pay off its enormous debt.
The government did a U-turn after things
turned deadly Tuesday when protesters broke into parliament in Nairobi and
police opened fire, killing over 20 people, according to rights groups.
Embattled President William Ruto announced he
was listening to the protesters’ concerns and was scrapping his controversial
finance bill. He said he would instead introduce budget cuts and austerity
measures to try to shore up the country’s finances.
But the chaotic events in one of Africa’s
major economies, also a key U.S. ally, have led to questions about the debt
choking many developing countries, and who is to blame.
International
financial institutions
Kenya owes $80 billion in domestic and
foreign debt. Its debt stands at 68 percent of GDP, well above the World Bank
and IMF’s recommended maximum of 55 percent.
The tax hikes in Ruto’s unpopular bill were
aimed at avoiding default and came after an agreement earlier this month
between Kenya and the IMF on a comprehensive reform package.
Most of Kenya's debt is owed to international
bondholders, while its biggest bilateral creditor is China, to which it owes
$5.7 billion.
Washington frequently accuses Beijing of
“debt trap diplomacy” — unscrupulous lending that leaves developing countries
overly burdened. China, which has undertaken large infrastructure projects
across Africa under President Xi Jinping’s global Belt and Road Initiative,
vehemently rejects the allegations.
Experts have different takes on whether China
or Western monetary institutions are to blame for Kenya’s current woes. Kenya
owes billions of dollars to Western countries and the IMF as well as China.
“The key culprit is the lack of a well-functioning
global financial safety net,” said Kevin P. Gallagher, director of Boston
University’s Global Development Policy Center.
“Programs from the International Monetary
Fund and World Bank made the situation worse, rather than better, and the flaws
in the G20 Common Framework to work out debt problems were seen as too risky
for Kenya to enter into,” he said, referring to the debt restructuring
mechanism that other indebted African countries like Zambia and Ghana have been
using.
Gallagher said China’s loans to Kenya have
decreased in recent years, according to his university’s data, and it has
little to do with the East Africa country’s debt woes.
“Indeed, the Kenyan case disproves
accusations of ‘debt-trap diplomacy’ on the part of China. If China was doing
debt trap diplomacy it would be seizing Kenyan assets, instead Chinese capital
has been the most patient during these rough times,” Gallagher told VOA.
David Shinn, a former U.S. diplomat, said the
blame couldn’t be placed on any one factor.
“China is the largest bilateral lender, but
its loans are quite modest when compared to the international financial
institutions and holders of Eurobonds,” he told VOA.
“All of these players share the blame for too
much debt. The Kenyan government should not have allowed itself to take on so
much debt and those who offered loans should have been more circumspect,” he
continued.
Alex Vines, director of the Africa Program at
Chatham House, was also even-handed, saying, “China is part of the debt burden,
but private equity is also contributing to the overall burden.”
Aly-Khan Satchu, a Kenya-based economist,
said Kenya was “in a perfect debt storm.”
“You know you’d get whiplash for looking at
Kenya’s politics. From a period of looking east, we’re back to looking west
again … and therefore a big decision has been made to wrestle Kenya away from
the Chinese orbit, with the support of the World Bank and the IMF.”
However, Satchu said, one of the problems is
that Kenya has had to reroute some of the IMF and World Bank’s money in order
to pay its debts to China, particularly for a Chinese-built railway.
Harry Verhoeven, a senior researcher at
Columbia University, told VOA neither China nor the IMF is uniquely responsible
for Kenya’s problems.
“I think the IMF is not wrong in its
diagnosis that there’s not enough revenue being raised, I think that’s
certainly right,” he said. “Where you can be more critical of the IMF is, so
far at least, that it hasn’t spoken up very much … about the distributional
effects of how that revenue should be raised, or what the government has
proposed to raise it.”
Analysts note it wasn’t just loans that got
Kenya into its fiscal predicament. The country was hard hit by the COVID-19
pandemic and has also suffered from the fallout of Russia’s war on Ukraine —
which has seen global food and energy prices rise. Climate change-induced
floods have also hurt the country’s economy.
Samuel Misati Nyandemo, a senior economics
lecturer at the University of Nairobi, said the Kenyan government, having
withdrawn the controversial finance bill, now has a tough road ahead.
“The government should try to balance between
raising revenues and address the cost of living and doing business in the midst
of entrenched corruption, impunity and wastage of public resources,” he said.
Kenya, he warned, might not be the last
African country where frustrations boil over and citizens take to the streets.
In impassioned remarks in April,
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, “the world cannot afford to
continue throwing developing countries’ plans and futures onto a raging bonfire
of debt.”
He said around 40% of the world’s population
now live in countries that spend more on interest payments than health or
education.

The MP spoke while meeting with pub owners in Karatina town who have been affected by the closures.
According to the MP, the closure of the bars has impacted other businesses that rely on them to stay afloat.
""When my people have been oppressed, I will speak, when I see they are about to finish Karatina, I speak, that is the job the people who elected me gave me,"" the MP said.
The MP contended that some of the pub owners had taken out large loans to start their businesses and were now on the verge of being auctioned, while others were suffering from massive rent arrears.
The MP also called on the Mathira East and West District County Commissioners, as well as the Karatina OCPD, to stop harassing the business owners.
The outspoken MP demanded that any officials, including local chiefs, sent to shut down bars carry a letter explaining the closure.
Businesspeople who spoke at the forum called for the bars to reopen, claiming that the closure was affecting others, particularly bartenders and hawkers who sell their wares inside the drinking establishments.
Local MCAs however read malice into the war on illicit liquor, now pitting the country's second-in-command against his area MP.
According to them, the MP is being used by forces seeking to weaken the DP's fight against illegal spirits and substance abuse.
The latest development comes just a day after Gachagua criticised some leaders, including the Ministry of Interior, for opposing his initiative to end the illicit brew menace in the Mt. Kenya region.
Gachagua claimed that those who oppose the fight are tarnishing President Ruto's legacy, particularly now that the fight against illicit drugs has gained traction.
Gachagua played an important role in Wamumbi's election as Mathira MP in 2022, as he was set to succeed him when Ruto chose him as his running mate.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/what-do-gen-zs-want-n344851,"What do Gen Z want?
For the past two
weeks, Gen Z has been protesting against the Finance Bill 2024. Eventually, their
efforts bore fruits, the president conceded and rejected the bill on Wednesday,
June 26th.
Many thought that the youth would be satisfied however, their rage was still palpable. They took to various social media platforms mostly X, formally known as Twitter, to express their dissatisfaction with President William Ruto's government begging the question ‘What do Gen Z`s want?”
Speaking on Citizen TV's Daybreak show, the youth voiced their needs, stating that they want accountability, transparency of funds, and promises kept.
”During your campaign, you had an obligation and you committed to improving the standards of living for the people of Kenya those policies do not resonate with what you are telling us,” said lawyer Hassan Mahmud Ibrahim.
“Two years ago you came and told us this is the change we want to bring. You sold us hope and the government said we will come and work, but this has not happened,” said Wendy Loyce political activist.
Lawyer Hassan Mahmud Ibrahim was of the opinion that the government should focus
mostly on implementation rather than dialogue. He said that the President was
very categorical in his speech stating that he has heard the youth hence his
actions should reflect his words.
“I want to wake up tomorrow and hear the issue of JSS teachers has been solved. I want to wake up tomorrow and hear the issue of intern doctors has been solved. I want to wake up and hear the issue of abduction has been resolved in this country,” said Ibrahim.
“We feel that there is laxity in implementations of what the youths may want or what the people of Kenya want.”
Philip Mwangale, a governance analyst, moreover stated that for dialogue to work there needs to be leaders who are well capable of executing the needs and wants of the people.
“We cannot have a dialogue with a cabinet that is 85% corrupt. We cannot have dialogue with a National Assembly that is almost 50% corrupt. You have three murders in the National Assembly today people who have murdered. It’s not an allegation they have murdered, how do you dialogue with such people,” said Mwangale.
Loyce further noted that the protests were a result of the continuous pleas of the youth falling on deaf ears. She echoed that the youth had had enough of empty promises from Members of Parliament and those in power
“This generation has come up and said wait a minute no it will no longer work like this, I elected you to go to this office and this is our true voice,” said Loyce.
The youth have been called to continue keeping up the good spirit of fighting, stating the uniting factor should always be patriotism and at the end of the day, the course should end up bringing people together.
They have further called on the government to realise that the people of Kenya are supreme and should be accountable to the people of Kenya. They also want more funds allocated to the counties.

Portugal goalkeeper Diogo Costa saved three Slovenia penalties to earn his side a 3-0 shoot-out victory after Cristiano Ronaldo redeemed himself from the spot in a dramatic Euro 2024 last 16 clash on Monday.
Portugal forward Ronaldo broke down in tears after missing a penalty in the first period of extra-time in the goalless tie in Frankfurt.
But he recovered to convert in the shoot-out as Portugal scraped through to set up a blockbuster clash with France in the quarter-finals.
Slovenia battled valiantly to keep Portugal at bay, with Jan Oblak making a stunning save to keep out Ronaldo's penalty after Diogo Jota was fouled.
However, Ronaldo, Bruno Fernandes and Bernardo Silva all scored in the shoot-out and Slovenia's trio missed, sending the Selecao through in heart-stopping fashion.
Portugal coach Roberto Martinez reverted to a more familiar 4-3-3 system after his side were embarrassed by debutants Georgia in their last group game when he deployed three at the back.
The Euro 2016 winners dominated the ball and created their first chance after 12 minutes when Silva's inviting cross just evaded Ronaldo and Fernandes could not turn home at the far post.
Slovenia, playing in their first ever knock-out match at a major competition, maintained their defensive shape well and limited Portugal's opportunities.
Former Real Madrid striker Ronaldo directed a soft header at his old nemesis, Atletico Madrid keeper Oblak, under vital pressure from Vanja Drkusic.
The Slovenian defender was booked moments later for bringing down the surging Rafael Leao as he charged towards Oblak's goal.
Ronaldo smashed the free-kick narrowly over the bar with the goalkeeper at full stretch.
Slovenia produced their first effort on target just before half-time when RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko fired at Costa from the edge of the box.
Portugal's holding midfielder Joao Palhinha hit the outside of the post with a low drive, the final kick of the first half, after more good work by the menacing Leao.
Ronaldo forced a solid stop by Oblak with another venomous free-kick early in the second half as the Al-Nassr forward tried in vain to break down Slovenia's defensive wall, which comfortably held England to a goalless draw in the group stage.
Matjaz Kek's side had a golden chance to take the lead on a rare burst forward, but Sesko dragged wide after beating the oldest player in the competition's history, 41-year-old Pepe, for pace.
Still determined to score, Portugal captain Ronaldo thumped yet another free-kick over the crossbar with 20 minutes remaining.
The striker had a chance to settle the game in open play with two minutes to go but, in down the left, could only shoot straight at Oblak, leading to extra-time.
- Oblak thwarts Ronaldo -
The pace dipped in extra-time and the first period was uneventful, until the 103rd minute when Jota barged into the area and went down over Drkusic's leg for a penalty.
Ronaldo fired it hard to Oblak's left but the goalkeeper produced a stunning save to deny him, tipping his effort against the post and out.
In half-time of extra-time, Ronaldo was in tears after his miss, and Portugal fans sang his name to try to raise his shattered morale.
Slovenia missed another huge opening of their own when Pepe gave the ball away with a loose pass and Sesko stole it to race through on goal.
The forward fired too close to Costa who produced an excellent save with his leg, forcing a penalty shoot-out -- Slovenia's first ever.
Slovenia went first and substitute Josip Ilicic's effort was brilliantly saved by Costa.
Ronaldo buried his kick and asked for forgiveness from the fans behind the goal for his extra-time miss, before Costa saved Slovenia's second from Jure Balkovec.
Costa made a third consecutive penalty save from Benjamin Verbic after Fernandes converted and Silva won it as he sent Oblak the wrong way.

In a statement by Felix Koskei, head of Public Service, the committee will include representatives of the youth, civil society, religious organisations, professional bodies, business community organisations, academia and student leadership.
The committee will also be composed of majority and minority leaders of parliament, Council of Governors and other stakeholder groups.
“Each umbrella body is requested to formally nominate two representatives of either gender for consideration for appointment to the National Steering Committee (NSC). The nominations should be addressed to the Executive Office of the President, Harambee House,” the statement read in part.
The nominations are expected to be received by the Executive Office of the President on or before July 7, 2024.
According to Koskei, the committee shall be tasked with providing the framework, modalities, agenda and timelines for a nationwide dialogue on the issues raised by the youth.
Talking Points
Some of the matters highlighted include jobs, nation’s tax policy, national debt burden, representation and accountability, anti-corruption measures and any other agenda items deemed appropriate.
Following the establishment of the Committee, President William Ruto will facilitate the first sitting of the forum to identify the leadership. Thereafter, the forum will carry out its activities independently across the 47 counties through a participatory process in every ward.
“In keeping with our national values and principles of governance on public participation, every Kenyan and all stakeholders will have an opportunity to present their proposals on the agenda items in person, remotely, individually or as groups,” the statement read in part.
“The NSC will also provide a framework and mechanism for engaging with political leaders in a bipartisan manner.”

Barely
a day after he hosted a delegation of Catholic bishops at State House, Nairobi,
President William Ruto has now hosted their counterparts from the African
Independent Pentecostal Church Africa (AIPCA).
President Ruto, in a statement posted on X on Saturday, said he met 96 AIPCA bishops led by Presiding Archbishop Samson Muthuri for what he termed as multi-sectoral talks including youth unemployment.
He
underscored the government's commitment to creating job and income
opportunities for the youth through various strategic programmes and policies.
""The
government has deliberate programmes and policies to create job and income
opportunities for our young people. These include the Affordable Housing
Programme, digital jobs, labour migration and industrialisation through county
aggregation and industrial parks and special economic zones,"" said Ruto.
""The
proposed youth and multi-sectoral forums will give the youth and other
stakeholders a platform to discuss these and other national economic challenges
that face our country.""
On
Friday, Ruto hosted Kenyan Catholic bishops at State House, Nairobi, for what
he said was a conversation to come up with solutions to the country’s problems.
The
delegation of the clergy, President Ruto said in a post on X, was led by
the Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops (KCCB) Chairman Archbishop
Maurice Muhatia.
“We
welcome the commitment by the Catholic Church to participate in a
multi-sectoral engagement that seeks solutions to the issues facing our
country. Through this collective approach, we will move Kenya forward,” he
wrote then.
The
meeting came amid clamour from Kenyans online to delink politics and religion,
with a prominent social media activist launching a campaign to rid churches of politicians in
a move dubbed ‘#CleanTheAltar.’
Activist
Mwabili Mwagodi kicked off the campaign which has seen him directly text or
call church pastors and bishops and personally urge them to disinvite Kenyan
politicians - including the President - from their functions.
The
clamor has led to the cancellation of several planned church functions, including
a fundraiser event at the Lavington United Church which was scheduled to be
attended by First Lady Rachel Ruto.

An Eldoret court has reviewed the cash bail
of Jonathan Paul Mutua, a looting suspect arrested during anti-tax protests in the
town.
When the suspect appeared in
court on Tuesday, the court initially issued him a Ksh.10 million bond without
the option of cash bail.
The terms sparked outrage online,
prompting the intervention of Embakasi East MP Babu Owino who dispatched his
lawyer Aseso Omollo to take over the case and seek a review of the bond terms.
The court, upon review on Wednesday, released
the suspect on a cash bail of Ksh.200,000, with the option of a Ksh.150,000
bond.
According to court papers, the review came
after the cost of the items reportedly stolen was considered.
Previously, Mutua had been granted a bond of
Ksh.10 million without a cash bail alternative for allegedly stealing items
during the recent anti-tax protests in Eldoret.
He was accused of breaking into
the Baniyas Club Square owned by Fredrick Kamau and stealing items valued at
Ksh.37,093,690.
The items stolen included
television screens, computers, printers, gas cylinders, chairs, a restaurant
couch, utensils, food, charcoal, 181 kilogrammes of beef steak, 17 bags of
charcoal and 12 bags of potatoes.
Mutua, 29, however denied the
charges when he appeared before Eldoret Chief Magistrate Cherono Kesse.
The case has been set for mention on
July 15, 2024.

This reimagined version, titled “Nibebe 2.0,” once again features the soulful vocals of Nyota Ndogo who carries the tune with the same mastery and emotion she did ten years ago.
Peppered with a melange of Coastal and urban vibes, Nyota Ndogo proves that, a decade later, her artistry and powerful vocals are still just as fresh.
The song also showcases Nonini’s ability to reinvent himself, blending his youthful romantic ballad with a mature perspective that resonates with today’s audience.
Produced by Ogopa DJs, “Nibebe 2.0” marks the first time the rapper has collaborated with Lucas of Ogopa DJs, despite the historic competition and rivalry between Calif Records and Ogopa DJs during Nonini’s heydays.
An additional feature on the new track is the guitars which were expertly played by Nonini’s American musician friend, Jordan, adding a unique and international flavor to the classic.
Even in the new version of the classic, Nonini’s keen eye for classic and exemplary music videos is evident.
“Nibebe 2.0” continues this tradition of high-quality production, making it a visual and auditory delight for both old fans and new listeners.
With a decorated career spanning nearly three decades, Nonini stands as one of Kenya’s pioneering music icons.
His immeasurable influence has extended beyond music into the fashion industry with his own apparel line, Mgenge 2ru, which he proudly adorns in the music video.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/no-dialogue-kenyan-youth-maintain-demand-justice-for-killed-protesters-n345538,"‘No dialogue!’ Kenyan youth maintain, demand justice for killed protesters
In yet another display of defiance, young
activists across the country have rejected any negotiations with the government
regarding the nation's future.
Instead, they say they are resolute in their
pursuit of justice for their fallen comrades. Their demand: accountability from
the authorities.
They spoke on Tuesday in Thika during the burial of
David Chege, a young protester who lost his life outside Parliament buildings during
demonstrations on June 25, 2024.
The air crackled with tension as fellow
protesters, including human rights defenders, paid their respects. Chege's
casket lay draped in the flag of Kenya, a symbol of both pride and tragedy.
“David is a modern-day freedom fighter, he
was armed with the flag and they murdered him. Before June 25th, this flag was
only flying in minister’s cars and government buildings during holidays. But because
of David’s death and many others, this flag is now liberated,” said activist
Boniface Mwangi.
The crowd, united in grief, demanded justice.
Their voices aimed at those in authority, the Kenya kwanza administration.
“As the President says
about dialogue, we can’t dialogue without justice, without compensation. So
before they say they want to talk with the Gen Zs, you need to acknowledge that
your government killed young people. You need to apologize to those families,
then you can talk about dialogue,” added Mwangi.
Chege, who was an IT expert, was also
remembered as a Sunday school teacher.
His brother Brian Njuguna shared memories of
his life, telling mourners that Chege had stepped out for his first protest on
the fateful day.
""David came
out on 25th, his first protest ever…he came out to fight for rights of children…
he taught, including police officers,” recounted Njuguna.
Chege's fate was sealed by a bullet to the
head; a casualty of the very system he challenged.
The government's silence spoke volumes, but Chege’s
legacy endures. According to the young mourners, he is not just another
statistic, he is a hero - an emblem of resilience.
“David will go down
in the books of history; he is special, ni shujaa. I hope you keep your heads
held high. Just because they’re killing us, just because justice isn’t served,
it’s not the end, and I’m glad the family knows that,” stated activist Hanifa
Adan.
Njuguna added: “David
was actually in the last phase of his Visa application process to go work in
Germany. It was in the final stages, he had gotten a job opportunity there.”

https://www.citizen.digital/news/ruto-announces-6-day-national-dialogue-over-issues-affecting-kenyans-n345502,"Ruto announces 6-day national dialogue over issues affecting Kenyans
President William Ruto on Tuesday announced
a six-day multi-sectoral dialogue forum beginning Monday, July 15, to discuss
issues pressing Kenyans.
Ruto told journalists at the Kenyatta
International Convention Centre (KICC) in Nairobi that the forum will draw
representatives from political parties, religious groups, civil society,
employers and youth.
“In the interest of making sure we live
within our means; all participants will bear their attendance costs. This is a
result of consultations we have held this morning,” he said.
Stakeholders will be required to submit
their representatives by Friday this week, Ruto added.
The President said the forum “will propose
the way forward for the country.”
Ruto spoke after assenting to the
Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) (Amendment) Bill, 2024.
The Bill stemmed from recommendations by
the National Dialogue Committee (NADCO) constituted after a disputed 2022
presidential election results which saw a section of the IEBC commissioners
disown Ruto’s election victory results.
Former Prime Minister Raila Odinga, who
leads opposition lawmakers, backed Ruto’s dialogue push, terming it “the best way
forward out of the crisis we are having today as a country.”
“We will give people an opportunity to be
heard,” Odinga said, adding that it will provide a platform for Kenyans to air
their grievances and table issues they think are ailing the country towards “a lasting
solution.”
“There are many issues affecting Kenyans but
all of them are solvable,” said the former prime minister.
“Unemployment, corruption, ethnicity, debt
and the management of the economy are issues we need to talk about.”
The forum comes in the wake of deadly
nationwide protests against taxation and President Ruto’s leadership.
The protests began last month against the
unpopular Finance Bill, 2024 through which Ruto’s government sought to raise an
additional Ksh.346 billion in revenue through increased taxation.
But they have persisted even after Ruto
declined to assent to the proposed law on June 26 after public pressure.
Over 39 people were killed in the
demonstrations, according to the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights.

Sports Cabinet Secretary Ababu Namwamba has come under
pressure to disclose the non-athletes accompanying Team Kenya to the Olympic Games
in Paris.
In a demand letter to CS Ababu, three Kenyans want
the ministry to release full details on the travelling party, failure to which
they will seek legal action.
The petitioners, Charleen Njuguna, Jolly Lanji
and Baverlyne Kwamboka, through their lawyers, have written to Sports CS Ababu
Namwamba expressing their concern on the cost on Kenyans of the composition of
the delegation to the games.
“…Our clients are active citizens who, from the
Rio experience, are concerned about the true cost of Kenya's delegation to the
Paris Olympics. The Olympics run from Friday, 26 July 2024 to Sunday, 11 August
2024.”
""Under Article 35(2)(b) of the Constitution
and section 4 of the Access to Information Act, 2016, our clients formally seek
the following information from you: A list of all non-competitive participants
travelling at public expense with the official Kenyan delegation to the Paris
Olympics.”
The three also want to know how much each of the
unnecessary hangers-on are being paid as allowances and their roles in the
games.
“A schedule of the individual roles of each of
the non-competitive participants travelling at public expense with the official
Kenyan delegation to the Paris Olympics and a schedule of the allowances and
sustenance costs for each of the non-competitive participants travelling at
public expense to the Paris Olympics.”
The petitioners have given the CS seven days
from July 8, 2024 when the letter was written, failure to which they will seek
the court’s intervention to enforce the request.
This comes a few days after President William
Ruto flagged off a team of participants to the Summer Games.
The letter also comes after CS Ababu over the
weekend unveiled the official kit for the Kenyan Olympics team, which caused much furore online with Kenyans blasting the
designers for what they have termed as cheap and ugly outfits.

The father of Tottenham Hotspur star Son Heung-min on Wednesday
denied allegations of physical and verbal abuse at his South Korean football
academy, after a student's family sued him and his coaches.
Son Woong-jung, a former footballer who shot to prominence in
South Korea thanks to the success of his striker son, runs a training academy
for aspiring players.
Son senior has also authored a best-selling memoir, outlining his
football philosophy and detailing how he helped his son become one of the best
strikers in the English Premier League.
South Korean media reported Wednesday on allegations of physical
and verbal abuse made by one of his football academy's students, who claimed a
coach hit him with a corner flag during training, causing injuries that
required weeks of treatment.
Son senior, 62, acknowledged the incident had occurred, but denied
it amounted to physical abuse.
""This incident was not corporal punishment but a mutually
agreed event as part of fitness training,"" he said in a statement.
The player came last in a race, he said, and was supposed to be
""hit once"" on the thigh.
The incident came to light after the young player's parents
reported Son senior to the police in March after they noticed a bruise on their
son's thigh.
They provided a photograph of the purported injury, which was
published by South Korea's Yonhap news agency.
""Thinking about how frightened my son must have been makes me
angry,"" the father said, Yonhap reported.
""I decided to report the case to the police because I didn't
want to see another case like this.""
Son senior said he had tried to resolve the matter amicably but
failed because the parents had demanded a settlement worth hundreds of millions
of won (hundreds of thousands of dollars).
""We are currently awaiting a fair legal judgement based on
facts,"" he said in the statement.
Son admitted his coaching methods had failed to follow new
standards concerning players' human rights.
""I
will self-reflect in atonement for having insisted on my method while failing
to catch up with the boundaries set by the change of times and laws.""

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/taliban-dont-recognise-women-on-afghan-olympic-team-sport-official-n345437,"Taliban don't recognise women on Afghan Olympic team: sport official
Afghanistan's Taliban government does not recognise the three
female athletes who will represent the country at the Paris Olympic Games this
month, a spokesman for their sports department said.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has invited a squad of
six Afghan athletes -- three women and three men -- in consultation with
Afghanistan's largely exiled national Olympic committee.
""Only three athletes are representing Afghanistan,"" said
Atal Mashwani, the spokesman of the Taliban government's sports directorate,
referring to the male competitors.
""Currently, in Afghanistan girls' sports have been stopped.
When girls' sport isn't practiced, how can they go on the national team?""
he told AFP.
All three of the women and two of the male athletes are living
outside Afghanistan.
The only one training in the country is a judo fighter, whilst his
squad mates will feature in athletics and swimming.
The IOC said it had not consulted Taliban officials about the team
and they were not invited to the games.
Spokesman Mark Adams last month confirmed Afghanistan's national
Olympic committee -- including the president and secretary-general who are both
living in exile -- remain ""its sole interlocutors for the preparation and
participation of the Afghan team"".
But Afghan committee CEO Dad Mohammad Payenda Akhtari, who is
still in the country, said whilst female athletes were organised abroad, his
committee coordinated with Taliban authorities over the male ones.
Mashwani claimed the government was supporting them with training
and scholarships.
""We only take the responsibility for three male athletes
participating in the Olympics,"" he told AFP.
The participants will compete under the black, red and green flag
of the old Western-backed government which crumbled after the withdrawal of US
troops three years ago.
Since surging back to power in 2021, the Taliban government has
enforced curbs squeezing women out of sport as well as secondary schools and
universities.
The United Nations has described the restrictions as ""gender
apartheid"".
The IOC banned Afghanistan from the games in 1999, during the
first period of Taliban rule between 1996 and 2001 when women were also barred
from sport.
Afghanistan was reinstated after the Taliban were ousted by the
post-9/11 invasion, but the Paris games mark the first summer Olympics since
their return.
This
time the IOC has taken a different approach -- approving the Afghan team under
a system ensuring all 206 nations are represented, in cases where athletes
wouldn't otherwise qualify.

Ollie Watkins struck a stunning injury-time winner as England beat the Netherlands 2-1 on Wednesday to set up a Euro 2024 final showdown with Spain in Berlin.
It was an incredible finish to an evening that began badly for England, as Xavi Simons gave the Netherlands an early lead in the semi-final in Dortmund.
However, England were soon level through a Harry Kane penalty following a contentions VAR call by German referee Felix Zwayer, and the match looked set to drift towards extra time until Watkins struck.
On for Harry Kane, Watkins received a pass from fellow substitute Cole Palmer with his back to goal in the first minute of stoppage time, turned and fired low into the far corner to leave the Netherlands completely stunned.
It has rarely been a convincing campaign from Gareth Southgate's England side, but they are through to their second consecutive European Championship final as they dream of finally winning a first major trophy since 1966.
To do that they will surely have to perform better than at any point so far in Germany as they face an outstanding Spain team.
Spain will also have had an extra 24 hours to prepare for the final, having defeated France 2-1 on Tuesday.
The Netherlands had been hoping to repeat their triumph at the last Euros held in Germany, in 1988, but their current side lacks anyone with the star quality of Marco van Basten or Ruud Gullit.
A victory for them would have seen this Euros conclude with the same final as the 2010 World Cup. Instead they now go home.
England had got to this stage despite not winning any of their last four matches in 90 minutes, and having been taken to extra time by Slovakia and Switzerland.
That might have given the Dutch an edge physically, after the Oranje shrugged off finishing third in their group to brush aside Romania and then see off Turkey.
England welcomed back Marc Guehi in defence after suspension, while Netherlands coach Ronald Koeman opted to start Donyell Malen in attack in the ground where he plays club football for Borussia Dortmund.
The Westfalenstadion is a special place for the Dutch, as the scene of their 2-0 win over Brazil that took them through to the 1974 World Cup final.
They went ahead here after just seven minutes thanks to a stunning goal by Simons, who robbed Declan Rice 35 metres from goal and advanced before sending a rasping drive beyond Jordan Pickford.
The Dutch players ran off to celebrate with their fans behind that goal, as England found themselves behind for the third game running.
Just like against the Swiss in the quarter-finals, however, they reacted swiftly.
Kane forced a save from Bart Verbruggen and moments later sent a volley over the bar, and was caught by Denzel Dumfries on the follow-through.
It seemed totally innocuous but Zwayer was summoned across to review the images and gave a penalty.
Kane, whose missed spot-kick against France cost England dear in the 2022 World Cup, made no mistake, slotting low into the bottom-left corner.
It settled into an open and entertaining game, with Dumfries redeeming himself by clearing off the line from Phil Foden.
Dumfries crashed a header off the bar from a Simons corner, but Foden responded by curling a superb shot from range off the top of the post.
England's midfielders were being given too much time on the ball, and Koeman used an injury to Memphis Depay to reinforce the centre, replacing the forward with Joey Veerman.
Another change followed at the interval, with Wout Weghorst –- super-sub in previous rounds –- replacing Malen.
Yet the game became more cagey as the minutes went on and the fear of making a mistake grew.
Pickford denied Virgil van Dijk on 65 minutes and the Netherlands began to take control as England's leading players started to tire.
England did have the ball in the net on 79 minutes when Bukayo Saka turned in a Kyle Walker cutback, but the latter was just offside and the flag cut short the celebrations.
Southgate then decided to remove Kane and Foden, with Watkins and Palmer entering the fray to devastating effect.

https://www.citizen.digital/business/moodys-has-downgraded-kenyas-credit-rating-heres-what-that-means-for-the-country-n345600,"Moody's has downgraded Kenya's credit rating, here’s what that means for the country
Global rating agency Moody's recently
downgraded Kenya's credit rating, painting a bleak picture of the country's
economic status in terms of fulfilling debt obligations.
The country
moved from B3 rating, whereby the country's debt obligations are speculative
and subject to high credit risk, to Caa1 rating, whereby the obligations are
poor and subject to 'very high credit risk.'
Moody's
attributed the downgrade to Kenya's inability to effect fiscal consolidation
measures that would lower the risk of defaulting.
The agency also projected that the government
would not be able to introduce more revenue raising measures due to heightened
social tensions following the Gen Z protests that have rocked the country in
the past month.
In this piece,
Citizen Digital delves into the credit rating, how it's done, and its
implications on a country's projected outlook.
What
does Moody's do?
Moody's is a
New York based company that rates the creditworthiness of corporates and
governments. It uses Moody's Analytics, a software that provides data to enable
investors make sound decisions. It was founded in 1909 by John Moody, an
American financial analyst who also pioneered the rating of bonds.
How is the credit rating calculated?
When rating
countries, Moody's considers several factors such as industry trends,
regulatory environment, geopolitical factors, financial ratios, cash flow, debt
levels, market position and management quality.
Types
of Ratings
Moody's
ratings reflect the likelihood that a country may default and any financial
loss suffered in the event of a default.
The highest
rating is Aaa whereby a country's obligations are of minimal risk and of the
highest quality.
It drops
down to C whereby the country has already defaulted with little chances of
recovery.
Implications
for Kenya
A lower
grade for Kenya means that the global agency projects that Kenya is at a higher risk of defaulting on its debt obligations owing to financial uncertainty. The
rating also raises concerns over the country's ability to manage debt and
economic policies effectively.
To an
average Kenyan, a downgrade will affect them in the long term owing to
disruption of ease of doing business. A lower rating means that the borrowing
costs for both the government and private entities is projected to increase. In
turn, this means that interest rates on loans could hike leading to a tougher
economy for Kenyans grappling with the cost of living.
Investors
will also become wary of a lower rating and may opt to pour their funds in
other markets.
The
government's capacity to raise funds for developmental projects may be hindered
owing to the concern arising from the credit rating.
The credit
rating means that the government should opt for ways to maintain a fiscal
balance to create a conducive business environment.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/he-called-me-before-they-broke-into-his-house-opiyo-wandayi-narrates-how-gabriel-oguda-was-abducted-n344633,"‘He called me before they broke into his house’: Opiyo Wandayi narrates how Gabriel Oguda was 'abducted'
National Assembly
Minority Leader Opiyo Wandayi says popular social commentator Gabriel Oguda
called him early Tuesday morning before he was allegedly abducted from his
house.
Oguda, who works as a
political analyst at the minority leader’s office, is reported to have been taken
away from his home around 2 a.m. by men suspected to be policemen.
His arrest has been linked to his vocal stance online against the unpopular Finance Bill 2024 which has sparked nationwide protests, now in their second week.
During a House sitting on Tuesday midmorning, Wandayi said Oguda called him at 2:20 a.m. to say that there were people he suspected to be police officers trying to break into his compound.
“He said there were
cops at his gate trying to break into his compound. I tried to get lawyers to
handle the situation but 10 minutes later, my phone calls were jammed,” the
minority leader told the House.
“I was unable to make
or receive phone calls until 6:30 a.m. They broke into his compound, broke his
house’s door and abducted him. We do not know his whereabouts and don’t take it
lightly.”
Wandayi said they searched
for Oguda “in all police stations in Nairobi” but had not found him.
“We don’t know whether they
killed him or if they are holding him incommunicado somewhere,” he said.
Majority Leader Kimani
Ichungw’ah however told Wandayi to first contact the Inspector General of
Police before they conclude that Oguda was abducted or kidnapped, and establish
if the men who captured him were police officers.
“When this government took
over power in 2022, President William Ruto stated that the days of kidnappings,
abductions and extrajudicial killings are long gone. I assure Kenyans that it
shall never happen in this country again,” said Ichungw’ah.
He nonetheless maintained
that parliamentarians and parliamentary staff are not immune to the law, saying,
“If myself and Opiyo run into problems with the law, it will take its course;
we must be arrested and produced in court.”
Oguda is a vocal
critic of President William Ruto’s government and reports of his abduction were
shared alongside concerns that other people behind the X pages Franje, Drey
Mwangi and Osama Otero, were also captured overnight.
Another anti-Finance
Bill protester Shadrak Kiprono, alias Shad Khalif, was abducted on Saturday
night in Nairobi’s South B area and as of Tuesday morning, his whereabouts were
still unclear.
The Law Society of
Kenya (LSK) in a statement on Tuesday morning condemned the abductions as a
return to darkness.
LSK President Faith
Odhiambo vowed that the lawyers' body will bring those orchestrating the
abductions to book.
""Over the last 72
hours, Kenya has been drawn back to the dark era of a rogue, irrational police
force operating through repressive, retrogressive, clandestine, illegal,
extra-judicial tactics to forcefully quell public dissent against misgivings of
government, lapses in governance and more specifically, the contentious Finance
Bill 2024,"" Odhiambo said.
""We will unmask
and take action against these rogue criminal elements putting our police in
ruin.""
Two people have so far
died from police-inflicted injuries since the anti-Finance Bill demonstrations
began last Tuesday.
A nationwide strike
dubbed #TotalShutdownKE is on Tuesday scheduled to take place across all
counties, especially in Nairobi's central business district, to pressure
parliamentarians to shoot down the bill this week.
The proposed law
passed its Second Reading in the House last Tuesday after 204 MPs voted yes to
the bill while 115 voted no. It enters the Committee Stage this week.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/aisha-jumwa-urges-eac-to-embrace-kiswahili-for-regional-unity-n345329,"Aisha Jumwa urges EAC to embrace Kiswahili for regional unity
Delivering the keynote address during the official opening session of the 2nd East African Kiswahili Commission (EAKC) International Conference in Mombasa, Kenya, Cabinet Secretary in charge of Gender, Culture, the Arts and Heritage, Aisha Jumwa, urged East Africans to be proactive in developing Kiswahili and other African languages to enhance their global competitiveness.
“Kiswahili is spoken by over 200 million people worldwide. This demonstrates that our efforts to promote the language are yielding results and we should continue to advance these efforts,” she stated.
Jumwa disclosed that Kenya is considering establishing a National Kiswahili-Speaking Day as part of efforts to promote the language at national level.
“In Kenya, we are discussing the possibility of designating a special day, possibly the 7th of July, when every Kenyan, including the President, judges, civil servants, and teachers, will be expected to speak exclusively in Kiswahili,"" she said.
Jumwa further revealed that Kenya was in the final stages of establishing the National Swahili Council to develop specific strategies, methods and policies needed to promote and develop Kiswahili in the country, in addition to collaborating with national and private actors involved in the development of the Kiswahili language.
The two-day conference precedes the 3rd EAC World Kiswahili Language Day set for Sunday, 7th July. The three-day celebrations are aimed at exploring the role of Kiswahili and multilingual education in fostering a culture of peace.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/gaza-airstrike-hit-as-displaced-gathered-for-soccer-match-witnesses-say-n345621,"Gaza airstrike hit as displaced gathered for soccer match, witnesses say
An Israeli missile slammed into a tent encampment in southern Gaza on Tuesday just as displaced people had gathered there to watch a football match at a school, eyewitnesses said on Wednesday.
At least 29 people, mostly women and children, were killed in the strike, according to Palestinian officials, which took place as spectators crowded the school grounds in Abassan east of Khan Younis and hawkers sold smoothies and biscuits.
""They were watching a football match. There were injuries and martyrs. I witnessed this...people thrown around and body parts scattered, blood,"" a young woman, Ghazzal Nasser, told Reuters in Abassan.
""Everything was normal. People were playing, others were buying and selling (food and drinks). There was no sound of planes or anything,"" she said.
The Israeli military said it was reviewing reports that civilians were harmed. It said the incident occurred when it struck with a ""precise munition"" a Hamas fighter who took part in the Oct. 7 raid on Israel that triggered the war.
The military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether it knew that a football match was going on when the strike was ordered.
At the nearby Nasser Hospital, dozens of Palestinians bid farewell to loved ones before funerals and burials.
""The schools were overcrowded with people and the street was full too, suddenly a missile hit and destroyed the whole place,"" said Asmaa Qudeih, who lost some relatives in the attack.
""Bodies flew in the wind, body parts flew, I don't know how to describe it,"" she said.
Israeli forces continued to press their offensive in north and central Gaza on Wednesday, and deepened their incursion into two Gaza City districts, carrying out house-to-house searches.
The militant group Hamas said the renewed Israeli campaign threatened to derail efforts to secure a ceasefire in the nine-month-old war, with talks to resume in Doha on Wednesday.
In Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told U.S. Middle East envoy Brett McGurk he was committed to securing a Gaza ceasefire deal provided Israel's red lines were respected, his office said.
Hamas has accepted a key part of a U.S. plan aimed at ending the nine-month-old war, dropping a demand that Israel first commit to a permanent ceasefire before signing the agreement.
Netanyahu has insisted the deal must not prevent Israel from resuming fighting until its war objectives are met. At the outset of the war, he pledged to annihilate Hamas.
Leaflets were dropped on Gaza City on Wednesday, this time with a map marking ""safe routes"" for the evacuation of the whole city, not just certain districts. The Israeli leaflets urge civilians to head south to the central Gaza Strip.
The city, home to more than a quarter of Gaza's population before the war, was destroyed by an Israeli assault in the first weeks of fighting last year, but hundreds of thousands of Gazans are believed to have returned to the ruins in recent months.
Israeli forces patrolled the main road to the coast, snipers commandeered rooftops of some high-rise buildings still standing, and tanks were stationed inside the headquarters of the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA, residents said.
The Israeli military said in a statement its forces were continuing operations in Gaza City against militants of Hamas and its ally Islamic Jihad, who they said had operated from inside the UNRWA facilities, using them as a base for attacks.
The Palestinian Red Crescent said it had received dozens of desperate calls from residents in Gaza City trapped in their homes but teams were unable to reach them because of the intensity of the bombing.
""The information coming from Gaza City shows residents are living through tragic conditions. (Israeli) occupation forces continue to hit residential districts, and displace people from their homes and refuge shelters,"" it said in a statement.
The armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad said fighters fought with Israeli forces operating in the area with anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs, and sometimes in close-range combat.
The Israeli military announced that one of its soldiers was killed in fighting on Tuesday in central Gaza. It has published the names of 681 military personnel killed in the Oct. 7 attacks and subsequent fighting.
Israel's Defence Minister, Yoav Gallant, said on Wednesday that 60% of the fighters of Hamas had been killed or wounded as a result of the military offensive in Gaza.
In the central Gaza camp of Al-Nuseirat, medics said six Palestinians, including children, were killed in an airstrike on a house, while another airstrike killed two people and wounded several others in Khan Younis.
More than 38,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war, health officials in the Hamas-run territory said.
The war erupted when militants led by Hamas infiltrated southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli figures.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/expert-gachagua-exposes-ruto-as-relying-on-unfounded-rumors-n344798,"Expert: Gachagua exposes Ruto as relying on unfounded rumors
Leaders and politicians have expressed their views on Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua’s recent criticism of National Intelligence Service (NIS) Director Noordin Haji for allegedly failing to provide proper insights on key issues affecting the country.
Speaking from Mombasa on Wednesday, Gachagua lamented that since Haji succeeded Major General (Rtd) Philip Wachira Kameru in June 2023, the NIS has become dysfunctional, failing to adequately assess public sentiment, particularly concerning the now-withdrawn Finance Bill 2024.
""I sympathize with President Ruto because this information (the possibility of the youths demonstrating against the Finance Bill) was not available to him. NIS is mandated to provide such information, and that is where the problem is; we have a dysfunctional NIS that has exposed the President, the government, and the people of Kenya,"" said Gachagua.
Reacting to Gachagua’s statement, security expert Eric Okeyo claimed that the Deputy President’s remarks confirmed the country’s fears that the government is “dysfunctional.”
According to Okeyo, Gachagua’s statement highlighted that the NIS is currently a demotivated team unable to execute its mandate effectively.
""The statement by Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua yesterday only confirmed our fears that the two-year-old regime was already dysfunctional, in tatters, and a pale shadow of its original dream,"" Okeyo said.
On the implications of Gachagua’s statement for President Ruto, Kokeyo stated that the Deputy President has exposed his boss as a man relying on rumours to execute his agenda.
""When Gachagua openly admits that the loss of lives and destruction of property was caused by security negligence within the government, he has exposed his boss as naked and relying on unfounded rumours in the management of dissenting voices,"" he asserted.
Gachagua also received heavy criticism from former Mombasa Governor Ali Hassan Joho, who described the Deputy President’s statements as reckless and untimely.
According to Joho, Gachagua’s comments show division within the government at a time when leadership should demonstrate unity in addressing the crisis caused by the contentious Finance Bill 2024.
“I find it disturbing that a leader of his stature would issue such reckless statements at a time when the government needs to be seen as pulling in one direction. As a country, we find ourselves in unfamiliar territory, and it's incumbent upon the leadership to restore confidence in its citizens rather than apportioning blame for failures that should be collectively owned,” Joho said.
The former governor also accused Gachagua of promoting tribalism by criticizing Haji’s leadership at the helm of the country’s intelligence agency.
""To make it worse, the sentiments by Mr. Rigathi Gachagua smack of tribal undertones, and that’s the least this country needs at this time,"" he said.

https://www.citizen.digital/opinion-blogs/opinion-unlocking-africas-insurance-potential-the-power-of-digital-innovation-and-collaborative-partnerships-n345122,"OPINION: Unlocking Africa's insurance potential - The power of digital innovation and collaborative partnerships
Despite the stagnant penetration rate of below three per cent, the insurance landscape in Africa holds promise, brimming with opportunities and potential.
Given Africa's high mobile penetration, especially with smartphones becoming more affordable, insurance services are increasingly available via digital channels, to the advantage of the increasing tech-savvy generation that spends more time on their phones, tablets, or computers.
In Kenya, for instance, there were 33.6 million smartphones as of December 2023, according to Communication Authority (CAK) statistics. This means that at least 67 percent of the population is using smartphones. Both internet and smartphone penetration have created a ready market for insurance services.
Trends Fueling Insurance Uptake in Africa
Another trend contributing to the increased uptake of insurance in Kenya and the rest of Africa is the growing number of partnerships between insurers and tech companies.
This trend – exemplified by collaborations such as mTek and other market partners, especially in fintech, asset financing, transport and logistics, and health services, among others – involves the embedding of insurance products directly into the purchasing process. For instance, insuring a car or a phone at the point of sale directly through an e-commerce or financing platform.
Insurance companies themselves are rapidly digitising, aiming to become more efficient, better service their customers, and offer more tailored products and services.
There is also an increase geared towards microinsurance products, which are affordable and have low premium costs, making them suitable for a broader segment of the population, particularly farmers and lower-income demographics who never had access to tailor-made and affordable insurance products.
These products often cover areas like health, agriculture, and personal property, and working with partners to understand the end consumer requirements and needs is critical.
Power of Data
Insurance companies are increasingly harnessing the power of data to transform how insurance products are developed and tailored to the market. As a data processor and intermediary, mTek collects and analyzes vast amounts of market data through its platform, integrating seamlessly with mobile technology and digital interfaces.
This includes tracking user behaviour, such as how customers interact with insurance offerings, the frequency of their engagements, and their response to different insurance models.
By understanding these behavioural patterns alongside traditional data points—such as mobile app usage, customer inquiries, and transaction histories—mTek gains deep insights into which insurance products are most needed and where.
This user-centric data approach allows them to not only tailor their offerings to meet specific customer demands but also to innovate in underserved areas, creating products that are both accessible and relevant.
Consequently, mTek’s role as a data intermediary significantly enhances its ability to design insurance solutions that are precisely aligned with consumer needs, behaviors, and market gaps, thereby promoting greater insurance penetration and financial inclusion across the region.
Collaborations
In addition to directly serving individuals and businesses, mTek also collaborates closely with a network of strategic partners across various industries. Through innovative API integrations, white-labelled web solutions, and other types of seamless integrations, they empower their partners to offer insurance products to their own customer base.
These partnerships enable both insurance and other non-insurance enterprises to enhance the value they provide to their customers by seamlessly integrating insurance offerings into their existing products and services.
Their flexible integration options allow partners to leverage the brand and trust they have already built with their customers and effortlessly incorporate insurance solutions into their offerings, thereby enriching the overall value proposition.
Additionally, through strategic partnerships with a variety of partners playing in different industries, mTek is able to tap into customer data that reveals detailed insights into consumer behavior and preferences.
By collaborating with fintechs, e-commerce platforms, and other tech-driven businesses, they leverage their data to tailor insurance products that fit seamlessly into the lives of their customers. This collaboration not only improves the relevance of their offerings but also enhances the customer experience, making insurance feel like a natural part of their everyday transactions.
By integrating their insurance products into these platforms, they help extend financial safety nets to a broader audience, ensuring that more individuals and businesses can access protective coverage with ease and convenience.
These approaches not only reduce customer acquisition costs but also promote long-term engagement by embedding products in platforms that customers already trust and use daily.
By doing so, they ensure the continuous innovation and viability of their insurance offerings, which is essential for the ongoing evolution of the insurance sector in Africa.
In collaboration with their partners, they are continuously exploring new ways to develop and enhance insurance products that meet the evolving needs of their customers.
From customizable policies to on-demand coverage, they strive to deliver innovative solutions that empower their clients to safeguard their assets and livelihoods effectively.
Technological Advancement
The technological advancements play a crucial role in facilitating embedded insurance and ecosystem partnerships.
Leveraging analytics and machine learning to derive actionable insights from the data collected. This will enable us to better understand customer behaviour, assess risk more accurately, and personalize insurance offerings to meet the specific needs of individual clients.
Using data-driven predictive modelling techniques, mTek aims to anticipate future trends and identify emerging risks, enabling us to proactively adjust our insurance products and services to meet the evolving needs of our customers.
By harnessing the power of data analytics and machine learning, we can not only better understand customer behavior but also tailor personalized and contextualized product offerings to deliver the right insurance solutions precisely when and where the customer needs them.
This approach ensures that our customers receive the most relevant and timely insurance coverage, enhancing their overall experience and satisfaction while driving greater value for all stakeholders involved.
Artificial Intelligence and Chatbots, despite being buzzwords, they work - and we’re already offering insurance purchases over chatbots. These chatbots, soon to be fully powered by large language models, are capable of understanding and responding to customer queries in real-time, offering support and guidance throughout the insurance buying process or during claims handling.
This technology not only streamlines customer service operations but also provides a personalized experience to users by adapting responses according to the context of the interaction. By leveraging these advanced AI tools, mTek ensures that customers receive timely and relevant information, which enhances satisfaction and builds lasting relationships and trust.
By harnessing the power of data, mTek aims to catalyze a transformational shift in the insurance ecosystem, driving greater efficiency, transparency, and value for all stakeholders involved. From more accurate pricing models to enhanced fraud detection mechanisms, the potential applications of data-driven insights are virtually limitless.
Navigating Regulatory Hurdles
Stakeholders can collaborate to overcome regulatory hurdles and promote innovation in the African insurance ecosystem by working together to establish regulatory sandboxes or workgroups that allow startups and established companies to test innovative products and services in a controlled environment with real consumers, without the immediate burden of full regulatory compliance.
These work groups can focus on identifying key regulatory challenges, proposing solutions, and advising on policy development that supports innovation while ensuring consumer protection. This approach provides valuable data and insights that can help shape future regulations and foster innovation. It also allows regulators to understand new technologies and business models in a practical setting.
Additionally, considering the diverse regulatory landscapes across African countries, stakeholders can collaborate on standardizing regulations to create a more unified market. This would reduce barriers to entry for new entrants such as mTek and allow successful innovations to scale across borders more effectively.
Regional economic communities like the East African Community (EAC) could and should play a pivotal role in driving these initiatives. Partnerships with NGOs and the parastatals can be instrumental in tackling large-scale projects such as national insurance databases, digital identity systems, or inclusive insurance programs targeted at underserved communities.
Another aspect is leveraging technology and data for regulatory compliance - mainly around improving transparency in transactions, reducing fraud, and enhancing data security.
AI and machine learning can help in monitoring and compliance tasks by analyzing data to detect patterns that may indicate non-compliance or potential risks. Data can also assist all stakeholders who can then collaborate on establishing guidelines and technologies that facilitate safe and efficient data exchanges. This can enhance the ability of insurers to offer products that are better tailored to the needs of diverse populations.
The author, Bente Krogmann, is the CEO at mTek.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/how-i-robbed-ksh800k-from-nairobi-supermarket-and-later-escaped-mob-justice-n344865,"How I robbed Ksh.800K from Nairobi supermarket and later escaped mob justice
A struggle ensued between Muendo and the cashier, leading him to fire a shot into the air. The startled gunman swiftly vanished into the crowd, escaping to safety.
""I was scared for my life, but I felt like I had no other choice. My child was sick, and I didn't have the 100,000 shillings needed for the required surgery,"" he explained.
Muendo admitted this wasn't his first robbery attempt. He mentioned that although he had reduced his criminal activities and tried doing business, it wasn't successful.
""I had quit robbery, but not entirely. I would only resort to stealing when things got worse. My child's condition forced me back into the criminal world,"" he confessed.
Leaving his child at the hospital, Muendo embarked on a mission to steal, hoping to survive and provide for his child. He carefully surveyed supermarkets in the CBD and chose the busiest one to maximize his gains. The theft lasted about ten minutes, and upon returning home, he had collected an additional Ksh.800,000.
""I knew I would have more than enough. I fired into the air to cause confusion, quickly changed my clothes, blended into the crowd, and disappeared. I got home safely, but later realized I was on the news while counting the money,"" he recounted.
The next day, he used the stolen money to discharge his child from the hospital. Unfortunately, a friend who knew about the heist stole the remaining balance from him, leaving him with nothing.
""I went to meet former Governor Mike Sonko in town for assistance, but instead, I was arrested and taken to Central Police Station. They lacked evidence against me since I had destroyed the clothes, and my friend had vanished with the gun and the money,"" he elaborated.
Muendo noted that many of his friends had succumbed to crime, recalling an incident where a mob almost killed him after a failed robbery attempt.
""You can't evade justice forever; it catches up with you eventually. I used to live in fear even before the robbery, but somehow I escaped unscathed. In 2016, I was arrested, sentenced, and later acquitted, which was a turning point for me,"" he reflected.
Due to his incarceration, his partner took their child and ceased communication, which deeply affected him.
""I returned to stealing to fund my drinking habit. After a second attempt, I was arrested again and spent a year in Kamiti. Life in Kamiti was different; it kept me away from drugs and turned me around. Today, I advocate against crime, especially in informal settlements,"" he concluded.

Novak Djokovic is poised to mount a one-man battle to preserve the legacy of Wimbledon's golden generation in the face of an increasingly successful new wave spearheaded by Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner.
However, the odds will be stacked against the seven-time champion and the holder of 24 Grand Slam titles when the tournament gets underway on Monday.
Arriving in London having recently undergone knee surgery, the 37-year-old Serb, runner-up to Alcaraz last year, has seen his Grand Slam powers eroded in 2024.
He was succeeded as Australian Open champion by Sinner with the Italian also taking his world number one ranking.
Djokovic then saw his French Open crown pass to Alcaraz after he limped out of Paris suffering from a torn meniscus in his right knee.
If Djokovic equals Roger Federer's record of eight Wimbledon titles, he would become the oldest champion of the modern era.
""I have this incredible desire to play, just to compete,"" said Djokovic who will take on 123rd-ranked Vit Kopriva of the Czech Republic in his opener on Tuesday.
""Just the thought of missing Wimbledon was not correct.""
With Federer now retired, Rafael Nadal skipping the tournament to focus on the Paris Olympics and Andy Murray playing in the aftermath of a back operation, there is definitely change in the air in south-west London.
Germany's world number four Alexander Zverev on Saturday predicted this year's Wimbledon will be the ""most open in 20 years"".
The likelihood is that for the first time since 2002, the men's final on July 14 will not feature at least one of the 'Big Four' who have swept up 19 of the last 20 titles.
Alcaraz, at 21 and 16 years Djokovic's junior, is already a three-time major winner.
He captured the US Open in 2022 while still a teenager, defeated Djokovic in a five-set final at Wimbledon in 2023 before seeing off Zverev in another five setter at the French Open this month.
Alcaraz, who opens Centre Court action on Monday against 262nd-ranked Mark Lajal of Estonia, has a chance to complete a rare French Open-Wimbledon double in the same season.
""I know that it's going to be a really difficult and big challenge for me, but I think I'm ready to do it,"" said the Spaniard.
Sinner, 22, made the semi-finals at Wimbledon last year and celebrated his first grass-court title at Halle this month.
The top-seeded Italian has racked up four titles in 2024, losing just three of 41 matches. He faces Germany's Yannick Hanfmann in his Monday opener.
Wimbledon will also bid an emotional farewell to two-time champion Murray.
The 37-year-old British star, who famously ended Britain's 77-year wait for a Wimbledon men's champion with his 2013 victory, plans to bow out at the Olympics.
He is due to face 38th-ranked Tomas Machac of the Czech Republic on Tuesday but whether or not he makes it on court is still in doubt.
Now ranked at 115 in the world, Murray has undergone surgery to remove a cyst on his spine.
Already playing with a metal hip, the former world number one damaged ankle ligaments against Machac in Miami in April in another brutal indication of the physical setbacks endured by the sport's marquee names.
""It's complicated, and it's made more complicated because I want to play at Wimbledon one more time,"" said Murray before the draw was made.
""I would say it's probably more likely that I'm not able to play singles right now.""
He is, however, set to play doubles alongside brother Jamie.
In the women's event, world number one Iga Swiatek, fresh from a fourth French Open title and fifth Grand Slam title, arrives on a 19-match win streak.
The 23-year-old Pole's best run at Wimbledon was a quarter-final spot in 2023.
Swiatek faces 2020 Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin in the first round.
US Open champion and world number two Coco Gauff, made her breakthrough at Wimbledon as a 15-year-old qualifier in 2019 when she made the last 16.
She also pushed through to the fourth round in 2021 but has a point to prove after a first round exit to American compatriot Kenin in 2023.
Gauff starts against compatriot Caroline Dolehide, ranked 52.
Third-ranked Aryna Sabalenka, the Australian Open champion and a semi-finalist at Wimbledon in 2021 and 2023, said she is still not ""100% certain"" of playing.
The Belarusian is due to face 106th-ranked Emina Bektas of the United States on Monday but a shoulder injury which forced her retirement at the Berlin grass-court tournament last week has not healed.
When asked if she will withdraw from the tournament, she said: ""There's always a chance"".
Marketa Vondrousova became the first unseeded player to win the women's title 12 months ago but history is not on her side if she is optimistic of a repeat.
Serena Williams, in 2016, was the last woman to successfully defend the title.

NCIC said it is investigating utterances made by the MP in Somali language, where he said he would 'slaughter 5000 Gen Z protesters' if he were president of Kenya.
""The utterances are likely to incite feelings of contempt, hatred, hostility, violence or discrimination, and affect harmonious coexistence between groups of different political affiliations in Kenya, contrary to Section 13 (1) (a) of the NCI Act,"" NCIC said.
""Hon. Farah Maalim is required to appear before the Commission to assist with the aforementioned ongoing investigations. Failure to appear in person at the said place, date, and time, is an offense as provided under Section 63 (c) as read with Section 63 (e) of the NCI Act,"" the Commission further stated.
The summons come after Kenyans demanded the arrest and prosecution of Maalim after a video of him making the inflammatory remarks against the young Kenyan protesters surfaced.
In the undated video which has since gone viral, Maalim, while speaking in the Somali dialect, said that if he were the President of Kenya he would have slaughtered 5,000 young protesters daily.
A verified video translation reveals that the legislator was censuring Kenyan Gen Zs for their attempt to march to State House during the anti-finance Bill 2024 protests.
""This was an attempted coup, a clear attempted coup. Children of wealthy business owners, wealthy parents and kids raised on ill-gotten wealth, 80% from one tribe were dropped off in downtown and told to riot and take over State House and Parliament buildings,"" he said.
""God forbid if I was president I would have slaughtered them, 5,000 of them daily. Serious, there is no two ways about it,"" he said.
Maalim has defended himself saying the video was edited to paint him in a bad picture.
""It's all editing, cutting and pasting, taking a word from here, another one from here and putting it together. There is a lot of nonsense there. It's Somalis basically who would do that because I weighed in on their politics. It's not the true picture,"" he said.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/northern-kenya-counties-prioritize-climate-smart-agriculture-to-enhance-food-security-n345018,"Northern Kenya counties prioritize Climate-Smart Agriculture to enhance food security
This call was amplified during the Lamu, Tana River, Garissa, Wajir and Mandera County Investment conference.
The conference which was organized by USAID Kuza and themed Unveiling Opportunities: redefining Northern Kenya as an Investable Destination brought together investors, local entrepreneurs, government officials, and development partners who discussed ways to create opportunities and build sustainable economic growth in the region.
The region offers investors a diverse range of potential ventures including investments in efficient water-irrigation systems to optimize water usage, research on resilient seed varieties to ensure consistent crop yields, modern fodder production techniques, training programs for farmers on climate-smart practices, and value-added processing facilities to reduce post-harvest losses and improve market access for agricultural products.
Speaking during the conference, the Cabinet Secretary for Investments, Trade and Industry, Rebecca Miano reiterated the support that the ministry has provided to the agriculture and livestock sector in the country through individual farmers and micro, small and medium enterprises.
""Clearly, northern Kenya is open for business. As a ministry, we are continuously seeking partnerships with domestic and international investors to spur the northern region's economic transformation.""
""We recently concluded discussions on the Kenya-United Arab Emirates Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement that opens preferential export markets within the gulf region and the meat value chain will be largely benefited,"" remarked the CS Miano.
In the past, the northern region of Kenya has faced the burden of climate disasters including floods, droughts, and unpredictable weather patterns. These events have disrupted livelihoods, particularly among pastoralists and farmers, threatened food security, and worsened existing vulnerabilities.
Northern Kenya boasts large areas of fertile land, a growing workforce, and a rising demand for sustainable agricultural solutions. By partnering with these countries, investors have the opportunity to contribute to a thriving regional economy while making a positive environmental impact.
Other key discussions on climate response revolved around identifying and prioritizing measures to mitigate the impacts of climate-related disasters such as torrential rains which lead to poor road conditions, destruction of farmland, and spread of water-borne diseases. The discussion also shed light on hazard preparedness through early warning systems and community-based disaster risk reduction.
Also notable was the conversation on waste management. Panelists emphasized the importance of proper waste disposal, particularly for coastal areas. This will not only protect marine life from plastic pollution but also reduce the risk of plastic poisoning in seafood consumed by local communities and potentially exported.
Other conversations addressed peace-building efforts in order to foster an enabling environment for investment with a focus on managing disaster risks and enhancing trade relations among the counties. Further to that, attendees explored innovative financing models for infrastructure projects through PPPs, improving livestock productivity and promotion of youth participation in agricultural development.
USAID Kuza plans to host a joint conference targeting all the Frontier Counties (otherwise known as FCDC Counties) later this year in October 2024.

Speaking on Friday, residents of Kirinyaga central have called for heightened security measures after the latest incident in which a cow was stolen and slaughtered at Kirutira village.
According to Juliana Wanjiku Muriuki, her cow was stolen on Thursday at Kirutira in Kerugoya ward.
She said witnesses saw a Probox, which was ferrying the stolen cow remove the animal and slaughter it before leaving the site with remains of the carcass left behind.
Jamlick Chomba, a neighbour, said the thieves drove off at high speed before villagers could corner them.
""We were able to see the number plate of the vehicle and we will forward it to the police,"" he said.
Josphat Karimi, the victim's son, said several people in the area have been victims of theft and villagers are now calling on the security agencies to increase patrols and hunt down the thieves.
Other cases of theft include one in Ndia constituency at Kahuhi ini village, where two cows belonging to Michael Maina were stolen and slaughtered two kilometers away from his homestead.
""The two cows worth over Ksh. 200,000 were my source of income. I was using the earnings to pay school fees for my children,"" he lamented.
The farmer said that following the theft, only the cows' skin was left on the side of the road.

In an interview with Standard, Sifuna said Raila has people he leads, and those are the people he is going to represent during the national dialogue announced by Ruto on Tuesday.
""Raila is not going to represent Gen Z. Gen Z have said they are leaderless and Raila is not their leader. But there are people Baba (Raila) leads. Not everyone is leaderless and partyless. I have a party and I am the Secretary General of that party (ODM),"" Sifuna said.
He added that those who are in the party are the people Raila is going to represent during the dialogue.
""We can't sit as leaders and keep quiet as things happen in the country. Gen Z did their Space (X Spaces) with the president, did you see Sifuna or Raila there? No. So Raila is a leader to some people and those are the people he is going to represent, not everyone is leaderless,"" Sifuna added.
Raila faced criticism on Tuesday when together with Ruto they agreed on a 6-day national dialogue to discuss pressing national matters, among them the recent concerns raised by Gen Z about Ruto's governance.
Kenyans took to social media to slam him for what many said was a betrayal to the clamour for change and better leadership, with some reminding him that he does not speak for nor represent them.
Kenyans who have lately been angered by Ruto's administration expected the opposition leader to be on their side, even as he seeks the government's support for the AU Commission chairmanship.
Ruto's government faced deadly protests, especially after parliament voted in favour of the unpopular Finance Bill 2024, which sought to impose more taxes on Kenyans.
The protests forced Ruto into dropping the bill and promise austerity measures to reduce government spending.
MPs and government officials have also faced criticism from Kenyans for supporting punitive policies and openly displaying opulence while many live below the poverty line.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/shakahola-massacre-pastor-mackenzie-goes-on-trial-on-terrorism-charges-n345454,"Shakahola massacre: Pastor Mackenzie goes on trial on terrorism charges
Published on: July 08, 2024 06:45 (EAT)

The leader of a Kenyan doomsday cult went on trial on Monday on charges of terrorism over the deaths of more than 400 of his followers in a macabre case that shocked the world.
Self-proclaimed pastor Paul Nthenge Mackenzie appeared in a packed courtroom in the Indian Ocean port city of Mombasa along with 94 co-defendants.
Principle magistrate Leah Juma ordered the removal of journalists from the court shortly after the start of the hearing to enable a protected witness to take the stand on camera.
Mackenzie, who was arrested in April last year, is alleged to have incited his acolytes to starve to death in order to ""meet Jesus"" in one of the world's worst cult-related massacres.
The father of seven and his co-accused pleaded not guilty to the charges of terrorism at a hearing in January.
The 55 men and 40 women also face charges of murder, manslaughter, as well as child torture and cruelty in separate cases.
The remains of more than 440 people have been unearthed so far in a remote wilderness inland from the Indian Ocean coastal town of Malindi, in a case that has been dubbed the ""Shakahola forest massacre"".
Autopsies have found that while starvation appeared to be the main cause of death, some of the victims -- including children -- were strangled, beaten, or suffocated.
Previous court documents also said that some of the bodies had had their organs removed.
- 'Well-organised criminal enterprise' -
Prosecutors said in a statement that they planned to call about 90 witnesses to testify as well as physical and digital evidence.
""The prosecution will present evidence to illustrate that the accused did not function merely as a fringe group, but rather as a well-organised criminal enterprise operating under the guise of a church under the leadership of (Mackenzie),"" the statement said.
Mackenzie, a former taxi driver, turned himself in after police first entered Shakahola forest in April last year and found the bodies of four people and several other starving people.
The police action came after a relative of one of the victims received a tip-off from a former member of Mackenzie's Good News International Church about grisly happenings in Shakahola forest.
Mackenzie had set up the church in 2003, but closed it in 2019 and moved to the sleepy town of Shakahola to prepare for what he had predicted would be the end of the world in August last year.
In March this year, the authorities began releasing some victims' bodies to distraught relatives after months of painstaking work to identify them using DNA.
Questions have been raised about how Mackenzie, a self-styled pastor with a history of extremism, managed to evade law enforcement despite his prominent profile and previous legal cases.
Interior Minister Kithure Kindiki last year accused Kenyan police of laxity in investigating the initial reports of starvation.
""The Shakahola massacre is the worst breach of security in the history of our country,"" he told a senate committee hearing, vowing to ""relentlessly push for legal reforms to tame rogue preachers"".
Reports by the Kenyan senate and a state-funded human rights watchdog have said the authorities could have prevented the deaths.
The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR) in March criticised security officers in Malindi for ""gross abdication of duty and negligence"".
The horrific saga has seen President William Ruto vow to intervene in Kenya's homegrown religious movements.
In largely Christian Kenya, it has also thrown a spotlight on failed efforts to regulate unscrupulous churches and cults that have dabbled in criminality.

Melvin Mweresa opened Vihiga's account in the early minutes of the game with an unconverted try before Felix Awoka added yet another unconverted try to take Vihiga 10-0 up at the breather.
Upon the resumption of the second half, Vihiga kept putting more pressure on Senende's yard, a result that saw Hurdson Makokha breaking through Senende's defense to touch a center post try, Apwoka added the conversion to stretch Vihiga's lead to 17-00. Youngster Felix Apwoka grabbed a late-minute try to seal Vihiga's win with a 22-00 score at full-time.
Speaking to Citizen Digital after the win, Vihiga head coach Abdi Abdalla credited experience for his charge's win.
""It was a tough match, the semi-finals we were a bit shaky but we won, going to the finals my boys banked on the experience, and it paid off against Senende, am proud of the win and we look forward to Regional games,"" he offered.
Vihiga has now bagged the county title a record six consecutive times since 2019. Vihiga had earlier on beat Nyang'ori 28-14 in the semi-final to book their place in the finals while Senende defeated former East Africa Champions Chavakali High School who finished third 12-07, Levin Phergisin scored a brace for Senende while Xavier Imbabi scored Chavakalis lone try.
Melvin Mweresa from Vihiga High was named the top try scorer of the tournament with seven tries.
The girls' category saw Madira claim the championship, triumphing over Kisangula Girls with a 26-0 win. A brace from Diana Joy and a try each from Whitney Omari and Naomi Andeyo were enough to secure the championship for Madira.

The school that was established by the community in 2016 has been closed for more than a year, with students left in limbo.
Martin Ngeyo, a resident, said, “This is a community school and we don’t understand how someone can come and claim ownership of this property yet it belongs to the community.”
He continued, “The school started as a simple mabati structure, then community members came together to upgrade the facility, but thereafter, we were shocked to find elements cordoning off part of the land on which the school sits and claiming ownership.”
Locals claim officials in the area, including the chief, said the land was now owned by someone else to their astonishment.
Ngeyo said, “Our children have been left to suffer without a school and we demand action be taken against those trying to grab land.”
Joseph Chebunde, a member of the Council of Elders, said, “The authorities keep saying that our youths should not engage in crime, however, they themselves are enabling it by allowing land to be grabbed.”
He continued, “Those engaged in the practice should be brought to book.”
Another local, Phylis Ndege, said, “We had enrolled our children at the school because it was close by. Now many have to look for schools that are many kilometres away.”
Area Deputy Commissioner Langa Manjama said that the matter is being investigated.

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/gor-a-stepping-stone-to-europe-says-recruit-odhiambo-n345510,"Gor a stepping stone to Europe, says recruit Odhiambo
Two months after
joining the reigning Kenyan Premier League champions, new signing Levin
Odhiambo says playing for Gor Mahia in the coming seasons will help him attract
suitors from elite clubs in Europe.
Odhiambo, 21, was invited for trials by Swedish side Vasteras IF, but the odds
did not favor him despite impressing the coach.
""I had a week and a half to showcase my talent in Sweden with Vasteras IF.”
Unfortunately, one of
their dependable center-backs got injured, and since they wanted to sign just one
player in that transfer window, they decided to replace the defender, and that
is how I ended up not joining them,"" he explained.
He says he left Vasteras for Vasalunds FK to visit a Kenyan friend, he got an
opportunity to train the topflight champions and eventually sealed a
season-long deal.
""When the plan flopped, and my stay in Sweden was not over yet, I decided
to visit Frank Odhiambo, who was plying his trade with Vasalunds. I was offered
a chance to train with them, but they did not sign up.
“I feel I ambushed
them when they were not ready to sign,"" he added.
While defending his club's decision to allow the defender to join rivals Gor
Mahia, Tusker head coach Robert Matano said the player would have eventually
departed from the Ruaraka-based side due to a lack of playing time, which led
to an emotional disconnect with the club.
However, according to
the former Kayole Youth player, some of his friends and family members told him
to pursue a transfer to Gor Mahia upon receiving news that he had joined Tusker
FC.
""When it was
official that I had joined Tusker FC, I received calls and texts from friends
and family members asking me to sign for Gor Mahia if my dream of going abroad
is still unchanged.'
""My mum believes
only Gor Mahia can be the conveyor belt to Europe, and when she heard I have
joined the Green Army, she got impressed,"" he added.
Odhiambo joined the Brewers last season from Mathare United after the latter was
relegated from the top flight following a dismal campaign.
In the 25th Premier
League matches that Matano-led charges played last season, Odhiambo featured
only twice, scoring two goals in the process.
Odhiambo is expected to compete with in-form Geoffrey Onyango for the starting
berth, saying only hard work on and off the pitch will land him into the
starting XI.
""I was signed by immediate former coach, Jonathan McKinstry, and with the
new coach having taken over, I am sure I will impress him, and I am ready to
perform whether I am deployed as a left-back or wing-back,"" he expressed.
Though he is impressed by joining the twenty-one-time Kenyan champions, he says
he is aware of the challenge awaiting him and his colleague once the new season
starts rolling.
""Here (at Gor), fans push the players from game one to the last match, and
this means the team has to perform.
“I have always wanted
to be in such an atmosphere, and finally, here I am. I'm thrilled,"" stated
the smiley Odhiambo.
Previously, Odhiambo was
featured for Muhoroni, Wazito, and Naivas FC.

Twenty-four Kenyans had as of Sunday night been
confirmed dead from police brutality in the recent nationwide protests, Amnesty
International has said.
In a statement on Monday, the human rights
group said the youngest casualty is a twelve-year-old identified as Kennedy
Onyango.
Further, 361 people have been injured, 627 arrested
and 32 abductions made from the onset of the anti-Finance Bill 2024 and anti-government
demonstrations on June 18.
""Abduction and detention differ from
an arrest Many of those abducted by state officers were not read the charges
against them or booked into a police station. Tens have been held incommunicado
and denied access to their families, legal representation and medical
assistance,"" Amnesty said.
The organisation condemned the use of
excessive police force against emergency response teams and journalists.
“Medical personnel have come under fire,
arrested by state officers and had their patient lists stolen from mobile
emergency centres serving the injured. Lawyers have been denied access to their
clients, arrested, and intimidated by officers of the state to drop
cases,"" Amnesty said.
""Journalists covering the protests
have had their cameras confiscated, arrested and beaten in broad daylight.
Staff operating helplines and funds set up to support legal representation and
medical assistance have faced several experiences.""
They further demanded that the government
should heed the demands made by the Kenyan youth including the release of those
held incommunicado by police authorities and being accountable in governance.
""Release those arbitrarily arrested
and an end to extrajudicial killings among other demands. Many of their
demands, in our view, do not require policy dialogue but decisive executive
action,"" said Amnesty.
The nationwide protests have shown a stark
dejection among the Kenyan youth against President William Ruto's government,
with some even calling for his resignation and the withdrawal of his Cabinet.
During a round-table session in State House
on Sunday, President Ruto said that he will ensure no police force is used
against peaceful protesters as Kenyans stage to take the streets this Tuesday
and Thursday.

https://www.citizen.digital/lifestyle/debunked-will-you-get-the-flu-or-cold-after-being-rained-on-n345610,"Debunked: Will you get the flu or cold after being rained on?
The Nairobi weather seems to have taken a
turn to the gloomy side, with heavy clouds covering the sky, ushering in the
cold July weather.
This is the season where people get out their
warm coats and umbrellas to shield themselves from the cold and the rain.
During this season there is a common myth and
misconception that when one is rained on they may contract a flu or a cold.
Citizen Digital spoke to Dr. Raphael Wanga, the
General Practitioner at Marina Healthcare, who debunked this myth.
Dr. Wanga first explained the difference
between a flu and a cold, terms that many people tend to confuse.
“Flu is generally caused by the influenza
virus, while colds are caused by a variety of viruses but mostly called the
Rhino virus,” he said.
“A flu tends to generally affect the lower
respiratory system and causes Pneumonia and other lower respiratory problems
such as breathing, while common colds affect the upper respiratory system. Some
common symptoms are sneezing, nasal congestion, throat irritation, headache and
fevers.”
The doctor added that flu is usually more
severe than a cold because its symptoms are a combination of the symptoms of
both the lower and upper respiratory systems.
Dr. Wanga noted that it is not directly true
that one gets a flu after being rained on, saying: “During the cold season
people tend to spend a lot of time indoors with the windows closed, meaning no
flow of fresh air. Usually the flu is airborne so when there is no flow of air,
one may acquire a flu.”
For the colds, he stated: “The lining of the
nose usually has its own protective mechanism to prevent viruses. It produces
extracellular vesicles which prevents viruses from getting into the body.
During the cold season, the number of vesicles reduce, meaning any time one is
predisposed to the virus since there is not enough protection.”
The doctor highlighted ways to prevent one
from acquiring a flu or cold.
”Viruses tend to spread easily because they
are airborne, hence it’s important to wear face masks which reduce the chance
of acquiring viruses by 90%,” he said.
“The second thing is hand washing; every time
you greet somebody who sneezed on their hand, you may acquire the virus because
it stays on the body for approximately two hours.”
The medical practitioner further cautioned
people against using antibiotics to treat flu or colds.
“Flu or colds are caused by viruses,
antibiotics target bacteria, hence the antibiotic does nothing. Continuous use
of antibiotics causes the body to have resistance, meaning the pathogens in the
body will get used to it,” stated Dr. Wanga.
“This means that when one needs antibiotic to
fight bacteria, the body will not use it which will be very sad. Use
antihistamines, decongestants and paracetamols.”
Dr. Wanga concluded by saying that medicines
do not heal flu and colds, but rather just mitigate the symptoms. Home remedies
such as hot water and lemon are also recommended.

https://www.citizen.digital/opinion-blogs/opinion-social-media-achieved-more-than-expected-in-kenya-anti-tax-protests-n345204,"OPINION: Social Media Achieved More Than Expected in Kenya Anti-Tax Protests
No structure yet successful, no leader yet triumphant – that’s what the recent anti-tax protests in Kenya, also dubbed ‘Gen Z protests’, have been seen to be.
The question that lingers is: can the success or sheer scale of these protests be attributed to social media? What role did social media play in rallying young people to occupy Parliament and get the President not to sign the Finance Bill 2024? Can we draw parallels between these protests and the Arab Spring solely based on social media involvement? Is social media being credited more than the ‘street’, or vice versa?
This debate can go both ways, but the undeniable role of social media in these protests cannot be overlooked.
RAISING AWARENESS AND SPARKING DISCONTENT
TikTok was the single greatest influencer of the #RejectFinanceBill2024 conversation, with videos reaching over 500 million views.
According to Nendo – a digital research agency based in Nairobi, Kenya – the youth, particularly the age group that makes up the “Gen Z” generation and have mastered the platform, led the charge to raise awareness about the Bill.
Users dissected its contents, breaking them down for their followers and translating them into local dialects such as Dholuo, Ekegusii, Kikuyu, Bukusu, Maragoli, and Taita among others. Complementing this was the infusion of artificial intelligence (AI) tools to simplify and explain the bill’s clauses innovatively.
Finance Bill GPT, an AI tool created by Kelvin Onkundi, from popular AI chatbot ChatGPT to help Kenyans understand the contentious Finance Bill 2024 engaged over 10,000 users.
As awareness grew, so did the discontent over the Bill’s controversial provisions, fuelling anger and momentum. On X (formerly Twitter) the top anti-finance bill conversations were driven by #RejectFinanceBill2024, #OccupyParliament, and #RutoMustGo tags, which had over 25 million mentions between June 12 and July 1 2024, according to Nendo.
The topics that sparked the most outrage, considering the sentiment analysis that qualifies the emotions in the social media posts, included vernacular translations of the impact, clauses, corruption allegations, and frustration with the political class. As the Bill went through parliamentary readings and was passed, and as reports of abductions of content creators flew around, the groundswell of negative conversation peaked – with the highest peak in conversations being Tuesday, June 25, when some of the protesters stormed Kenya’s parliament buildings.
DISSEMINATING RAGE AND MOBILISING ACTION
Social media channels became the primary tools for disseminating this rage and calling for action. X, for example, while providing a platform for political discourse, hosted the conversations that were used for analysis and brainstorming sessions – all of which can be argued to have played a part in fuelling the rage.
It is through platforms like X Spaces that the topic momentum was shifted whenever reality on the ‘ground’ shifted, e.g., #RejectNotAmend when parliamentarians noted they would amend contentious clauses of the bill.
Calls for better governance were amplified, with hashtags such as #OccupyStatehouse or #RutoMustGo gaining momentum after the bill was dropped. The hashtags made it easy for people to track updates related to the movement.
Additionally, key influencers on this platform seized the moment to announce their support for the protests, which significantly extended the movement’s reach and added credibility. Protest organisers and participants also utilised X for real-time updates, sharing live information on protest plans, active locations, and progress of the protests, thereby keeping participants informed and motivated.
Despite some detractors arguing that social media’s role was overstated, it undeniably provided a platform for generating dialogue, expanding camaraderie, and unifying thought and purpose. It emboldened users, transforming passive observers into active participants. Phrases like “the fear is gone” and “we will be there no matter what” served to strengthen resolve.
IMPACT OF TIKTOK, X, OTHER PLATFORMS
From the analysis, TikTok’s influence was unmatched. Users, especially influencers, posted their original content regarding the bill here, and only exported them to other platforms. X and other ‘old guard platforms’ like Facebook and LinkedIn, dominated by older users, amplified the message to a broader, maturer audience.
This phenomenon can be explained by today’s social media usage trends in Kenya.
According to the 2024 digital trends report, TikTok had 10.60 million users aged 18 and above in Kenya in early 2024, compared to X’s 1.87 million users. TikTok came second only to WhatsApp in usage, with 70.2% of social media users aged 16-64 engaging with the platform each month. This is followed by Facebook (68.5%), Instagram (67.8%), and X (56.8%). Telegram, which on the protest day saw a surge when X was seen to have been stifled by the government, had 43.8%, and LinkedIn lagged at 32%.
An interesting angle to this entire conversation is the aspect of social proof – not just being an online supporter, but an offline/realtime protestor which perhaps generated more on-ground participation. Influential users had to live up to the expectations of their followers who would demand social proof of their involvement ‘on the ground’. It could be seen that on protest days, these influencers shared real-time clips of themselves demonstrating, being tear-gassed, and carrying placards. This visibility was crucial as it showed their genuine belief in the protests and the necessity of rejecting the finance bill. Conversely, influencers who seemed to support the bill faced cancellation.
THE DARK SIDE
The detriments of social media were also evident, with misinformation spreading rapidly. Unconfirmed reports of massacres and inflated death tolls circulated before being debunked – a case in point being the reported police activity in the Githurai area of Nairobi.
At the same time, sharing personal information of parliamentarians and law enforcement officers led to unintended harm. In the wake of reports of politically motivated abductions, it is understood that some law enforcement agencies used social media to locate and arrest influential users, actions widely condemned as state abductions.
REAL-TIME COMMUNICATION AND PROTECTION
When the anti-finance bill demonstrations took a frightening turn with reports of the use of live bullets by the police, leading to the death of young protesters, social media also played a protective role by broadcasting live scenes, sharing footage of police brutality, and preventing officers from acting with what is considered as impunity.
However, some users seized this moment to gain monetary value through platforms like TikTok, where live streams attracted gifts from viewers. However, through it all, the youth maintained a sense of community and unity, and this was also seen through online campaigns to call for justice and bring those who are missing home.
Supporters came together to raise over Ksh.14 million through M-Changa Africa. The crowdfunding platform said that the funds would be used to cover medical bills, rehabilitation costs, and other needs arising from the demonstrations.
This blend of real-time communication, community building, and transparent fundraising demonstrated the transformative potential of digital activism, illustrating how everyday technology can power significant social change.
Despite the challenges and drawbacks, the role of social media in these protests was undeniable, proving that in today's digital age, the voice of the people can be amplified like never before.
So, did social media achieve more than what it set out to do in the Kenya anti-tax protests? The answer seems to be a resounding yes.
The movement did not just mobilise masses; it created a new paradigm of civic engagement – Mark Kaigwa, the founder & CEO of Nendo, calls it a new ‘Political Constituency’ – transcending traditional boundaries of activism. The anti-tax protesters occupied Parliament and led to the withdrawal of the Finance Bill, both products of the most popular hashtags of the week.
The ability of social media to raise awareness, generate real-time discourse, and mobilise action on such a large scale indicates that its role was not just instrumental but transformational. You can call it ‘from Tweets to Streets’.

(Photo by Adrian DENNIS / AFP)
England manager Gareth Southgate believes his side have been freed up by edging closer to a first ever major final on foreign soil at Euro 2024 after struggling to deal with the weight of expectation earlier in the tournament.
The Three Lions arrived in Germany as one of the favourites thanks to a richly-talented squad and an upturn in their fortunes under Southgate.
England are into a third semi-final in four tournaments, where they will face the Netherlands in Dortmund on Wednesday.
But they have never reached a final outside of England or won the European Championship before.
Southgate's men have been heavily criticised for their performances at Euro 2024, where they have won only one of their five games in 90 minutes.
But he said his players showed signs of what they are capable of in a quarter-final win over Switzerland on penalties after needing a late Bukayo Saka equaliser to send the game to extra time.
""One of our strengths over the last eight years has been less fear, less inhibiton but at the beginning the expectation weighed heavily,"" said Southgate at his pre-match press conference on Tuesday.
""We couldn't quite get ourselves in the right place and in the end what was impressive was the players ground results out.
""Now we are into that moment in the tournament where it is what is possible? What is achievable? Rather than, what could go wrong?
""That is different for a player. This is now the chance to make history, first time to make a final not held in England.
""We are trying to break new ground and that is difficult, but the players have responded brilliantly.""

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/djokovic-eyes-sweet-16-as-murrays-wimbledon-career-ends-with-whimper-n345342,"Djokovic eyes sweet 16 as Murray's Wimbledon career ends with whimper
Djokovic is looking to equal Roger Federer's record of eight Wimbledon triumphs and claim a 25th Grand Slam title in total.
He barely broke sweat in his opening match but was pushed to four sets in his second encounter by British rookie Jacob Fearnley, who was still playing college tennis in the United States last month.
Just weeks after a right knee operation, Djokovic feels he is not yet fully up to speed.
""It's not where I want it to be,"" he said. ""The longer I stay in the tournament, I think the better the chances that my movement will improve.""
On Saturday, he tackles Alexei Popyrin, whom he beat in four sets at the Australian Open earlier this year.
With defending champion Carlos Alcaraz and top-ranked Jannik Sinner on the other side of the draw, and safely into the fourth round, Djokovic can see a clear path to a sixth straight final at the All England Club.
Popyrin, the world number 47, has never made the second week of a Slam.
Meanwhile, Murray's 19-year Wimbledon career finished with a whimper when Raducanu withdrew from their mixed doubles partnership.
Former world number one Murray, who will retire after the Paris Olympics, didn't play singles after failing to recover from surgery to remove a cyst from his spine.
On Thursday, he and brother Jamie were defeated in the first round of men's doubles.
Murray, the 2013 and 2016 Wimbledon champion, was scheduled to partner Raducanu in Saturday's last match on Court One.
""Unfortunately I woke up with some stiffness in my right wrist so therefore I have decided to make the very tough decision to withdraw from the mixed doubles tonight,"" said Raducanu in a statement.
Raducanu, the 2021 US Open champion, faces New Zealand's Lulu Sun on Sunday for a place in the women's singles quarter-finals.
Djokovic's scheduled semi-final opponent Alexander Zverev was opening play on Centre Court against Cameron Norrie, the last British man in the singles tournament.
Zverev has dropped just 15 games in two rounds and boasts a 5-0 winning record over Norrie.
France's Ugo Humbert defeated Brandon Nakashima of the United States in four sets to set-up a last-16 clash with Alcaraz.
France's Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard, who only made the main draw as a lucky loser from qualifying, has become the player nobody wants to face.
The 2.03 metre (6 feet 8 inches) world number 58 leads the ace count at Wimbledon with 78.
On top of that, the 20-year-old had saved all 13 break points he had faced before Saturday and was bidding to become the first lucky loser into the last 16 since Dick Norman in 1995.
""I'm happy to have this serve which helps me enormously,"" said Mpetshi Perricard, who faces Finland's Emil Ruusuvuori.
In the women's draw, five-time major winner Iga Swiatek has seen off all-comers during an impressive 21-match winning run.
On Saturday, she plays Yulia Putintseva, the diminutive Russian-born Kazakh who rankled the world number one earlier this year with her antics at Indian Wells.
Putintseva was ticked off by the chair umpire for moving from side to side as Swiatek shaped to serve.
Putintseva, who described herself in an interview with the WTA as ""a gangster on court and angel off it"", even threw in a collection of underarm serves.
""Maybe they teach that in Kazakhstan,"" said five-time major winner Swiatek who has yet to get past the quarter-finals at Wimbledon.
Elsewhere, 2022 champion Elena Rybakina plays former world number one Caroline Wozniacki, while two-time runner-up Ons Jabeur takes on Elina Svitolina, a semi-finalist in 2023.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that he had seen fragments of the debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump but that his preference for Biden as the next U.S. president remained unchanged.
Asked by a state television reporter if Biden or Trump was better, if his publicly stated preference for Biden had changed after the debate, and if he had seen it, Putin said:
""Did we not know what could come? We knew,"" Putin added.
Putin has several times said that he feels Biden is preferable as the future U.S. president to Trump, even after Biden cast the Kremlin chief as a ""crazy SOB"".
Putin said that he had seen parts of the debate between Biden and Trump but he had other things to attend to.
""I saw some fragments,"" Putin said. ""But I have enough to do.""
Biden, 81, put in a stumbling performance during the debate, which brought questions about his age and mental fitness to the forefront of the campaign.
Putin said that he paid little attention to partial media reports about the debate though he could not ignore it as the United States remained a great power.
Asked about Trump's statements that he could end the Ukraine war swiftly if he won the presidential election, Putin said Russia took him seriously but had no sense of the details of any of Trump's peace proposals.
""The fact that Mr Trump, as a presidential candidate, declares that he is ready and wants to stop the war in Ukraine, we take this completely seriously,"" Putin said.
""I am not, of course, familiar with possible proposals for how he plans to do this. This is the key question. But I have no doubt that he means it sincerely, and we support it.""

Published on: June 30, 2024 10:28 (EAT)
Slovenia's forward Benjamin Sesko (C) heads the ball next to England's midfielder #04 Declan Rice and Slovenia's forward Andraz Sporar during the UEFA Euro 2024 Group C football match between England and Slovenia at the Cologne Stadium in Cologne on June 25, 2024. (Photo by Kirill KUDRYAVTSEV / AFP)
Slovenia come into their Euro 2024 last-16 match-up with Portugal on Monday knowing they have already achieved their best-ever Euros result - and all without a goal contribution from star striker Benjamin Sesko.
With no goals in three matches so far in Germany, the RB Leipzig striker is due to find the back of the net based on his form this season.
He scored in each of his last seven games for Leipzig as they ended their Bundesliga campaign in the top four and was Slovenia's top scorer in qualifying.
And Sesko has come within a whisker of opening his account at the tournament - against Denmark he went close twice with superb long-range efforts that were just millimetres off target.
The efforts from distance highlight how varied Sesko's skillset is. At 1.95 metres tall, Sesko is dangerous with his head but can also unleash fierce strikes from distance.
With speed to burn and physicality, the 21-year-old striker is already a complete package.
Just one year after moving to Leipzig from sister club Red Bull Salzburg, his attributes have attracted the attention of several elite European sides, including Arsenal and Manchester United.
In June however, he chose to extend his deal at Leipzig until 2029, continuing his development at one of Europe's best finishing schools.
Slovenia may be yet to win a match at Euro 2024 but they are also yet to lose one, having drawn with England, Denmark and Serbia in the group stage.
The 1-1 draw with Serbia was particularly agonising for the Slovenians, who were on course for a first-ever Euros victory before Luka Jovic scored in the fifth minute of injury time to deny them.
Such were the razor-thin margins in Group C that a win may have put Slovenia on course to win the section.
But Slovenia finished the group stage in third spot and missed out on second spot on disciplinary record, having picked up one more yellow card than runners-up Denmark.
Third place in the group means a meeting with 2016 Euros winners Portugal who impressed in the group stage with wins over Czech Republic and Turkey, before a heavily-rotated XI lost to underdogs Georgia in their final match.
Slovenia are taking part in just their second Euros as an independent nation, having been eliminated at the group stage at Euro 2000.
Their opponents in Frankfurt on Monday, however, have made the semi-finals five times and are among the favourites for the tournament.
Despite a smaller population than many other European heavyweights, Portugal's squad rivals the quality of many larger nations.
Front and centre is Portugal forward Cristiano Ronaldo, who is the biggest star at the tournament despite being in the twilight of his career.
Like Sesko, Ronaldo is also yet to get on the scoresheet.
The 39-year-old veteran may not be the player he once was but he has contributed for his side, uncharacteristically opting not to shoot before laying off an assist to Bruno Fernandes to seal the win against Turkey.
This tournament, the Portuguese superstar became the first player to feature at the Euros six times. With 14 goals, he already holds the record for most strikes in European Championship history.
Sesko was just one year old when a teenage Ronaldo went all the way to the Euro 2004 final on home soil and was seen in tears after a surprise 1-0 loss to underdogs Greece.
With all the pressure on Ronaldo and Portugal, Slovenia and Sesko will be eyeing a similar underdog story on Monday in Frankfurt.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/ncck-urges-swift-reconstitution-of-iebc-to-empower-electorates-in-mp-recall-efforts-n344819,"NCCK urges swift reconstitution of IEBC to empower electorates in MP recall efforts
The recent protests against the Finance Bill have ignited a fresh debate on the reconstitution of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) with the National Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK) emphasizing the electorate's right to recall their Members of Parliament whom they feel failed them during the Finance Bill debate.
Canon Chris Kinyanjui, the Secretary General of the NCCK, expressed dissatisfaction with the delays in reconstituting the IEBC, viewing it as a significant obstacle to recalling underperforming parliamentarians.
“It is the right of the voters to recall their MPs and without IEBC, it won’t be possible. That is why I am calling all the stakeholders including the young people to push for the reconstitution of the IEBC as soon as yesterday,” said Mr. Kinyanjui.
""Reconstitution of the IEBC is the only way we can use to recall some of the MPs who supported the Finance Bill, yet the voters told them not to do that,"" he reiterated.
The NCCK also warned MPs against prioritizing their interests over those of their constituents and urged them to consider the people's needs when passing bills in parliament.
This call for action comes amid widespread protests in various parts of the country, where properties belonging to MPs who voted in favour of the controversial Finance Bill 2024 have been vandalized and torched.
One notable incident involved the home of Molo MP and Chair of the National Assembly Finance Committee, Kimani Kuria, which was vandalized and torched by angry protesters.
The NCCK further announced stringent measures to curb political activities within church settings, particularly the practice of distributing money in places of worship.
""We don't want them (politicians) to be allowed to speak inside the congregation of the church,"" stated Mr. Kinyanjui.
Regarding the anti-Finance Bill protests, the NCCK condemned the police for teargassing peaceful demonstrators and urged law enforcement to uphold Article 37 of the Kenyan Constitution by providing security during protests.
The Council also appealed to all three branches of government and the police to fulfil their roles responsibly to prevent further overreach.

Taking to X on Wednesday, Raila said he had received feedback that Kenyans were not interested in a handshake.
He was speaking after meeting with several ODM leaders, including Nairobi Senator Edwin Sifuna, Migori Senator Eddie Oketch, and Senator Cyrstal Asige.
""Nimeambiwa na hawa viongozi kwamba mumesema hamtaki handshake,"" Raila said.
""Ujumbe umefika.""
Nimeambiwa na hawa viongozi kwamba mumesema hamtaki handshake. Ujumbe umefika. pic.twitter.com/wy7GKTez1o
The Azimio leader was speaking a day after he has agreed to have a dialogue with President William Ruto to discuss the current crisis facing the nation.
The two leaders agreed to commence a six-day multi-sectorial forum which is set to begin on Monday, July 15, and end on Saturday to foster national dialogue and seek lasting solutions to Kenya's pressing issues following the Gen Z-driven anti-taxation protests.
""I am happy to confirm that we have had consultations and we have agreed that dialogue is the way forward out of the crisis that we’re having today in our country,"" said Mr Odinga.
Raila's move rubbed Kenyan youth---mainly Gen Z's--wrong, as they accused him of dining with the Head of State for his own personal gain.
Odinga's 2022 General Election running mate Martha Karua termed the move ""a trap"", adding that it will hinder the existence of meaningful talks to iron out the demands for Gen Zs.
""I agree with those who say Action Now on the clear and attainable demands of the GenZ to enhance accountability and make the state work for the masses rather than for a handful elites,"" she wrote on X.
""Let’s be careful as the political class lest we hijack the genuine clamor for accountability and reforms by the GenZ. This is a trap period.""
Odinga's biological son also chimed into the online clamor, seemingly distancing himself from his father's opinions saying ""Everybody is an individual please! Even people with the same exact names.""
Other Kenyans hopped on the ridicule bandwagon insisting that dialogue between Odinga and the government has always collapsed and he will not be allowed to represent the youth in any capacity whatsoever.
Odinga's private credentials including his mobile phone numbers were later paraded on the platform, customary to how any individual acting against the demands of the Gen Z has been treated.
Photoshopped images showing Odinga donning a UDA t-shirt were also being shared widely by the time of this publication.
X user 5peopleke said ""Raila, as you go ahead and dialogue, kindly don't involve us. Discuss your private matters. You don't speak on our behalf.""
Another user Cornelius Ronoh said ""The dialogue is between two individuals; William Ruto and Raila Odinga. We refuse to be controlled by selfish politicians who only value their stomachs. Gen Zs and Millennials are now taking the bull by the horns. Hatupangwingwi. They will not believe!""

Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) Secretary General Angela Luchivya says the anti-Finance Bill protests have depleted the league programme after the federation was forced to put on hold the end-of-season playoffs which were set to continue this weekend.
Recent demonstrations against the-already-withdrawn Finance Bill 2024 have resulted in deaths, looting and hundreds of injuries, and Luchivya says players’ safety informed their decision to postpone the playoffs.
“Some of the teams that are participating are universities and most of them have sent students home for online classes. It’s (actually) demonstrations that forced us to postpone the games. We didn’t think it was safe to have people in one venue when there were demonstrations.
“We had also said on Friday we can’t have late night games because we don’t know how safe it will be for players to get home, it was just more about the safety side,” said Luchivya.
Game Three, Four and Five of the semi-final playoffs were slated for this weekend with finals tickets of the league up for grabs.
Meanwhile, Zetech Sparks head coach Maurice Obilo has backed his charges to bounce back from Game Two defeat against Equity Hawks in the women’s playoffs.
Sparks had defeated Equity Hawks 62-50 in Game One of the playoffs in the five-game series before the latter turned the tables on the students, losing Game Two 59-69 last Sunday at Nyayo Gymnasium.
“Up to this point I believe my girls have given their best. We didn’t get a few things right in Sunday’s game but these are things that are correctable. So heading into the third game definitely we will be coming out strong,” said Obilo.
Obilo is hopeful the students will punch the final ticket once the playoffs resume.
“We failed to get better shots, give right passes and also make some defensive stops which are some of the things that made us lose the game on Sunday. Some major issues were also on our free throws, the percentage was too low, otherwise the girls are giving their best and I trust they will do well.”
Zetech need to win two of the remaining three games to qualify to the final, which they also appeared in last season’s playoffs by defeating the same opponent.

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/verstappen-resists-norris-attack-to-win-austrian-gp-sprint-race-n344917,"Verstappen resists Norris attack to win Austrian GP sprint race
Max Verstappen resisted a spirited attack from Lando Norris on Saturday to
claim victory for Red Bull in a feisty sprint race at the Austrian Grand Prix.
The series leader and three-time world champion delivered a home win at the Red Bull Ring with a fighting response after being passed by McLaren's Norris in the opening laps.
His win was his third sprint triumph this year, his fifth in succession and his 10th in 15 contests as he came home 4.616 seconds ahead of McLaren's Oscar Piastri and 5.348 clear of Norris, who was unable to maintain his early speed.
""I had a good first lap,"" said Verstappen. ""But once the DRS (Drag Reduction System) opened it took a few laps for me to get away and then I drove my own race. I had to work for it in that race and we have a few things to think about for tomorrow.""
George Russell finished fourth for Mercedes ahead of Ferrari's Carlos Sainz and seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton in the second Mercedes. Charles Leclerc in the second Ferrari was seventh.
Sergio Perez came home eighth in the second Red Bull ahead of Haas's Kevin Magnussen and Lance Stroll of Aston Martin.
Verstappen was given a rousing reception by the massed ranks of his 'orange army' in the grandstands, notably roaring with delight when he responded to snatch back his lead from Norris.
On a hot day in the Styrian Alps, Verstappen made a strong start from pole, after two formation laps, to lead through Turn One ahead of Norris with Piastri hustling his team-mate – and Sainz passing Russell for fourth.
The whole grid started on medium tyres, hoping to survive the rising temperatures and complete the distance of 24 laps, reduced to 23, without alarm.
The McLarens stayed in close proximity and threatened not only each other but the leader as they searched for space to pass, all three cars separated by less than six-tenths of a second.
Having made several moves, Norris finally found a way past the Dutchman at the top of the hill on lap five, but Verstappen responded immediately and regained the lead at the next corner allowing Piastri to use his momentum to take second.
Norris, who was feeling unwell before the race, was left struggling to resist the charging Sainz while Piastri set off in pursuit of Verstappen.
By lap eight, the Mercedes were producing a measured helping of pace and this allowed Russell to pass Sainz on the outside of Turn Four for fourth with the help of Drag Reduction System (DRS).
Hamilton, in sixth, closed steadily on Sainz, who clung on while his Ferrari team-mate Leclerc rose from 10th to seventh, but was unable to make any further impression.
At the front, Verstappen relaxed after regaining control and moved out of DRS reach for Piastri who, by lap 15, was looking in his mirrors to see team-mate Norris closing in again. Verstappen led by two seconds.
As it unfolded, it was Verstappen controlling affairs and opening up a gap of more than four seconds as he cruised home before turning his attention to preparations for Grand Prix qualifying taking place later Saturday.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/anti-tax-protests-123-people-charged-for-looting-destroying-property-worth-ksh100m-in-naivasha-n344871,"Anti-tax protests: 123 people charged for looting, destroying property worth Ksh.100M in Naivasha
Over 100 people, among them 15 minors, have
been charged in a Naivasha court for allegedly raiding and looting property
worth over Ksh.100 million during the recent wave of anti-Finance Bill 2024 demonstrations.
The
123 suspects, who also included 19 women, were accused of looting Naivas
Supermarket, Naivasha MP’s office and EPCO hotel where they left a trail of
destruction.
The
incident came as police heightened patrols in the town mainly near supermarkets
while launching a search for property stolen from the supermarket.
During
the incident, a group of youths first raided the MP's office and the adjacent
hotel before heading to the supermarket where police nabbed them.
The
suspects were charged on Friday virtually before Naivasha Principal Magistrate
Juliana Nd’engeri with three counts including stealing, malicious damage and being
in possession of stolen goods.
They
were charged that on June 25, 2024 in Naivasha town, they raided the
supermarket and stole and damaged property worth over Ksh.70 million.
The
suspects who were unrepresented faced two other charges of raiding the MP’s
office and EPCO hotel and stealing property worth over Ksh. 30 million.
They
all denied the charges levelled against them and were released on a cash bond
of Ksh.200,000 and a surety of the same or a cash bail of Ksh.100,000, failure
to which they be remanded at Naivasha Remand Prison.
The
case will come up for mention on July 16, 2024.
Police
have since heightened security in the town while seeking more suspects involved
in the robbery and torching of businesses in the town.
According
to Naivasha OCPD Stephen Kirui, more armed anti-riot officers drawn from the prisons
and the Anti-Stock Theft Unit have been dispatched to the town.
He
termed the town as very peaceful, adding that they were not taking chances and
had heightened patrols.
""They

Kazakhstan
athlete Norah Jeruto, born in Kenya, has triumphed in her doping case against
the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).
Jeruto, who
claimed gold in steeplechase for Kazakhstan at the 2022 World Championships,
was unable to defend her title last year due to a provisional suspension.
Reports indicated
irregularities in her biological passport, but no banned substances were found
in her system.
The case centered
on whether blood samples from 2020 and 2021 showed abnormalities that could
constitute anti-doping rule violations.
Jeruto attributed
the unusual test results to stomach ulcers and a bout of COVID-19.
CAS issued a
statement confirming that the decision, which found Jeruto not in violation of
the World Athletics Anti-Doping Rules regarding the alleged abnormalities in
her Athlete Biological Passport (ABP), has been upheld.
World Athletics
had appealed the decision, seeking a four-year ban for Jeruto. However, CAS
announced on Tuesday that the appeal had been dismissed.
“In its appeal to
CAS, World Athletics had sought the imposition of a four-year period of
ineligibility. The CAS panel held a hearing on June 17 and 18, 2024, and, after
deliberation, issued the operative part of its decision today, dismissing the
appeal,” the statement said.
Jeruto, who
switched her allegiance to Kazakhstan, won the world 3000m steeplechase title
in Eugene in 2022 with a championship record of 8:53.02 – the third-fastest
time in history.
Prior to her nationality
switch, she won the African Championships in 2016 and the Diamond League title
in 2021 representing Kenya.
Jeruto also
claimed the world Under-18 title in the 2000m steeplechase in 2011, but missed
the Tokyo Olympics due to her nationality change.
Jeruto is now set to compete at the Paris Olympic Games.

The family of Denzel Omondi Onyango, one of
the protesters who tragically died under mysterious circumstances during the
recent anti-government demonstrations, is demanding answers.
Denzel was among thousands of protesters who
stormed Parliament premises during the protests on June 25. He subsequently
went viral after recording a video inside the Parliament.
Unfortunately, things took a tragic turn just
a day after he posted the video on social media.
The 24-year-old, a third year JKUAT student,
was reported missing on June 27. His parents subsequently mounted a search to
no avail.
A week later, Denzel’s body was discovered at
a quarry within Gachororo in Juja, Kiambu County.
Investigators at Juja Police Station have
taken statements from the deceased’s parents, even as the family insists that their
son was abducted and murdered after the video of him protesting at Parliament
buildings went viral.
Denzel’s grief-stricken family is overwhelmed
by the loss of their eldest child.
His father spoke to him on July 27, just
hours before he disappeared without a trace. Efforts for the family to trail
the young man hit a dead end when they were called to identify his body.
“The investigative agencies have to tell us
what really caused this, because I spoke to this boy three hours before he went
missing and he was in a good mood,” said Denzel’s father James Otieno.
An autopsy examination has since revealed that
Denzel died by drowning, however his family and human rights defenders are not
convinced with the findings.
As this happened, investigators and
Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) representatives revisited the
crime scene on Wednesday to chronologically analyse events leading up to the
boy’s death.
For now, investigators say they are still
piecing together details into this incident and a detailed statement on the
progress of the probe will be issued soon.

Published on: July 07, 2024 08:00 (EAT)

The scoresheet may not reflect it but the key to the Netherlands' progress to the Euro 2024 semi-finals was target man Wout Weghorst.
The Dutch came from behind to beat Turkey 2-1 in Berlin on Saturday in a tense quarter-final, with the balance tipped in their favour by the burly Burnley striker's appearance from the bench.
With Turkey comfortably sitting 1-0 up at half-time fervently backed by raucous support at the Olympiastadion, Ronald Koeman rolled the dice and called for his wildcard option.
Weghorst burst into football's global consciousness with a stunning brace as a substitute against Argentina in the 2022 World Cup quarter-final and is still devastating in that role.
The 31-year-old six-foot-six striker rescued the Netherlands a 2-1 win over Poland in their Euros opener with a well-taken goal off the bench.
Koeman restricted Weghorst to 44 minutes across the Netherlands' opening four matches but gave him a full 45 against Turkey and it paid dividends, as the team booked a semi-final date with England.
Instantly the Dutch had a target to aim for in the box, with Memphis Depay's drifting denying them a focal point until Weghorst's appearance.
""Because of (Weghorst) you create a little bit more chaos in the box and they have to defend more, so I think Wout helped a lot,"" said Dutch defender Nathan Ake.
""He's a nightmare to play against. He is strong, is a nuisance in a box and he fights for everything. He runs off everything. So for us he is a great asset.""
Weghorst, who spent the season on loan at Hoffenheim, put the jitters into Turkey's previously solid defence.
Mert Gunok's save from Weghorst led to the corner from which the Netherlands equalised, with Stefan de Vrij heading home Depay's cross.
With the Turkish rear-guard tying themselves in knots to stifle Weghorst, the Netherlands netted again six minutes later with Mert Muldur, under pressure from Cody Gakpo, bundling into his own net from Denzel Dumfries' raking ball.
""We started quite well but it changed after 20 minutes, (then) they were dominating,"" explained Koeman.
""Then it was clear for me to make this substitution with Wout, with Cody on the wing and Denzel on the right, we had to have a lot more crosses than in the first half.""
Liverpool winger Gakpo leads the Netherlands squad for goals and is also the competition's joint-top scorer with three strikes in Germany, but he paid tribute to Weghorst's huge impact off the bench.
""It's different (with him on)... in this game when we wanted to play a little bit more opportunistically, then you can bring Wout because he's tall, he's good in the air, he fights for every ball that comes in the box,"" Gakpo told reporters.
""So, that's what we tried in the second half in the beginning. We played some good crosses and then we saw the Turkish side dropping a little bit more, so we could play better.
""Maybe that was the key today. I'm very happy that Wout could be Wout today. Top.""
Next up for the Dutch is England, a country where Weghorst has struggled to make much of an impact.
He signed for Burnley in 2022 from Wolfsburg but only netted twice in 20 games with his side relegated from the Premier League.
A half-season loan to Manchester United ended with no top flight goals in 17 appearances, so making an impact against the Three Lions would provide him with some extra satisfaction.
Koeman said earlier in the tournament Weghorst has ""English qualities"" and was certainly an option to start, even though it has not happened yet.
Given his ability to make a difference as a plan B, Koeman may wish to keep him in reserve as the 1988 winners face their first Euros semi-final since 2004 on Wednesday in Dortmund.

They said that earnings from the tea sector would significantly rise with value addition and establishment of more markets for Kenyan tea brands.
Led by Gabriel Kagombe, who was re-elected as a Director for Ndarugu Tea factory to serve for a period of another three years, the farmers said that Kenyan tea can top globally as the most consumed product and compete with countries like China and Sri Lanka.
Kagombe noted that the government has already implemented a raft of reforms that has seen farmers' earnings improve, adding that all loopholes where farmers’ hard earned money was being pilfered and siphoned by cartels have been sealed.
He said that the majority of tea produced in the country is sold at the Mombasa auction in bulk, adding that it's time the government invests in value addition to the crop that's considered as one of top foreign income earners for the country.
Kagombe said that smallholder tea factories have already started expanding their baskets through innovative ways including embarking on production of orthodox tea that fetches high prices in the international markets. He cited that orthodox tea production line that is being installed at Ndarugu tea factory which is expected to begin operations in January next year.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/biden-digs-in-as-democrats-consider-forcing-him-out-of-presidential-race-n345311,"Biden digs in as Democrats consider forcing him out of presidential race
U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday battled to put down an uprising among some Democrats pushing him to abandon his reelection campaign after a poor debate performance, vowing that ""I'm staying in the race.""
In a fiery speech to supporters in Wisconsin and in an ABC News interview, Biden argued he is the best Democratic candidate to prevent Republican Donald Trump from regaining the White House in the Nov. 5 election.
Biden's halting performance at his debate with Trump on June 27 raised serious concerns among some Democrats about his mental acuity and stamina at age 81.
There is a movement afoot in the party to persuade him to step aside, with critics warning he faces near-certain defeat and could drag other Democrats down with him.
House Democrats and a group of senators are expected to convene on the topic when they return to Washington next week.
Some public opinion polls have shown Trump widening a lead since the debate, and a Reuters/Ipsos poll found that one in three Democrats want Biden to quit the race.
Biden rejected the movement on Friday.
""We had a little debate last week. Can’t say it was my best performance. But ever since then there’s been a lot of speculation. ‘What’s Joe gonna do? Is he gonna stay in the race? Is he gonna drop out?"" Biden said. ""Well here’s my answer: I am running and gonna win again.""
Biden used a 22-minute ABC News interview to argue again that he simply had a bad night at the debate but was otherwise fine.
Under persistent questioning from ABC interviewer George Stephanopoulos, Biden dismissed polls that showed him trailing Trump and said other polls have him in a better position.
Asked if he had undergone a specific cognitive test for a neurological exam, Biden said he had not had one and ""no one said I had to."" The rigors of the White House are sufficient, he said.
In his last physical exam on Feb. 28 he was determined to be fit for duty.
Biden added he was the best candidate to take on Trump and that only ""Lord almighty"" could oust him from the race.
Biden's latest efforts to convince Democrats to stick with him were dismissed by some, although he seemed determined to fight on.
""He seems not to be able to compute the fact that people have these questions about him,"" Democratic strategist David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, told CNN.
""It’s pretty clear that he’s not going anywhere unless there’s a major revolt on the Hill,"" a senior Democratic National Committee official told Reuters.
Senator Mark Warner, a well-respected moderate Democrat, is inviting Democratic senators to a meeting on Monday to discuss Biden's campaign, a source told Reuters. The Washington Post reported Warner was seeking to ask the group to press Biden to exit the race.
Biden told reporters he had spoken to at least 20 lawmakers and that they were telling him to stay. Asked about Warner's call for him to go, Biden said: ""Well, Mark Warner, to my understanding, is the only one considering that.""
At the rally, Biden said he was thankful for the support of his vice president, Kamala Harris, who has emerged as a top choice to replace him were he to step aside as the Democratic Party's standard-bearer.
One person at the Madison rally held up a sign behind Biden that said, ""Pass the torch, Joe.""
Harris posted a supportive note on X after the rally, saying Biden had devoted his life to fighting for Americans. ""In this moment, I know all of us are ready to fight for him,"" she said.
But Illinois Democratic Representative Mike Quigley, on MSNBC, called on Biden to step aside and ""let someone else do this"" or risk ""utter catastrophe.""
In his appearances on Friday, Biden knocked Trump's intelligence and called him a liar, delivering stinging attacks that were absent when he appeared on the Atlanta debate stage.
But he had sharper words for those in his party who doubt his ability to lead them to victory on Nov. 5.
""They're trying to push me out of the race. Well let me say this as clearly as I can: I'm staying in the race! I'll beat Donald Trump. I will beat him again in 2020,"" Biden said, getting the year wrong. He followed up by saying: ""And by the way we're going to do it again in 2024.""
DONORS, BUSINESS LEADERS, ALLIES
A handful of donors and business leaders are making their displeasure with Biden's candidacy known loudly, halting funding or looking at possible Democratic alternatives.
Even some of Biden's closest political allies, including former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have raised questions about his health.
Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey issued a statement on Friday asking Biden to weigh the decision carefully, the rare Democratic governor not to issue a statement of support in recent days.
""President Biden saved our democracy in 2020 and has done an outstanding job over the last four years,"" she said.
""The best way forward right now is a decision for the president to make. Over the coming days, I urge him to listen to the American people and carefully evaluate whether he remains our best hope to defeat Donald Trump.""
Trump's campaign and some of his allies have launched a pre-emptive political strike on Harris, moving swiftly to try to discredit her.
Trump, 78, who made multiple false statements during the debate in Atlanta, falsely claimed in a video that was circulated on social media that he had driven Biden out of the race. He made disparaging comments about Harris in the same video, which the Trump campaign stood by.
A group of business and civic leaders urged Biden to end his reelection bid in a letter to the White House on Friday, a day after its CEO said members would still back him if he continued to run, the Washington Post reported.
Biden's former chief of staff, Ron Klain, who led his preparation process ahead of the debate, pushed back against donors' complaints.
""We are the Democratic Party!"" he wrote on X. Donors ""don't get to decide to oust a pro-labor pro-people President.""

Kenyan police arrived in violence-ravaged Haiti on Tuesday on a mission to defeat the Caribbean nation's powerful gangs, just as deadly unrest gripped Nairobi during mass protests.

Kenyan President William Ruto had ceremonially seen the police off a day earlier in Nairobi, in what he described as a ""historic"" mission of solidarity.
But Kenya on Tuesday was also engulfed in violence, with protesters breaching parliament and a fire erupting at the governor's office.
Footage showed police trying to douse the flames at City Hall with a water cannon, and rights groups accused officers of firing live rounds, leaving one dead and many wounded.

Reigning women's Olympic 800 metres champion Athing Mu will not defend her title at next month's Paris Games after suffering a dramatic fall at the US trials in Eugene, Oregon on Monday.
The 22-year-old, one of the sensations of the pandemic-delayed 2021 Tokyo Games, crashed to the track at around the 200m mark in the final at Hayward Field.
Mu, who was also a member of the USA's victorious 4x400m relay team in Tokyo, crossed the finish line in tears after failing to make up ground following her tumble.
The agonising race highlighted the unforgiving nature of the US Olympic track and field trials, one of the most competitive meetings in world athletics outside of a major championship.
Only the top three finishers of each event qualify for the Olympic squad, which does not take into account other races or performances throughout the season.
Mu, the 2022 world champion, had not raced all season before the trials as she worked her way back from injury.
However she had looked comfortable in the early rounds of the 800m, and had seemed poised to book her place on the Olympic team.
Instead, the US 800m trio in Paris will be headed by Nia Akins, who won in 1min 57.36sec, with Allie Wilson second and Juliette Whittaker third.
In other events on Monday, Quincy Hall won the men's 400m in a time of 44.17sec, pipping Michael Norman, who was second in 44.41sec.
Chris Bailey was third in 44.42 sec, while 16-year-old schoolboy Quincy Wilson missed out on an automatic berth in Paris after finishing in sixth place.
Wilson may still earn an Olympic ticket as part of the 4x400m relay squad.
Meanwhile, world 110m hurdles champion Grant Holloway signaled he is ready to add Olympic gold to his resume after scorching to a world-leading 12.92sec in his first heat.

Addressing journalists in Meru County, Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka commended the youth, now referred to as the Gen Z, for their continued protests against the ruling government and urged them to soldier on.
He further commended the Senate for supporting the need for austerity demanded by Gen Zs adding that the government is largely ailed by corrupt individuals who keep on looting public resources.
""They have carried the spirit of SabaSaba and today as they take the streets I want them to know that the Azimio leadership stands with them,"" said Kalonzo.
""The Senate has stood firm and for once asked for accountability in support of the agenda by GenZ. The corruption continues unabetted, a lot of money is collected and no accountability is there. The problem is not the collection but the consumption, the opulence, and greed by leaders.""
DAP-K party leader Eugene Wamalwa further called for the ousting of President Ruto arguing that all his reforms are just ""cosmetics"" to quell public rage.
""Ruto and his government should know that he and his government no longer enjoys the confidence of the people of Kenya. On this SabaSaba day we would want to urge the Gen Zs that the mission is not done until Zakayo ashuke (Ruto comes down),"" said Wamalwa.
The leaders further commended the youth for commemorating the SabaSaba protests as they take the streets today, July 7, to honour Kenyans killed during the protests.
National rights watchdog Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR) says that the death toll recorded from the nationwide protests hit 39 and 361 were left injured.
Marked as a historical day for Kenya, SabaSaba is commemorated yearly to relinquish memories of July 7, 1990, when nationwide protests took place in Kenya to demand for multiparty democracy.
On the historic day, Kenya witnessed the largest nationwide protests which had been summoned by leaders including Kenneth Matiba and Charles Rubia. The leaders had been arrested a few days before.
Over 20 people are reported to have died in the protest which left thousands injured. As a result, former President Daniel Moi’s government bowed to pressure and allowed political pluralism.

A frustrated grandmother
interrupted Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka’s press briefing on Friday,
seeking information about the whereabouts of her grandson.
Speaking
outside the Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH), Kalonzo was giving a brief of the
current political landscape when Zahara Wanjiru began shouting and demanding that
President William Ruto gives back her grandson, Ishmael Kamau.
She intimated that Kamau was arrested by
police during the Tuesday’s anti-Finance Bill 2024 protests in Githurai.
“Stop all these stories, just a
minute, please I’m begging. What are we supposed to do? Nimetafuta kila mahali,
hawa waliniambia ningoje mpaka kesho. I want just to know, where is my
grandson?” She interjected.
“How many others are crying like
that? Tunasema poleni sana kwa wote ambao wameathirika tangu Tuesday. Naishi
karibu na Rongai and I could hear gunshots up to 8pm,” Kalonzo responded.
Wanjiru was
briefly escorted from the premises before returning and demanding for the
whereabouts of her grandson.
“Sitanyamaza,
where is my grandson? Mmeua watoto sababu gani?” She ranted.
“I don’t
even know how I can continue because she expresses emotions. It is possible for
people who have negative energy to think we may have asked huyo cucu akuje alie
hapa. In fact I was frightened myself, I thought she was going to kick me out,”
Kalonzo remarked.
“That is
reflective of the anguish Kenyans are going through.For me what has happened to
Kenya is a real reawakening. The spirit of Kenyans saying there shall be open
democracy. God save Kenya.”
After Kalonzo concluded his remarks, the grandmother was granted an opportunity to
give her statement to the press.
“Isn’t Ruto
a child? I want my grandson. If not that, I will come to State House. I don’t
know where he is ever since the Githurai incident. He is called Ishmael Kamau,
21 years. Ruto give me my child back or give me yours. You want another ten
years to harm our children, give me my grandson,” she said. “Shoot me 20 times
but I want my grandson.”
On Tuesday
night, videos were shared of gunshots and tear gas canisters which filled the
air in Githurai, with reports alleging that officers used live bullets on the
public.
It is still unclear, how many
lives were lost as a result of the incident that some have termed a massacre.

Rwandans will vote in elections on Monday, with President Paul Kagame widely expected to extend his iron-fisted rule and sweep to victory in a race featuring the same candidates he defeated seven years ago.
Rwanda's de facto ruler since the end of the 1994 genocide, Kagame faces rival bids by Frank Habineza, leader of the Democratic Green Party -- the only authorised opposition -- and Philippe Mpayimana, who is running as an independent.
The 66-year-old Kagame is credited with Rwanda's economic recovery after the genocide, with annual GDP growth averaging 7.2 percent between 2012-2022.
But his regime is widely criticised for stifling political opposition at home, while a UN report has accused Rwandan troops of fighting alongside the M23 rebel militia in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo.
Kagame has won three elections with more than 93 percent of the vote in 2003, 2010 and 2017, taking home nearly 99 percent in the most recent poll.
Habineza secured just 0.48 percent of the vote in 2017, with Mpayimana edging past him with 0.73 percent.
Rwandan courts rejected appeals from prominent opposition figures Bernard Ntaganda and Victoire Ingabire to remove previous convictions that effectively barred them from standing.
The election commission also barred high-profile Kagame critic Diane Rwigara, citing issues with her paperwork -- the second time she was excluded from running.
The daughter of industrialist Assinapol Rwigara, a former major donor to Kagame's Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) before he fell out with its leaders, she was accused of forging documents and arrested in 2017 before being acquitted by the courts a year later.
A total of 9.01 million Rwandans are registered to vote, with the presidential poll being held at the same time as legislative elections for the first time.
The imbalance between Kagame and his rivals has been evident during the three-week campaigning period, as the well-oiled RPF PR machine swung into high gear.
Pennants on cars, flags, posters and banners displayed along roadsides, the red, white and blue colours of the ruling party and its slogans ""Tora Kagame Paul"" (""Vote Paul Kagame"") and ""PK24"" (for ""Paul Kagame 2024"") are everywhere.
In contrast to the thousands-strong crowds attending his rallies, his rivals have struggled to make their voices heard, with barely 100 people showing up to some events.
""I came here to listen what he says but I will vote for Kagame... regardless of the others,"" Beatrice Mpawenimana, 30, told AFP at a meeting organised by Habineza's party in the eastern village of Juru.
""He has given us women a voice, he has brought roads, hospitals, so many things... I want him to be president forever, nobody can replace him.""
Like most Rwandans -- 65 percent of the country's population is aged under 30 -- she has only ever known Kagame as leader.
The bespectacled politician has been in charge of the landlocked nation since his RPF militia routed Hutu extremists responsible for the genocide which left 800,000 dead, mainly Tutsis but also moderate Hutus.
Initially serving as vice-president and defence minister, Kagame was elected president by parliament in 2000 after the resignation of Pasteur Bizimungu.
Since then, he has won elections by universal suffrage three times: 95.05 percent in 2003, 93.08 percent in 2010, and 98.79 percent in 2017.
""The RPF ruling party is quite popular across the country, this is undeniable,"" Rwandan constitutional lawyer and political analyst Louis Gitinywa told AFP.
""As for the election, it is like an exercise that must be done simply to tick a box. There is no real opponent against Kagame.""
Rights groups accuse the government of abuses including repressing freedom of expression and stamping out dissent.
Amnesty International said this week that Rwanda's political opposition faces ""severe restrictions... as well as threats, arbitrary detention, prosecution, trumped-up charges, killings and enforced disappearances.""
Kagame presided over controversial constitution amendments in 2015 which shortened presidential terms from seven to five years and reset the clock for the Rwandan leader, potentially allowing him to rule until 2034.

Starting this month, the machine with a crude head and coke-bottle eyes mounted on a truck -- which can drive on rails -- will be put to use for maintenance work on the firm's network.
Its operator sits in a cockpit on the truck, ""seeing"" through the robot's eyes via cameras and operating its powerful limbs and hands remotely.
With a vertical reach of 12 metres (40 feet), the machine can use various attachments for its arms to carry objects as heavy as 40 kilograms (88 pounds), hold a brush to paint or use a chainsaw.
For now, the robot's primary task will focus on trimming tree branches along rails and painting metal frames that hold cables above trains, the company said.
The technology will help fill worker shortages in ageing Japan as well as reduce accidents such as workers falling from high places or suffering electric shocks, the company says.
""In the future, we hope to use machines for all kinds of maintenance operations of our infrastructure,"" and this should provide a case study for how to deal with the labour shortage, company president Kazuaki Hasegawa told a recent press conference.

Spain coach Luis de la Fuente has ""blind faith"" in his side despite taking on France and their ""one of a kind"" Kylian Mbappe in Tuesday's Euro 2024 semi-final.
Riding a wave of five straight wins, Spain have lit up the tournament, scoring 11 goals on the way to the semi-final.
France have reached the same point despite lacking attacking fluency and are yet to score from open play. France's three strikes have come from one penalty and two own goals.
Mbappe and fellow forward Antoine Griezmann have come under fire for failing to perform, but de la Fuente remained wary, particularly of the French captain.
""These kinds of footballers are unpredictable. You never know where they will appear and they never disappear completely.
""His (Mbappe's) level could be slightly lower than his usual level, but 50 percent of Kylian Mbappe could be 100 percent of any other player.
""A player like this can decide a game at any moment. He's a genius, a world-class player, of which France have many.""
Despite lavishing praise on the 25-year-old French captain, de la Fuente backed his own troops.
""Mbappe is a one of a kind and is exceptional,"" the coach said, but added ""to me my footballers are the best.""
""Knowing their potential, we will try to minimise their virtues.
""I trust we will be able to counteract them. I have blind faith in my team and know we are ready to win tomorrow.""
Spain midfielder Rodri said he was not tuning in to criticisms of the French forward, considered by many to be the best player in the world.
""I don't trust what people say. I know the player he is. He can hurt any team at any time and we will have to be aware of what he does.""
Rodri also pushed back at suggestions France had reached the semi-final on the basis of boring football.
""Some might think they are boring but I don't see football in that way,"" the Manchester City midfielder told reporters.
""They're in the semi-finals and others are not. But we just want to win and play our football -- and not look too much at what they do.""

Musician-turned-activist Kasmuel McOure, known by his stage name Kaskazini, has been found unharmed after reportedly being abducted by police following anti-finance bill protests in Nairobi.
Kaskazini, an alumnus of Alliance Boys High School, was reported missing on Tuesday, June 25, 2024. He was last seen within Nairobi's Central Business District (CBD).
Before his disappearance, he had emerged as a stalwart activist during the demonstrations, rallying Gen Z protesters to vehemently oppose the now rescinded Finance Bill.
Following his reported abduction, the Alliance Old Boys' Club issued an appeal for assistance in locating the vocal activist.
""Dear Esteemed Old Boys and the larger community, We write to you seeking your urgent assistance. Our fellow Old Boy, Kasmuel McOure (Class of 2014) is missing since yesterday (25th June 2024) at 4:00 PM,"" the notice read.
""If you have any information about McOure whereabouts, no matter how little, please reach out through our social media handles. Every detail matters, and your call could be the missing piece to finding him.""
Kaskazini spoke to Al Jazeera in Nairobi on Thursday, confirming that he had been released in the morning.
""I currently can't speak on that (police detention); I haven't processed it. I just got home this morning and I have left my family distraught in the house and I was telling them that I need to go to the ground because if I said on social media that we should not advance to the protected areas they would think that I have been bought off; I have not been bought off,"" he said.
""We are willing to risk our life for the country but it is a bloodbath. I've come to the streets to tell Kenyans that I am still with them. I have not eaten or showered. I have just changed my clothes and I have come to the streets.""

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/dutch-seek-to-reignite-will-to-win-against-euros-underdogs-romania-n344988,"Dutch seek to reignite 'will to win' against Euros underdogs Romania
Netherlands captain Virgil van Dijk has called
upon his side to rediscover their ""will to win"" ahead of Tuesday's
Euro 2024 last 16 meeting with Romania.
Despite boasting a talented squad, the
Netherlands have so far struggled in the tournament.
Drawn in Group D alongside heavyweights France
and Ralf Rangnick's impressive Austria, the Netherlands finished just ahead of
a lacklustre Poland and qualified as one of the four best third-placed sides.
Van Dijk, in particular, was the target of
criticism from former Dutch midfielder Rafael van der Vaart who slammed his
""disgraceful performance"" against Austria in the Netherlands' final
group game.
""I want him to show some passion,""
said the former Oranje playmaker.
Still considered among the best defenders in the
world, 32-year-old Van Dijk was at fault for Austria's decisive third goal in
the 3-2 win which sent the Alpine nation through as group winners.
""I know I can do better and it should be better,""
admitted Van Dijk, but the Dutch captain was far from alone in bearing
responsibility for the loss, with Memphis Depay and Donyell Malen missing
several chances.
In the last 16, the Netherlands will face
Romania, who surprisingly topped the closely-contested Group E thanks largely
to their opening round 3-0 thumping of Ukraine, while they drew and lost their
remaining matches.
The Dutch will need to improve should they wish
to reach the quarter-finals of the Euros for the first time since 2008, let
alone emulate the 1988 Oranje side and win a European Championship on German
soil.
With a win, a loss and a draw from three games,
the Dutch have come under fire -- criticism which Van Dijk
""completely understands"".
""Things overall can and should be
better,"" the Liverpool defender said after a 3-2 defeat to Austria, adding
""maybe we've been overestimating ourselves"".
But of particular concern was Van Dijk's
assessment of the team's attitude at the tournament.
""A lot had to be said and we had to analyse
a lot.
""It was not the tactics where things went
wrong. It was mainly the will to win, so we have talked about that -- and with
harsh words,"" added Van Dijk.
With a population less than a fifth the size of
neighbouring Germany, the Netherlands may struggle to consistently compete
among the European elite, but a knock on their desire is a damning assessment
for the proud football nation.
The criticism has not just come from outside,
with coach Ronald Koeman regularly airing his grievances with the players
publicly.
Koeman hooked Joey Veerman in the first half
against Austria for Xavi Simons, a player the coach has also criticised for not
working hard enough.
""I can list quite a few mistakes,""
Koeman said after the Austria game, adding ""we started badly in many
aspects"".
""There was a lack of pressure and we lost
the ball as well, particularly at the start. We were really very bad.""
Teams at major tournaments do not get much time
to work things out, but the Dutch will still be favoured to make it past
Romania, who had only won one of their 16 Euros matches prior to beating
Ukraine.
That win however came against one of Europe's
big guns: a 3-2 victory over England in 2000.
And the Dutch will be wary
of such an upset -- having a more recent reminder of the dangers of underdog
sides themselves, after they lost 2-0 to the Czech Republic at the last 16
stage of the Euros in 2021.

A section of residents in Nairobi’s Soweto are counting losses following a night fire.
Locals who spoke to Citizen Digital said that the fire broke out due to an electric fault.
“The fire destroyed quite a number of structures rendering dozens of people homeless,” a resident said.
The inferno, which started from one of the units, spread like bushfire even as locals anxiously waited for a fire engine.
Further, residents added that the situation was compounded by a poor road network.
“Accessibility to this area is another issue. Had the roads been better, the situation would have been different,” Stanley Mutiso said.
Several people were injured during the incident as locals dashed to their houses to salvage the little they could.
Police have launched investigations into the incident.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/call-for-professionalised-grassroots-climate-action-as-kenya-hosts-climate-justice-symposium-n344774,"Call for professionalised grassroots climate action as Kenya hosts climate justice symposium
Kenya’s grassroots green financing program
is at the defining phase for locals to prove their strategies in implementing
projects to sustain them within their localities from the biting climate change
effects.
The Treasury subsidiary office handling the
Financing Locally Led Climate Action (FLLoCA) program attests to witnessing the
climate change knowledge gap at various stages of the program in all 47
counties.
According to climate action experts in
Kenya, the county implementation units need to be impacted and guided through
the processes more often as well as the locals who are at the forefront of
implementing climate action projects, in a bid to ensure yields.
As Kenya is playing host for two weeks, to
the fourth International Symposium on Climate Justice which is entering a close
to the first week the knowledge gap factor is on the radar to facilitate an increase
in climate change action professionals in the villages.
The annual ‘green’ school dubbed ‘Nairobi
Summer School’ is hosted at Chuka University in Tharaka-Nithi County in
partnership with climate change organisations and other local universities.
The Financing Locally-Led Climate Action
(FLLoCA) program has invested in 98 students from all 47 counties to benefit from
the training and boost local understanding of the climate change action
narrative among the youthful generation.
“We decided to introduce the academic
empowerment to youth strategy to locals because the major challenge to FLLoCA
in the counties right now is the climate change technical knowhow; most staff
in those climate change units are handpicked not on academic qualification
basis but just for the sake of keeping the units running,” said Peter Odhengo,
the FLLoCA program coordinator.
The competitive climate change scholarship
program dubbed Nairobi Summer School saw over 4,000 applications
internationally yet only 280 scholars got the chance for the scholarship.
The rigorous selection process focused on
academic qualifications with a minimum of a bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree
at the highest academic qualification level in any field of study strictly
landing on youth of 35 years of age and below.
According to Mr Odhengo, the 98 Kenya youth
attending the fortnight program will be taken further for yet another private
climate change training in the country before they are posted for 6 months
attachment in their counties of origin Climate Change Units with a possible
employment recommendation after the attachment period to enhance local
operations in climate action at the county levels.
“Having people with basic and professional
knowledge in the County Climate Action offices will tighten loose ends and
provide readily available support to the locals who are the Climate Action
projects implementers, currently some counties are finding it rough for lack of
climate change technical knowledge,” he said.
“But the good thing is that we have FLLoCA
representatives on the ground walking the journey with the county governments
and the locals, the Climate change-trained youth will be the counties’
technical experts.”
The annual climate change symposium has 82
African countries' representation as well as 52 other countries' representation
globally.
However, the group of 98 trainees by FLLoCA
has been inaugural since the rollout of the grassroots Action green finance in 2024.
According to the program officials, the
scholarship program is expected to run every financial year.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/hurricane-beryl-heads-for-cayman-islands-mexico-after-striking-jamaica-n345237,"Hurricane Beryl heads for Cayman Islands, Mexico after striking Jamaica
Hurricane Beryl rumbled towards the Cayman Islands and Mexico on Thursday, after pummeling Jamaica with winds and rain that caused floods and widespread power outages and leaving a deadly trail of destruction in several smaller Caribbean islands.
Beryl has so far left at least 10 people dead but that number was widely expected to rise as communications are restored on islands devastated by flooding and powerful winds.
Beryl's eyewall skirted Jamaica's southern coast, pummeling communities as a powerful Category 4 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, as emergency workers evacuated people from flood-prone areas.
""It's terrible. Everything's gone. I'm in my house and scared,"" said Amoy Wellington, a 51-year-old cashier who lives in Top Hill, a rural farming community in southern St. Elizabeth parish. ""It's a disaster.""
Beryl moved away from Jamaica early on Thursday. At around 1200 GMT, the Category 3 hurricane was 80 kilometers from Grand Cayman and about 385 miles (620 km) off Tulum, Mexico, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.
Beryl was carrying top winds of 209 kph, and was expected to dump 10-15 cm of rain on the Cayman Islands, where life-threatening surf and rip currents were possible, the NHC said.
A hurricane warning was in force for the Cayman Islands east coast of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula.
Mexico's tourist centres of Cancun and the wider Yucatan peninsula lie in Beryl's predicted path. Cancun's airport was thronged with tourists hoping to catch last flights out before the storm arrives.
Workers filled bags with sand and boarded up doors and windows of businesses for protection.
Mexico's defense ministry opened around 120 storm shelters, and asked visitors to heed instructions on evacuation or other measures.
Beryl is the 2024 Atlantic season's first hurricane and at its peak earlier this week was the earliest Category 5 storm on record. A Category 5 hurricane brings winds of 252 kph or higher, capable of causing catastrophic damage including the destruction of homes and infrastructure.
In Jamaica the island's main airports were closed and streets were mostly empty after Prime Minister Andrew Holness issued a curfew for Wednesday, which was extended to Thursday as storm conditions continued. At least one person was reported killed in the storm.
Nearly 1,000 people were in shelters by Wednesday evening, Richard Thompson, acting director general at Jamaica's disaster agency said in an interview on local news.
The storm hit St. Vincent and the Grenadines earlier in the week. Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves said in a radio interview that Union Island was ""flattened"" and it would ""be a Herculean effort to rebuild.""
There were at least three confirmed fatalities and crop damage was widespread, senior officials told Reuters. Union Island suffered destruction of more than 90% of buildings.
In Grenada, Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell described ""Armageddon-like"" conditions after the storm made impact earlier in the week, with no power and widespread destruction, while also confirming three deaths.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro told state television that three people had died, four were missing, and over 8,000 homes damaged.
The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has forecast a large number of major hurricanes in an ""extraordinary"" season this year. The season runs from the start of June to the end of November
Beryl's destructive power, coming so early in the hurricane season, underscores the consequences of a warmer Atlantic Ocean, which scientists cite as a sign of human-caused climate change fueling extreme weather.

President William Ruto has formed an independent taskforce to carry out a comprehensive audit of the country’s public debt.
The President,
addressing the state on Friday, noted that the taskforce will be required to
provide a detailed report within the next three months.
He explained
that the report would be critical in providing transparent information to the
public and assess how public resources have been spent over time.
Ruto also
noted that the audit would provide solutions to how the government would manage
resources in a sustainable manner that will not burden future generations.
“I have today
appointed an independent taskforce to carry out comprehensive, forensic audit
of our public debt and report to us in the next three months,” he said.
“This audit
will provide people with clarity on the nature of our debt, how public
resources have been spent and proposal for managing our resources in a
sustainable manner that does not burden future generations.”
He also
announced further austerity measures, pointing out that the government would
reduce the budget by Ksh.177 billion and borrow Ksh.169 billion in a bid to
make up for the Ksh.346 billion lost by the withdrawal of the contentious
Finance Bill, 2024.
“Whatever we
will borrow will increase our fiscal deficit from 3.3 per cent of GDP to 4.6
per cent of GDP, still lower than last year and will be used to fund some of our
critical government services,” said the President.
As of
February 2024, the country’s public debt stood at Ksh.11.14 trillion, a figure
which was attributed to external loans, exchange rate fluctuations and uptake
of domestic debt over time.
The
country’s external debt increased by Ksh.1.4 trillion from January 2023 to
December 2023, while the domestic debt increased by Ksh.514 billion.
In retrospect, the country’s external debt
dominated the increase in total public debt, accounting for 73 per cent of the
total public debt.

President William Ruto has outlined a revised
fiscal strategy aimed at addressing revenue deficits in the 2023/24 national
budget, triggered by the withdrawal of the contentious Finance Bill, 2024.
In an address to the nation at State House,
Nairobi on Friday, Ruto highlighted that the Bill's withdrawal had left a
Ksh.346 billion deficit in the budget, further emphasizing the need for
decisive action to manage the shortfall.
""The consequence of withdrawing the
Finance Bill is the reduction of our revenue targets by Ksh.346 billion. Over
the last few days, our Treasury team has been assessing the adverse impact of
either reducing the budget by Ksh.346 billion in full or borrowing the amount
in full,"" he said.
According to the President, discarding the
full amount from the budget is not feasible as it would significantly affect
the delivery of essential government services, while borrowing the amount, in
its entirety, will also occasion a fiscal deficit that will have considerable
repercussions on many sectors including exchange and interest rates.
""We have since, after extensive
consultations, struck a middle ground and we will be proposing to the National
Assembly a budget cut of Ksh.177 billion and borrowing the difference,"" he
said.
""Whatever we are going to borrow will
increase our fiscal deficit from what I intended to be 3.3 per cent of our GDP,
to 4.6 percent of GDP, which is still lower than last year.""
The borrowed amount, Ruto added, will be
allocated strategically to safeguard crucial government initiatives.
""They include hiring of JSS teachers,
medical interns, funding the milk stabilisation process for our dairy farmers,
reviving our stalled road projects in many parts of Kenya, retaining the
fertiliser subsidy programme, capitalising the coffee cherry fund to support
farmers in that sector, enabling public owned sugar mills to pay outstanding
debt to sugarcane farmers for their deliveries,"" he said.
""The additional funding for the higher
education new funding model that was in our plan will now receive additional
funding, settling arrears owed to counties, settling arrears for NG-CDF and
setting arrears for our pension.""

(Photo by Arun SANKAR / AFP)
Survivors of India's deadliest stampede in over a decade on Wednesday recalled the horror of being crushed at a vastly overcrowded Hindu religious gathering that left 121 people dead.
A police report said more than 250,000 people attended the event in northern India's Uttar Pradesh state, more than triple the 80,000 organisers had permission for.
On Wednesday morning, hours after the event, discarded clothing and lost shoes were scattered across the muddy site, an open field alongside a highway.
People fell on top of each other as they tumbled down a slope into a water-logged ditch, witnesses said.
""Everyone –- the entire crowd, including women and children –- all left from the event site at once,"" said police officer Sheela Maurya, 50, who had been on duty Tuesday as a popular Hindu preacher delivered a sermon.
""There wasn't enough space, and everyone just fell on top of each other.""
Almost all of the dead were women, along with seven children killed and one man.
Officials suggested the stampede was triggered when worshippers tried to gather soil from the footsteps of the preacher, while others blamed a dust storm for sparking panic.
Some fainted from the force of the crowd, before falling and being trampled upon, unable to move.
The Uttar Pradesh's state disaster management centre, the Office of the Relief Commissioner, released a list of the dead on Wednesday morning.
It said 121 people had been killed.
Maurya, who had been on duty since early morning on Tuesday in the sweltering humid heat at the preacher's ceremony, was among the injured.
""I tried to help some women, but even I fainted and was crushed under the crowd,"" she told AFP.
""I don't know, but someone pulled me out, and I don't remember much.""
Deadly incidents are common at places of worship during major religious festivals in India, the biggest of which prompt millions of devotees to make pilgrimages to holy sites.
""The main highway next to the field was packed with people and vehicles for kilometres, there were far too many people here,"" said Hori Lal, 45, who lives in Phulrai Mughalgadi village, near the site of the stampede.
""Once people started falling to the side and getting crushed, there was just chaos.""
Chaitra V., divisional commissioner of Aligarh city in Uttar Pradesh state, initially said panic began when ""attendees were exiting the venue when a dust storm blinded their vision, leading to a melee"".
But Uttar Pradesh Chief Secretary Manoj Kumar Singh told reporters after visiting the site that worshippers had scrambled to get close to the preacher.
""I am told that people rushed to touch his feet and tried to collect soil, and a stampede took place,"" Singh said, according to the Indian Express daily.
""Many people fell in a nearby drain"".
Maurya said she had worked at several political rallies and large events in the past but had ""never seen such huge numbers"".
""It was very hot, even I fell there and I survived with great difficulty"", she added.
At dawn on Wednesday, four unidentified bodies lay on the floor of a makeshift morgue at the hospital in the nearby town of Hathras.
Ram Nivas, 35, a farmer, said he was searching for his sister-in-law Rumla, 54, who was missing after the crush.
""We haven't been able to find her anywhere,"" Nivas said, adding he had visited all the nearby hospitals throughout the night.
""We just hope she's still alive,"" he said quietly. ""Maybe just lost.""
In the hospital's emergency ward, Sandeep Kumar, 29, sat next to his injured sister, Shikha Kumar, 22.
""After the event ended, everyone wanted to exit quickly, and that is what led to the stampede,"" Sandeep said.
""She saw people fainting, getting crushed.""
Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced compensation of $2,400 to the next of kin of those who died and $600 to those injured in the ""tragic incident"".
President Droupadi Murmu said the deaths were ""heart-rending"" and offered her ""deepest condolences"".
Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who is also a Hindu monk, expressed his condolences to the relatives of those killed and ordered an investigation into the deaths, his office said.
Religious gatherings in India have a grim track record of deadly incidents caused by poor crowd management and safety lapses.

Published on: July 10, 2024 10:46 (EAT)

France boast an enviable record in major tournaments over the last decade under Didier Deschamps and have no plans to change coach despite a disappointing campaign at Euro 2024.
Tuesday's 2-1 defeat against Spain in Munich ended France's hopes of reaching a fourth final in the last five tournaments, European Championships and World Cups combined.
Reaching the semi-finals allowed Deschamps to meet the minimum target set for him in Germany, which is why French Football Federation president Philippe Diallo insisted the coach would see out his contract, which runs until 2026.
""I see no reason to call into question his contract,"" Diallo told sports daily L'Equipe on Wednesday.
""Past results speak for him and he has fulfilled his objectives. Didier will stay on.""
The manner of France's Euros exit was deeply underwhelming, however.
They simply never caught fire, with Randal Kolo Muani's early goal to give them the lead against Spain the only one scored in open play by any of their players in six matches in Germany.
""Despite reaching the last four, France go out of the Euros with a bitter taste,"" was how L'Equipe summed up their campaign.
Few teams boast a squad as strong as that of Deschamps, but while his side defended superbly for most of the Euros, their attackers failed to sparkle.
Kylian Mbappe, handicapped by fitness problems, was a shadow of his usual self, while Antoine Griezmann never came close to the form he showed at the 2022 World Cup and ended up being dropped.
""My ambition was to be champion of Europe and have a good Euros, and I have not done one thing or the other,"" said Mbappe, whose only goal in Germany was a penalty against Poland.
France have got used to winning under Deschamps, but winning is all that has ever mattered to the coach, who is less fussed about playing with panache than about getting results.
""If you are bored you can watch something else. You are not obliged to watch us,"" Deschamps replied to one question by a Swedish journalist suggesting France were boring.
Those accusations have been levelled at Deschamps in the past, but not always fairly until this year.
His record does speak for itself, with Deschamps having taken over a team at a low ebb in 2012.
The captain of the France sides that won the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000, he led them to the quarter-finals of the 2014 World Cup, his first tournament in charge.
They then reached the Euro 2016 final and won the 2018 World Cup before losing the 2022 World Cup final on penalties to Argentina.
France also won the UEFA Nations League in 2021 and their only truly below-par showing at a recent major tournament came at the last Euros, when they lost on penalties to Switzerland in the last 16.
It was following the last World Cup that Deschamps signed a contract extension until 2026, and that year's World Cup is now France's next big objective.
But it remains to be seen whether Deschamps, 55, is still the man to lead them forward after six major tournaments in charge.
It is worth citing the example of Joachim Loew, who became Germany coach in 2006.
In Loew's first five tournaments, Germany won the 2014 World Cup, got to the Euro 2008 final, and lost three semi-finals.
After that, Germany went out of the 2018 World Cup in the group stage, and a last-16 exit at Euro 2020 -- his seventh major tournament -- signalled the end.
Deschamps refused to answer a question about his future after the Spain defeat.
If he does now stay, Zinedine Zidane -- often cited in the past as a possible successor -- will have to keep waiting for his chance.
Meanwhile Euro 2024 marks the end of the road for veteran striker Olivier Giroud, France's all-time top scorer, but there is no suggestion that Griezmann, aged 33, plans to retire.
""We will come back. We have talent but you need a lot more than that,"" Griezmann said on Tuesday, acknowledging France had not performed well enough in Germany.
They always have new stars emerging, and Paris Saint-Germain winger Bradley Barcola, just 21, has been a revelation.
Most importantly, regardless of Deschamps' own situation, France will hope to get Mbappe back on form and fully fit for their next games, against Italy and Belgium in the Nations League in September.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/french-voters-deliver-a-win-for-the-left-a-blow-for-le-pen-and-a-hung-parliament-n345411,"French voters deliver a win for the left, a blow for Le Pen and a hung parliament
Voters delivered a major setback for Marine Le Pen's nationalist, eurosceptic National Rally (RN), which opinion polls had predicted would win the second-round ballot but ended up in the third spot, according to pollsters' projections.
The results were also a blow for centrist President Emmanuel Macron, who called the snap election to clarify the political landscape after his ticket took a battering at the hands of the RN in European Parliament elections last month.
He ended up with a hugely fragmented parliament, in what is set to weaken France's role in the European Union and elsewhere abroad and make it hard for anyone to push through a domestic agenda.
The election will leave parliament divided in three big groups - the left, centrists, and the far right - with hugely different platforms and no tradition at all of working together.
What comes next is uncertain.
The leftist New Popular Front (NFP) alliance, which wants to cap prices of essential goods like fuel and food, raise the minimum wage to a net 1,600 euros ($1,732) per month, hike wages for public sector workers and impose a wealth tax, immediately said it wanted to govern.
""The will of the people must be strictly respected ... the president must invite the New Popular Front to govern,"" said hard-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon.
The RN has worked under Le Pen to shed a historic reputation for racism and antisemitism but many in French society still view its France-first stance and surging popularity with alarm.
There were hugs, screams of joy and tears of relief at the left's gathering in Paris when the voting projections were announced.
Republique square in central Paris filled with crowds and a party atmosphere, with leftwing supporters playing drums, lighting flares, and chanting ""We’ve won! We’ve won!""
""I'm relieved. As a French-Moroccan, a doctor, an ecologist activist, what the far right was proposing to do as a government was craziness,"" said 34-year-old Hafsah Hachad.
The awkward leftist alliance, which the hard left, Greens and Socialists hastily put together before the vote, was far from having an absolute majority of 289 seats in the 577-seat assembly.
Official results were trickling in, with the results from most, if not all, constituencies likely in the early hours of Monday. Polling agencies - which are generally accurate - forecast the left would get 184-198 seats, Macron's centrist alliance 160-169 and the RN and its allies 135-143.
The euro fell on Sunday after the vote projections were announced.
""We should get a brief respite in the market ... because we're not seeing an extremist RN majority take place, but it's likely to lead to political gridlock at least until the autumn of 2025,"" said Aneeka Gupta, macroeconomic research director at WisdomTree.
Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said he would hand in his resignation on Monday but would stay on in a care-taking capacity as long as needed.
'DIVIDED'
A key question is whether the leftist alliance will stay united and agree on what course to take.
Melenchon, leader of the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI), ruled out a broad coalition of parties of different stripes.
Raphael Glucksmann, from the Socialist Party, urged his alliance partners to act like ""grown-ups.""
""We're ahead, but we're in a divided parliament,"" he said. ""We're going to have to talk, to discuss, to engage in dialogue.""
The constitution does not oblige Macron to ask the leftist group to form a government, though that would be the usual step as it is the biggest group in parliament.
In Macron's entourage, there was no indication of his next move.
""The question we're going to have to ask ourselves tonight and in the coming days is: which coalition is capable of reaching the 289 seats to govern?"", one person close to him told Reuters.
Some in his alliance, including former Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, envisaged a broad cross-party alliance but said it could not include the far-left France Unbowed.
RN DISAPPOINTMENT
For the RN, the result was a far cry from weeks during which opinion polls consistently projected it would win comfortably.
The left and centrist alliances cooperated after the first round of voting last week by pulling scores of candidates from three-way races to build a unified anti-RN vote.
In his first reaction, RN leader Jordan Bardella called the cooperation between anti-RN forces a ""disgraceful alliance"" that he said would paralyze France.
Le Pen, who will be the party's candidate for the 2027 presidential election, said however that Sunday's ballot, in which the RN made major gains compared with previous elections, had sown the seeds for the future.
""Our victory has been merely delayed,"" she said.
Voters punished Macron and his ruling alliance for a cost of living crisis and failing public services, as well as over immigration and security.
Le Pen and her party tapped into those grievances, spreading their appeal way beyond their traditional strongholds along the Mediterranean coast and in the country's northern rust belt, but it was not enough to win power.

This is according to a communiqué from the State House's Press Secretary, Emmanuel Talam.
The address follows a day of protest that left two dead and more than 125 people with injuries.
Kenyan protesters broke through parliament barricades on Tuesday and entered the complex, where lawmakers were debating contentious tax hike proposals that have sparked widespread outrage.
According to Amnesty International Kenya, hundreds of protesters broke through police barriers outside parliament in Nairobi, with police firing live rounds and injuring ""many"" people.
A section of parliament that houses offices was also set on fire as protesters stormed the buildings, accompanied by heavy gunfire from police officers battling the defiant mob.
Protesters who have rallied against the contentious Bill, which was passed by the House on Tuesday, have been picketing for the past week, arguing that if passed, the Bill will burden an already burdened population.
The United States of America, the United Kingdom and a host of other countries have condemned the abduction and killing of protesters in Kenya during the ongoing anti-Finance Bill protests that have been witnessed across the country.
In a joint statement, Ambassadors & High Commissioners from 13 countries expressed concern over the violence witnessed across the country and the resultant deaths.
""We are deeply concerned by the violence witnessed in many parts of the country during the recent protests, and are especially shocked by the scenes witnessed outside the Kenyan Parliament,"" reads the statement.

World number one Jannik Sinner takes on Italian compatriot and former runner-up Matteo Berrettini for a place in the Wimbledon third round on Wednesday.
Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz and four-time major winner Naomi Osaka also target places in the last 32.
Alcaraz faces a man who once defeated him in a Grand Slam qualifier while Osaka's rival is the daughter of an American billionaire.
AFP Sport looks at three matches to watch on day three of the tournament:
Sinner faces all-Italian duel with Berrettini
Italian men's tennis has rarely been stronger, with the country boasting five players in the top 50 while the nation swept to Davis Cup glory last season.
Ten Italian men started the singles tournament this year at Wimbledon.
Jannik Sinner was the first Italian man to capture a Grand Slam title with his victory at the Australian Open in January and was also the first from his country to become world number one.
Matteo Berrettini can boast his own breakthrough Italian moment when he was the first to make a Wimbledon men's final in 2021, where his run was ended by Novak Djokovic.
Sinner, who made the semi-finals at the All England Club last year, defeated Berrettini in their only previous meeting at the Masters-level event in Canada last year.
""I think his secret is that he is really hungry for improvement. That's his secret. And the humbleness that he has about it. He's just special,"" said Berrettini of his compatriot.
Alcaraz eyes revenge for rare defeat
Third-ranked Carlos Alcaraz is bidding to become just the sixth man after Rod Laver, Bjorn Borg, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic to win the French Open and Wimbledon titles back to back.
He defeated dreadlocked Estonian qualifier Mark Lajal in the first round on Monday as he started his bid for a fourth Grand Slam title after adding last year's Wimbledon to his 2022 US Open breakthrough.
Aleksandar Vukic enjoyed an impressive run to the semi-finals of the Eastbourne grass-court tournament last week after only making the main draw as a lucky loser from qualifying.
The 28-year-old Australian, ranked at 69 in the world, was born in Sydney after his parents fled Montenegro during the break-up of Yugoslavia in the 1990s.
He booked his date with Alcaraz the hard way, saving a match point in a five-set triumph over Sebastian Ofner, facing down 24 aces and 72 winners from the Austrian.
Vukic can boast one career win over Alcaraz -- he came out on top against the then 17-year-old Spaniard in the first round of qualifying for the 2020 French Open.
Osaka seeks stress-free day on grass
Four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka defeated Diane Parry of France in the first round to register her first win at Wimbledon since 2018.
Former world number one Osaka, still feeling her way back on tour after giving birth to daughter Shai last July, fired 34 winners past Parry on a surface that should be the perfect fit for her powerful game.
""It felt really fun and really stressful at the same time,"" said 113th-ranked Osaka, whose last appearance at Wimbledon in 2019 had ended in a first round exit.
On Wednesday, the Japanese star takes on America's 17th-ranked Emma Navarro, who arrived in London on the back of a semi-final run at the Bad Homburg grass-court tournament.
Navarro has high achievement in the genes -- her father Ben Navarro is a former vice-president of banking giant Citigroup.
Forbes recently estimated his worth at $1.5 billion.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/who-is-masoud-pezeshkian-irans-new-president-elect-n345313,"Who is Masoud Pezeshkian, Iran's new president-elect?
Iran's president-elect, low-profile moderate Masoud Pezeshkian, carries the hopes of millions of Iranians seeking less restrictions on social freedoms and a more pragmatic foreign policy.
Pezeshkian, who defeated hardline Saeed Jalili in Friday's second-round presidential vote, is someone world powers are likely to welcome, hoping he might pursue peaceful ways out of a tense standoff with Iran over its fast-advancing nuclear programme, analysts said.
Pezeshkian managed to win with a constituency - whose core was believed to be the urban middle class and young - that had been widely disillusioned by years of security crackdowns that stifled any public dissent from Islamist orthodoxy.
The 69-year-old cardiac surgeon has pledged to promote a pragmatic foreign policy, ease tensions over now-stalled negotiations with major powers to revive a 2015 nuclear pact and improve prospects for social liberalisation and political pluralism.
Under Iran's dual system of clerical and republican rule, the president cannot usher in any major policy shift on Iran's nuclear programme or support for militia groups across the Middle East, since Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei calls all the shots on top state matters.
However, the president can influence the tone of Iran's policy and he will be closely involved in selecting the successor to Khamenei, now 85.
Pezeshkian is faithful to Iran's theocratic rule with no intention of confronting the powerful security hawks and clerical rulers. In TV debates and interviews, he has promised not to contest Khamenei's policies.
""If I try but fail to fulfil my campaign promises, I would say goodbye to political work and not continue. There is no point in wasting our life and not being able to serve our dear people,"" Pezeshkian said in a video message to voters.
Resurfaced from quiescence after years of political isolation, the reformist camp led by former President Mohammad Khatami endorsed Pezeshkian in the election after the death of hardline President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash in May.
Pezeshkian's views offer a contrast to those of Raisi, a Khamenei protege who tightened enforcement of a law curbing women's dress and took a tough stance in now-moribund negotiations with major powers to revive the nuclear deal.
In 2018, then-U.S. President Donald Trump ditched the pact and reimposed sanctions on Iran. His move prompted Tehran to progressively violate the agreement's nuclear limits.
Pezeshkian has vowed to revive the flagging economy, beset by mismanagement, state corruption and U.S. sanctions.
As the powers of the elected president are circumscribed by those of Khamenei, many Iranians keen for political pluralism at home and an end to Iran's isolation abroad doubt the country's ruling theocracy would let Pezeshkian make major changes even if he tried.
""Pezeshkian might be able to bring some social freedoms. But he will be a weak president because Khamenei and his allies are much more powerful than the president,"" said Sohrab Hosseini, a 45-year-old businessman in Iran's Kish Island.
""I voted for him to prevent Jalili from winning.""
As a lawmaker since 2008, Pezeshkian, an Azeri who supports the rights of fellow ethnic minorities, has criticised the clerical establishment's suppression of political and social dissent.
In 2022, Pezeshkian demanded clarification from authorities about the death of Mahsa Amini, a woman who died in custody after she was arrested for allegedly violating a law restricting women's dress. Her death sparked months of unrest across the country.
""We will respect the hijab law, but there should never be any intrusive or inhumane behaviour toward women,"" Pezeshkian said after casting his vote in the first round.
At a Tehran University meeting last month, responding to a question about students imprisoned on charges linked to 2022-23 unrest, Pezeshkian said ""political prisoners are not within my scope, and if I want to do something, I have no authority"".
During the Iran-Iraq war in 1980s, Pezeshkian, a combatant and physician, was tasked with the deployment of medical teams to the front lines.
He was health minister from 2001-5 in Khatami's second term.
Pezeshkian lost his wife and one of his children in a car accident in 1994. He raised his surviving two sons and a daughter alone, opting to never remarry.

https://www.citizen.digital/business/finance-bill-turmoil-complicates-imf-cash-could-boost-borrowing-costs-n344924,"Finance Bill turmoil complicates IMF cash, could boost borrowing costs
The bill included unpopular levies on bread, vegetable oil and sugar, mobile money transfers and some imports.
It had been meant to raise 346 billion Kenyan shillings ($2.68 billion), or 3% of GDP, in additional revenue, Morgan Stanley's Neville Z. Mandimika wrote in a note.
Its withdrawal ""will likely result in Kenya missing the 4.7% fiscal deficit target this year and 3.5% target next year as per the IMF programme,"" he said.
The IMF did not immediately comment on whether it would shift Kenya's required targets.
""Our main goal in supporting Kenya is to help it overcome the difficult economic challenges it faces and improve its economic prospects and the well-being of its people,"" IMF spokesperson Julie Kozack said in a statement.
Kenya agreed a four-year loan with the IMF in 2021, and signed on for additional lending to support climate change measures in May 2023, taking its total IMF loan access to $3.6 billion.
The IMF requires regular reviews of reforms - in Kenya's case every six months - before it releases tranches of funding.
Kenya reached a staff level agreement with the IMF earlier this month on a seventh review - before President William Ruto abandoned the tax bill on Wednesday - even then warning of revenue shortfalls. The review in theory paves the way for $976 million, but it had not secured crucial IMF board sign-off.
""There isn't a great deal of room to manoeuvre unless you really start doing much more thorough reviews"" of spending, said Giulia Pelligrini, senior portfolio manager with Allianz Global Investors, of what Kenya can do to meet targets. ""So it's going to be difficult.""
She added that a mix of government spending cuts, and flexibility from the IMF on programme targets, was the likely outcome.
Kenya's sovereign dollar bonds slid after Ruto's u-turn. Morgan Stanley said that with eurobond yields back above 10%, Kenya had limited access to international bonds, which could push them to borrow more locally.
""The next catalyst for spreads would be statements from the IMF on how the programme will be recalibrated to reflect this new reality,"" Mandimika wrote.
JPMorgan's Sthembiso E. Nkalanga and Gbolahan S. Taiwo said they expected the IMF to sign off on the seventh review, but Ruto had painful choices ahead.
""Fiscal consolidation efforts now shift towards spending cuts,"" they wrote in a note.
JPMorgan added it does not expect Kenya's Central Bank to cut interest rates until December after the central bank added a likely ""higher-for-longer"" stance in its risks assessment in May.
This, along with a lack of international market access, will put pressure on domestic borrowing, elevating costs. Moody's credit rating agency also warned of upward pressure on domestic borrowing costs.
Paul Greer, portfolio manager with Fidelity, said the turmoil was a reminder that moving too quickly on reforms can backfire.
""It's just an illustration of the limitations of fiscal austerity,"" he told Reuters. ""Clearly, this was a step too far.""

https://www.citizen.digital/news/kenyas-finance-bill-why-has-it-triggered-protests-n344628,"Kenya's finance bill: Why has it triggered protests?
Published on: June 25, 2024 10:32 (EAT)
Youth-led protests against the Kenyan government's plans to raise revenue through additional taxes are expected to intensify on Tuesday when lawmakers vote on proposed amendments to the bill.
At least two persons have been killed and more than 200 injured since protests against the finance bill swept the country earlier this month.
Here are some details about the tax proposals:
WHY THE FINANCE BILL?
A finance bill is usually presented to parliament before the start of a financial year that runs from July to June, laying out the government's fiscal plans.
In the 2024/25 bill, the Kenyan government aims to raise $2.7 billion in additional taxes to reduce the budget deficit and state borrowing. Kenya's public debt stands at 68% of GDP, higher than the 55% of GDP recommended by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
Grappling with acute liquidity challenges amid uncertainty over its ability to access capital from financial markets, Kenya has turned to the IMF - which has urged the government to meet revenue targets to access more funding.
Protesters want the government to abandon the planned tax hikes, which they argue will choke the economy and raise the cost of living for Kenyans who are already struggling to make ends meet.
This is not the first time a finance bill has met with resistance from some citizens.
The government of President William Ruto, who was elected in 2022 on a pledge to uplift lives of the poor, last year used the bill to introduce a housing tax and to raise the top personal income tax rate, sparking anger, street protests and court challenges.
WHAT ARE THE PROPOSED TAX MEASURES?
The proposed measures that have triggered protests include new levies on basic commodities like bread, vegetable oil and sugar and a new motor vehicle circulation tax - pegged at 2.5% of the value of a car to be paid annually.
An ""eco levy"" on most manufactured goods including sanitary towels and diapers is also on the cards. In addition to the new taxes, the bill proposes increasing existing taxes on financial transactions.
The government has said the tax measures are necessary to fund development programmes and cut public debt.
Last week the government softened its position a little, with Ruto endorsing recommendations to scrap some of the new levies, including on car ownership, bread and the eco levy on locally manufactured goods.
The finance ministry has said such concessions would blow a 200 billion Kenyan shilling ($1.56 billion) hole in the 2024/25 budget and necessitate spending cuts.
Protesters and opposition parties have said the concessions are not enough and want the whole bill abandoned.
WHAT'S NEXT FOR THE BILL?
Parliament will meet on Tuesday to vote on the proposed amendments to the bill. Members of parliament will not discuss areas of the bill that are not subject to amendments.
Once passed by parliament, President Ruto would have to sign it into law within 14 days or send it back to parliament for further amendments.
WHAT ABOUT THE PROTESTS?
Ruto has acknowledged the youth-led protests and pledged to hold dialogue to address their concerns. It is unclear when this will happen.
It is also unclear whether the protests will intensify should parliament pass the bill. The social media-driven protests lack clear leadership structures, but many young people have pledged to keep demonstrating.
Some protesters have cited the arrest of at least two activists since Ruto's offer of talks on Sunday as evidence the government does not have any goodwill.
The government has said the withdrawal of some tax proposals shows its willingness to compromise.

Netherlands coach Ronald Koeman hammered his team for their performance in a 3-2 defeat by Austria at Euro 2024 on Tuesday that left them with third place in Group D.
Austria won the section ahead of France but the Netherlands were already guaranteed to qualify for the last 16, doing so as one of the four best third-place sides after crumbling in Berlin.
The Dutch beat Poland in their opening fixture before a goalless draw against tournament favourites France, but underwhelmed in the German capital against Ralf Rangnick's well-drilled outfit.
""The France match went reasonably well, taking into account the outcome, we played rather well as a team (but) today the performance was appalling,"" Koeman told reporters.
""People played poorly in certain aspects... we have to track our opponents and that's not what happened.""
Koeman said his team made a catalogue of errors against Austria, who took an early lead through Donyell Malen's own goal.
Cody Gakpo equalised and after Romano Schmid struck for Austria, Memphis Depay pulled the Dutch back level again, but Marcel Sabitzer then lashed home the winner in the 80th minute.
""I can list quite a few (mistakes),"" continued Koeman.
""We started very badly in many aspects. We did not defend well. There were many openings for the opponent.
""We were not aggressive. We lost the ball as well, particularly at the start. We were really very bad.""
Netherlands won the competition for their first and only time 36 years ago to the day in Germany at Euro 1988, but Koeman said his team had to improve to have another chance of glory.
""We need to find a response, we have to prepare for the next match,"" added Koeman.
""That could be the final knockout, we don't want that to be the case, but we will have to play better than we performed today (to avoid that).""
Koeman was visibly angry with the team's performance in the first half and substituted midfielder Joey Veerman after 35 minutes to try and shake up his team.
The PSV Eindhoven player, 25, appeared on the verge of tears as he watched the rest of the match from the bench.
""I had to intervene as coach after the first half an hour,"" explained Koeman.
""We gave away the ball a lot, and so did Joey, but I could have taken off more players.""
Koeman noted the first half display by the whole side was poor as Austria dominated the ball.
""We didn't have a lot of possession so it was very difficult, there was no rest in the game,"" he added.
""We were running like headless chickens. It was awful, very bad, we did not control the match.""

https://www.citizen.digital/news/deadly-strikes-in-gaza-as-israel-commits-to-talks-n345345,"Deadly strikes in Gaza as Israel commits to talks
The fighting raged as diplomatic efforts to halt the war, which will enter its tenth month on Sunday, continued with Israel saying on Friday it would send a delegation next week to continue talks with Qatari mediators.
In a statement announcing the move, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesman said ""gaps"" remained with Hamas on how to secure a ceasefire and hostage release deal.
That came after a delegation led by the head of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency, David Barnea, held a first round of talks with mediators in Doha.
""It was agreed that next week Israeli negotiators will travel to Doha to continue the talks. There are still gaps between the parties,"" the spokesman said.
There has been no truce since a one-week pause in November during which 80 Israeli hostages were freed in return for 240 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.
The war continued unabated on Saturday, with Israel's military saying it had conducted operations across much of the Gaza Strip, including Shujaiya in the north, Deir al-Balah in central Gaza and Rafah in the south.
Shujaiya is among the areas the military had previously declared to be cleared of Hamas, but where fighting is again taking place.
The health ministry in the Hamas-run territory said at least 87 people had been killed in the past 48 hours, and paramedics on Saturday reported 10 deaths in an air strike on a house in Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza.
The Hamas press office and paramedics said four journalists working for local media outlets were killed in strikes overnight, and the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said two of its employees had been killed.
According to UNRWA, which coordinated much of the aid delivered to Gaza, 194 of its employees have been killed in the war.
- 'Ball in Israel's court' -
The United States, which has mediated talks alongside Qatar and Egypt, has talked up the prospects of a deal saying there is a ""pretty significant opening"" for both sides.
US President Joe Biden announced a pathway to a truce deal in May that he said had been proposed by Israel.
This included an initial six-week truce, Israeli withdrawal from Gaza population centres and the freeing of hostages by Palestinian militants.
Talks subsequently stalled, but a US official said on Thursday that a new proposal from Hamas ""moves the process forward and may provide the basis for closing the deal"".
Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan told AFP that new ideas from the group had been ""conveyed by the mediators to the American side, which welcomed them and passed them on to the Israeli side. Now the ball is in the Israeli court.""
The war began with Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on southern Israel that resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.
The militants also seized hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza including 42 the military says are dead.
In response, Israel has carried out a military offensive that has killed at least 38,098 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory.
The war has uprooted 90 percent of Gaza's population, destroyed much of its housing and other infrastructure, and left almost 500,000 people enduring ""catastrophic"" hunger, UN agencies say.
The main stumbling block to a truce deal has been Hamas's demand for a permanent end to the fighting, which Netanyahu and his far-right coalition partners strongly reject.
The veteran hawk demands the release of the hostages but also insists the war will not end until Israel has destroyed Hamas's ability to make war or govern.
- Sirens and air strikes -
Cross-border fire between Israel and Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah movement has occurred almost daily since the Gaza war began, but has escalated notably over the past month.
That has raised fears of a major conflagration between the staunch enemies which could draw in Iran and other powers.
On Saturday morning, sirens blared over northern Israel and the military said it had downed a ""suspicious aerial target"" and two ""hostile aircraft"" launched from Lebanon fell in open ground.
The military said earlier it had attacked ""a number of Hezbollah terror targets in southern Lebanon"" overnight, all near the border.
US officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, have voiced hope that a ceasefire in Gaza could also lead to an easing of violence on the Israel-Lebanon border.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/i-have-no-advisors-duale-responds-to-plan-to-scrap-ministers-staff-n345654,"'I have no advisors,' Duale responds to plan to scrap ministers’ staff
In a circular dispatched to all CSs from Felix Koskei, Head of Public Service, the number of advisors assigned to each Cabinet Secretary was revised from two to one. Hence, all CSs were required to submit the name of the advisor to be retained by Thursday, July 11.
In response, Duale revealed that his ministry did not have advisors since all officials possessed the requisite training to provide strategic advice to his office.
""I have no advisers to submit as the men and women at the helm of Defense headquarters leadership have the required training, knowledge and experience to give me strategic advice and guidance to steer the Ministry,"" he said.
His remarks elicited debate online with Kenyans questioning whether the Head of Public Service had the required information on the staffing of President Ruto's cabinet. Others also criticised why the CS would share confidential information with the public. This is after the CS shared the letter and had the confidential tag on it.
Koskei had informed the CSs to fire one advisor and retain the other as part of the austerity measures to enhance fiscal discipline in the public service.
""Consequently, you are requested to assess the requirements of your office and indicate the advisor you would wish to retain to support you in discharge of your portfolio mandate. Any advisors beyond the set threshold will be immediately phased out from the Public Service,"" read part of the letter.
""Accordingly, and by way of this circular letter, you are directed to submit to the Public Service Commission the full name of the advisor to be retained, with a copy to this Office by the close of business on Thursday, July 11, 2024.""
Other austerity measures involved dissolving at least 47 state corporations with overlapping functions, suspending the hiring of Chief Administrative Secretaries, removal of budgets in the Offices of the First and Second Lady, reducing the budget for renovation in government by 50 per cent and suspending the purchase of new vehicles for one year except for security agencies.

Jubilee
Christian Church (JCC) founder Bishop Allan Kiuna has died at a Nairobi hospital while receiving treatment.
The 57-year-old reportedly passed on at around noon,
before his body was transferred to the Lee Funeral Home.
His
wife, Rev. Kathy Kiuna, in a lengthy Instagram post in 2019, revealed that he had
been diagnosed with Cancer the previous year.
Rev.
Kathy, at the time, noted that the chemotherapy treatment had caused Bishop
Kiuna to lose hair and gain weight.
Bishop
Kiuna in 2022 sought further treatment in the United States, where he ended up
spending a year, and on his return last year, announced that he had won the battle
against the disease.
During
a thanksgiving service held at his Nairobi church on December 10, 2023, he declared
himself Cancer-free, further revealing that his treatment cost over $3 million
(nearly Ksh.460 million, by then).
He,
however, went on to state that not a single coin out of this amount came from
his own pockets.
“For the one year that I was in the US, my treatment cost $3
million, and I didn’t remove one coin from my pocket because the God of heaven
provided. I did not call anyone,” he said then.
“Don’t get bitter with the process. If you get bitter with
the process, you shall abort your purpose. I am not bitter about the process
because I am better. My best days are ahead of me.”
The thanksgiving ceremony also marked Bishop Kiuna’s 57th
birthday, and his 29-year marriage anniversary to Rev. Kathy.

International tea suppliers James Finlay Limited
and Lipton Teas and Infusions have called for the immediate removal of John
Chebochok as Director of Toror Tea Factory, an industrial unit under the
management of the Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA).
In a letter penned by Group Corporate Affairs
Director Ben Woolf on Wednesday, Finlays referenced allegations of sexual
assault lodged against Chebochok following a February 2023 BBC Africa expose.
In the expose, Chebochok and one John Asava
were secretly filmed preying on women workers at Finlays' factory in Kericho in
exchange for employment.
Despite the allegations, Chebochok was last
week elected tea factory director in Kericho in an election presided over by
the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC).
""We are writing to request that you
immediately remove John Chebochok from his position as Director of Toror Tea
Factory, a KTDA factory,"" said Finlays in the letter addressed to senior
KTDA officials.
""As you know, as soon as Finlays became
aware of the allegations made against Mr. Chebochok in the BBC documentary of
February 2023, we terminated his contract with Finlays, barred him from
entering our property, and reported the allegations to the local and national
police.""
According to Finlays, although Chebochok was
not formally charged for the alleged offenses, the undercover footage and the
testimonies of survivors presented in the documentary cannot be disregarded.
""It is our strong view that it is untenable
for Mr. Chebochok to hold any position within the KTDA. Critically, allowing
Mr. Chebochok to hold a position of authority in the KTDA serves to counteract
the excellent work being done by many stakeholders across Kenya and globally to
tackle the issue of sexual and gender-based violence on tea farms,"" stated
the company.
""It also undermines our
customer/supplier relationship and puts the reputation of the KTDA and the
wider Kenyan tea industry, at risk. Please be aware that we will not be able to
continue to purchase tea from Toror Tea Factory while Mr. Chebochok holds the
role of Director.""
Finlays' sentiments were echoed by Lipton Tea
in a letter written by Chief Supply Chain Officer Bruno Laine and addressed to
Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Mithika Linturi.
""Chebochok was previously filmed
sexually harassing female workers in an undercover investigation broadcast by
the BBC in 2023 We respectfully urge the relevant authorities to reverse his
appointment and take necessary actions to ensure that such cases cannot occur
in the future,"" said Lipton.
""Allowing Chebochok, a figure central to serious allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse, to stand for and subsequently win election undermines President Ruto's ambition for Kenyan tea to be recognised worldwide as a mark of quality. It is Imperative that the tea sector in Kenya upholds the highest standards of ethics and social responsibility in the global market.""

President William Ruto has urged Kenyans to remain
calm and await the 2027 General Election to replace any elected leaders they feel
have slept on the job since assuming office post-August 2022.
Speaking when he commissioned the Kibuka Power sub station in Kajiado County on
Wednesday, President Ruto emphasised that leaders who fail to meet their people’s
expectations will be shown the door come 2027, whereas those who will
successfully fulfill their constitutional duties will earn extended terms in
office.
""Nataka tuelewe ya kwamba vile tunasonga
mbele ni kuhakikisha ya kwamba kila kiongozi; kila mmoja wetu, tujue ya kwamba
pale 2027 tutafanya mtihani na hawa wananchi na kila mtu atakuja na kazi yake
amefanya,"" said Ruto.
""So hakuna haja ya kusumbuana hapa
katikati; wacha tungoje hii mtihani, kila mtu afanye mtihani tuone nani ni wa
kupita na nani ni wa kuanguka.""
In an apparent reference to the recent
anti-government demonstrations, President Ruto seemingly advised Kenyan youth against
engaging in the protests, citing incidents of disorder and property destruction
that occurred.
The Head of State – in a similar voice - went
on to tell Kenyans to cease the riots and instead wait for the next polls and make
their voices heard.
""Tusikubali nchi yetu iharibike ama
tulete fujo, vita ama mambo itaharibu amani ya taifa yetu ya Kenya. Sisi ni
nchi ya demokrasia na katika demokrasia ni wananchi wanaamua na wanaamua katika
uchaguzi. So kila mtu ajipange; mimi najipanga, hii uchaguzi tutakutana. Hakuna
problem. Tutakutana kwa uchaguzi na kila mtu atakuja atandike kazi yake ile
amefanya na nyinyi wananchi ni watu werevu,"" he said.
""Nyinyi mtajua huyu amefanya kazi apite;
huyu ameshindwa na kazi aende nyumbani. Hakuna haja ya kuharibu amani ya nchi;
hakuna haja ulete fujo Kenya. Hakuna haja ya kutumia njia ya mkato. Wananchi
hawa ni werevu na ndio wanaamua vile Kenya itasonga mbele.""

The meeting at State House Nairobi, presided over by President William Ruto, was informed that, while the riots began as a protest against tax measures proposed in the Finance Bill 2024, they were infiltrated, hijacked, and taken over by criminal and opportunistic political forces.
The two groups have terrorised Kenyans in cities, towns, and other urban areas for the past two weeks, resulting in deaths and the destruction of National and County government buildings, infrastructure, vehicles, homes, and businesses.
Due to the threat to Parliament, the Supreme Court, and other infrastructure, the Cabinet was informed that all national security agencies, including the military, had been deployed to prevent a breakdown in law and order.
The Cabinet was also informed that the security agencies have stabilised the situation and will continue to monitor developments.
The members commended security officers, pointing out that they on the whole acted professionally in very difficult circumstances. The Cabinet also noted that security agencies did a good job of protecting the country from anarchists.
The President said the government must now focus on charting a new future for the country, pointing out that significant changes must be made to align with that new future.
On any officers who may have acted outside the confines of the law, the Cabinet said they will be dealt with in accordance with legal procedure and by the institutions mandated to do so.
The Cabinet also called for action against those who have committed heinous crimes of arson, looting and robbery, among others, saying such atrocities must not go unpunished.
On the withdrawn Finance Bill, President Ruto said the National Treasury is reorganising the budget to accommodate the new reality.
This will include substantial cutting down of budgets to ""balance between what to be implemented and what can wait"", and ensuring that key national programmes are not affected.
""Our plan is good and solid and, in the fullness of time, we shall be vindicated,"" President Ruto said.
On other agenda, the Cabinet discussed the implementation of the Kenya Urban Improvement Project in the Nairobi Metropolitan Area.
This includes the phased out upgrade of the 163km Nairobi Commuter Rail. The first phase of the upgrade will comprise improving the 58km commuter rail between the Nairobi Central Railway Station and Thika.
The project will also include acquisition of new locomotives and improvement of non-motorised transport infrastructure, and feeder roads along the Nairobi Commuter Rail network.
The Cabinet also approved the following Bills policies:
Kenya Secondary Education Equity and Quality Improvement Programme
Kenya-United Arab Emirates Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement
Co-Hosting of the Second Edition of the African Continental Free Trade Area Youth Symposium on September 5-7, 2024
Public Finance Management (Amendment) Bill 2024
Ratification of Bilateral Air Services Agreements between Kenya and various countries, including Somalia, Morocco, Algeria, Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Guinea, the United Kingdom and South Korea

https://www.citizen.digital/news/israeli-forces-pound-north-and-south-gaza-battle-hamas-in-rafah-n344743,"Israeli forces pound north and south Gaza, battle Hamas in Rafah
Residents said fighting intensified in the Tel Al-Sultan neighbourhood in western Rafah, where tanks were also trying to force their way north amid heavy clashes.
The armed wings of Hamas and the Islamic Jihad said fighters attacked Israeli forces with anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs.
Since early May, ground fighting has focused on Rafah, abutting Egypt on Gaza's southern edge, where around half of the enclave's 2.3 million people had been sheltering after fleeing other areas. Most have since had to flee again.
Israel says that it is close to destroying the last remaining Hamas battalions in Rafah, after which it will move to smaller scale operations in the enclave.
Medics said two Palestinians were killed in one Israeli missile strike in Rafah.
The Israeli military said in a statement its forces killed a Hamas militant who had been involved in the smuggling of weapons through the border between Rafah and Egypt.
It said jets struck dozens of militant targets in Rafah overnight, including fighters, military structures and tunnel shafts.
Later on Wednesday, an Israeli strike killed three Palestinians and wounded others near the northern Jabalia camp, one of the Gaza Strip's eight historic refugee camps, medics said.
Residents and Hamas media said the casualties were among a group of people who gathered outside a store to get an internet signal to communicate with relatives elsewhere in the enclave.
In Nuseirat camp in the central Gaza Strip, tank shells struck an apartment, killing at least five people and wounding others, medics said.
The Israeli military had no immediate comment.
HOSTAGE DEAL PLEA
Israel's ground and air campaign in Gaza was triggered when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.
The Israeli offensive in retaliation has so far killed 37,658 people, of them 60 in the past 24 hours, the Gaza health ministry said on Tuesday, and has left the tiny, heavily built-up Gaza Strip in ruins.
The Gaza health ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants, but officials say most those killed have been civilians. Israel has lost 314 soldiers in Gaza and says at least a third of the Palestinian dead are fighters.
More than eight months into the war, international mediation backed by the U.S. has failed to yield a ceasefire agreement.
Hamas says any deal must bring an end to the war and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, while Israel says it will accept only temporary pauses in fighting until Hamas is eradicated.
Orly Gilboa, whose 20-year-old daughter Daniela is being held hostage in Gaza, called on Israeli leaders to accept the deal and on the international community to pressure Hamas to do the same.
""The deal is there to be signed and implemented. I'm asking my own government to stand behind its own proposal, to be brave as our girls are, to save them, to save us. Time is running out,"" she told a press conference in Tel Aviv.
SEVERE FOOD SHORTAGE
In the northern Gaza Strip, Palestinians complained of a severe lack of food and soaring prices, and health officials said thousands of children were suffering from malnutrition that has already killed at least 30 since Oct. 7.
""There is only flour and canned food, there is nothing else to eat, no vegetables, no meat, and no milk,"" said Abu Mustafa, who lives in Gaza City, with his family.
Their house was struck in the past week by an Israeli tank, that destroyed most of the upper floor.
""Apart from the bombing, there is another Israeli war taking place in northern Gaza, starvation. People meet in the street and many can't recognise one another because of weight loss and older looks,"" Abu Mustafa told Reuters via a chat app.
Gaza remains at high risk of famine, though delivery of some aid has limited the projected spread of extreme hunger in northern areas, a global monitor said on Tuesday.
More than 495,000 people across the Gaza Strip are facing the most severe, or ""catastrophic"", level of food insecurity, according to an update from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) a global partnership used by the United Nations and aid agencies.
Wrapping up a visit to Washington, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Israel was fighting against Hamas, not the people of Gaza.
""We are committed, and I am personally committed, to facilitating the delivery of essential humanitarian aid to Gaza. We only fight those who seek to harm us,"" Gallant said in a video statement.

Law Society of Kenya
(LSK) President Faith Odhiambo’s chief of staff Ernest Nyerere has been arrested under
unclear circumstances.
Nyerere was picked up from his house at 5
a.m. on Tuesday by people believed to be police officers, Odhiambo told journalists.
His arrest adds him to
the growing list of Kenyans captured and held captive in undisclosed
locations in what is seen to be a government suppression of the ongoing
anti-Finance Bill 2024 protests, now in their second week.
In the wee hours of
Tuesday, popular social commentator Gabriel Oguda was allegedly abducted by suspected police officers from his house.
The others are John
Frank Githaiga alias Frenje, Drey Mwangi, Khalif Kairo and Osama Otero, who were
also reportedly captured overnight.
Odhiambo said they
were following up on the whereabouts of these Kenyans, as well as Shadrack Kiprono, alias Shad. Kiprono was vocal in last week's demos and was abducted on Saturday night in Nairobi’s South B area.
LSK in a statement on
Tuesday morning condemned the abductions as a return to darkness, with Odhiambo
vowing that the lawyers' body will bring those orchestrating the abductions to
book.
""Over the last 72
hours, Kenya has been drawn back to the dark era of a rogue, irrational police
force operating through repressive, retrogressive, clandestine, illegal,
extra-judicial tactics to forcefully quell public dissent against misgivings of
government, lapses in governance and more specifically, the contentious Finance
Bill 2024,"" Odhiambo said.
""We will unmask
and take action against these rogue criminal elements putting our police in
ruin.""
The LSK president has been at
the forefront of securing the release of protesters arrested over the anti-Finance
Bill demonstrations.
Some of those released
last weekend after a public uproar are Dr Austin Omondi, alias Ja Prado, who
was set free on Sunday night.
Omondi was running a
blood donation drive for injured protesters at Sikh Union along Nairobi’s
Forest Road and is said to have been captured by individuals in a vehicle
bearing the registration number KCU 819H.
Prominent X user Billy
Simani, alias Crazy Nairobian, was on Saturday evening released from police
custody following his arrest on Friday.
A nationwide strike
dubbed #TotalShutdownKE on Tuesday kicked off in Nairobi's central business district and other towns such as Nakuru, Mombasa and Eldoret, as youth continue to pressure
parliamentarians to shoot down the bill.
The proposed law
passed its Second Reading in the House last Tuesday after 204 MPs voted yes to
the bill while 115 voted no. It enters the Committee Stage this week.

Democrats shocked by Joe Biden's dismal debate performance urged the US president Tuesday to be transparent about his mental fitness as he faced the first call from his own side to drop out of the election.
Some supporters have expressed growing doubts about the 81-year-old's candidacy after last week's televised showdown with Donald Trump, when Biden stumbled over his words and lost his train of thought -- exacerbating fears about his age.
Congressman Lloyd Doggett became the first Democratic lawmaker to publicly call on Biden to make way for another candidate, saying he was hopeful the president would ""make the painful and difficult decision to withdraw.""
Nancy Pelosi, a Democratic Party heavyweight and former speaker of the House, said it was ""legitimate"" to ask whether Biden's debate disaster was indicative of a deeper problem rather than a one-off.
Biden has not given a live interview since the debacle, but will be interviewed by ABC on Friday with the first clips released later that day.
On Tuesday, he blamed exhaustion from international travel for his debate flop.
Speaking at a fundraiser, Biden said he ""wasn't very smart"" for ""traveling around the world a couple times... shortly before the debate.""
""I didn't listen to my staff,"" he said. ""And then I almost fell asleep on stage.""
Biden traveled to France from June 5 to 9 to commemorate the 1944 Allied landings, headed back to the United States, and then flew to Italy for a G7 summit followed immediately by a visit to California.
He then returned home and went to a presidential retreat for several days of rest and preparation for the debate.
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Tuesday admitted the debate was ""a bad night"" but added that Biden ""knows how to come back"" from adversity.
She dismissed questions about him needing a cognitive test, and said the president would hold a press conference during a NATO summit in Washington next week.
The polling margins between the president and his Republican predecessor have been razor-thin for months, with Trump showing a slight advantage.
Biden pushed for an unusually early first debate in hopes that he could jolt the race while there was still time -- but the plan backfired.
Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse told WPRI-TV he was ""pretty horrified"" by the president's performance during the 90-minute CNN match-up, watched by more than 50 million Americans.
Jared Golden, a vulnerable Democrat in a conservative-leaning House district, raised eyebrows with an op-ed in his local paper in Maine in which he said Biden's poor showing ""was not a surprise.""
""The outcome of this election has been clear to me for months: While I don't plan to vote for him, Donald Trump is going to win,"" he wrote.
The White House said Biden would meet with Democratic governors on Wednesday evening.
One of them, J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, explained that the governors had asked for the opportunity to hear from the president directly.
""Right now, Joe Biden is our nominee, and I'm 100 percent on board with supporting him as our nominee, unless he makes some other decision, and then I think we're all going to be discussing what's the best way forward,"" he told CNN.
Biden has visibly slowed over the last year.
It has been several months since the president, who has tripped or fallen in public on several occasions, stopped using his plane's high gangway, preferring a shorter, more stable staircase.
He has also surrounded himself with aides for the short walk from the White House to his helicopter on the lawn, hoping to prevent cameras from focusing on his stiff gait.
Biden, who has always been gaffe-prone, has not given a long press conference since January 2022 and spends most weekends in one of his Delaware homes, with no official schedule.
Vice President Kamala Harris -- a leading contender to replace Biden if he exits the race -- said Tuesday she was proud to be his running mate.
""We beat Trump once and we're going to beat him again,"" she said.

The final attempt at hosting the space lasted 22 minutes, with the bulk of the time spent trying to sort out technical hitches marked with loud silence as some of those handling the backend forgot to mute the President's microphone, leaving listeners hearing the goings-on.
In between the long pauses of silence, Kenyans on X (KOX) took to the comments section and engaged in their usual peculiar behaviours, with many saying, “follow for a follow back”, as people on the platform decided to use the space to get to know each other and build the number of their followers.
While all this was going on, KOX were treated to more than four parallel X Spaces being hosted by different individuals in a bid to counter the President’s space.
At least two of the counter spaces adopted a similar title to the hashtag of the President’s official X Space: #EngagethePresident.
As a last resort, the government opted to have President Ruto address Gen Z and other X listeners using influencer, Otero’s X account.
With Otero as the host, State House spokesperson, Hussein Mohammed, was a speaker and the President joined the conversation using the State House X handle, rather than his personal handle.
He started by apologizing for the more than hour-long delay, blaming the hitches on the challenges that come with using technology.
He went on to say that he opted to engage citizens on the X platform because he had been accused of not listening to what the people want and was there to prove that he indeed listens.
The President said that the rejection of the Finance Bill was as a result of propaganda and that Kenyans will come to see that the Bill was beneficial.

A total of 39 people have been killed in anti-government demonstrations in Kenya, the national rights watchdog said Monday, as activists geared up for a new round of protests this week.
The toll announced by the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights is almost double the figure previously disclosed by the authorities for those killed while contesting a raft of deeply unpopular tax increases that have now been withdrawn.
""Data from our records indicates that thirty-nine people have died and three hundred and sixty-one injured in relation to the protests countrywide,"" the state-funded body said in a statement, adding that the figures covered the period from June 18 to July 1.
It also said there had been 32 cases of ""enforced or involuntary disappearances"" and 627 arrests of protesters.
Largely peaceful anti-tax rallies -- led by mostly young Gen-Z protesters -- descended into shocking scenes of deadly violence last Tuesday when lawmakers passed the contentious legislation.
After the vote was announced, crowds ransacked the parliament complex in central Nairobi and it was partly set ablaze as police fired live bullets at protesters.
It is the most serious crisis to confront Ruto since he took office in September 2022 following a deeply divisive election in a nation often considered a beacon of stability in a turbulent region.
- 'Excessive and disproportionate force' -
""The Commission continues to condemn in the strongest terms possible the unwarranted violence and force that was inflicted on protesters, medical personnel, lawyers, journalists and on safe spaces such as churches, medical emergency centres and ambulances,"" the KNCHR said.
""We maintain that the force used against the protesters was excessive and disproportionate.""
The KNCHR also said it ""strongly condemns the violent and shocking acts of lawlessness that was exhibited by some of the protesters"" including the parliament and other government buildings.
The Kenyan authorities were taken by surprise after small rallies against the tax increases gathered momentum, with thousands of people taking to the streets.
Fresh protests have been called by activists starting from Tuesday despite Ruto announcing last week that he would not sign into law the bill containing the tax hikes.
Leaflets have been posted on social media with the hashtags ""Occupy Everywhere"", ""Ruto must go"" and ""Reject Budgeted Corruption"".
The president said in a television interview Sunday that 19 people had died in the protests, but insisted he did not have ""blood on my hands"" and pledged an investigation into the deaths.
Kenya's cash-strapped government had said previously that the tax increases were necessary to service the massive public debt of some 10 trillion shillings ($78 billion), equal to roughly 70 percent of GDP.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has urged the country to implement fiscal reforms in order to access crucial funding from the Washington-based lender.
Ruto had already rolled back some tax measures after the protests began, prompting the treasury to warn of a gaping budget shortfall of 200 billion shillings ($1.6 billion).
In Sunday's interview, he had warned that the government would have to borrow heavily following the decision to scrap the finance bill.

https://www.citizen.digital/wananchi-reporting/leave-your-crocs-crop-tops-at-home-and-dont-wear-makeup-gen-z-protesters-warned-n344621,"Leave your crocs, crop tops at home and don't wear makeup, Gen Z protesters warned
While some have questioned their style of doing things, for example in the workplace - the group has broken away from practices common with previous generations, especially Gen X and the Boomers, such as working at one employment station for the better part of their working years - and have embraced the 'do you ' mantra.
For them, it is not enough to have a salary. For many Gen Zs, work has to be meaningful for them to stay with an employer. And even then, it is not uncommon to have them switch employers every so often, sometimes after a couple of months.
This generation doesn't take the 'dress how you want to be addressed ' slogan to heart and will show up to work in jeans, a crop top and even crocs or sneakers. After all, it's the talent that counts, right?
On the subject of dressing, Gen Z have been easy to spot in the recent protests that have rocked the country as a section of citizens protest against the contents of the Finance Bill 2024.
Clad in sneakers, black crop tops, and cargo pants and other trendy wear, many Gen Zs have been captured exercising their democratic rights to protest in the streets. From Nairobi to Eldoret, the youths have been hard to miss, making up the majority of protesters.
However, the group, and all protesters in general, have been warned against showing up to protests in certain attire.
Specifically crocs, tank tops and any other attire that leaves the body exposed.
In an X Space conversation held on Monday night ahead of today's expected protests against the Bill as it heads to the committee of the whole house, protesters have been advised to dress appropriately, with clothes that fully cover their bodies to reduce the effects of teargas.
""Please dress appropriately. Cover yourself up. I know it's baddie season, crop tops and shorts... but cover yourself as much as you can. Remember teargas goes for moist surfaces. You're going to be sweating so as long as it lands on your skin, it's going to irritate your skin,"" Dr Hope, a medical doctor, said during an X Space titled 'Dos and Don'ts during protests' organised by Eric Muriu, an advocate of the High Court.
Hope advised protesters to refrain from wearing open shoes and crocs, and instead opt for sneakers, which are functional and comfortable, or boots.
On jewelry, protesters were advised to wear the most dainty pieces if necessary.
""Avoid wearing loops or jewellery that can put you at risk of someone grabbing it or it getting attached to something"" she said.
""Avoid wearing makeup because once the teargas gets to your face, you'll have to wash it and it will irritate your eyes more.""
She went ahead to advise the wearing of personal protective equipment (PPs), whether the N95 ones, or the basic masks.
Protesters were advised to have situational awareness and behaviour aware of their surroundings.
The protests today come amid an uproar following a series of abductions of online influencers who have been criticising the Bill.

Niger's ruling junta in April ordered the U.S. to withdraw its nearly 1,000 military personnel from the country following a coup last year in the West African nation.
""Thanks to effective cooperation and communication between the Nigerian and American armed forces, this operation was completed ahead of schedule and without any complications,"" Niger's defence ministry and the U.S. Department of Defense said in a joint statement.
The focus will next shift to withdrawal from the $100 million drone base near Agadez in central Niger, which had provided crucial intelligence about jihadist-linked groups, U.S. Air Force Major General Kenneth Ekman said on Friday.
The pullout from that base, known as Air Base 201, will likely take place in August, he said.
Niger's ruling junta has given the U.S. until Sept. 15 to remove troops from its territory.
In April, Russia sent military trainers to Niger.
Niger and its military-led neighbours Mali and Burkina Faso signed a confederation treaty on Saturday, signalling an ever-closer alignment between the countries in the insurgency-torn central Sahel.
They have torn up defence agreements with U.S., European and United Nations forces.

The lawmaker noted that he suffered losses amounting to Ksh.550 million during the Tuesday protests after his supermarket in Kieni, Nyeri County was razed down.
These included stock worth Ksh.450 million and equipment such as bakery shelves estimated to cost around Ksh.100 million.
Further, the legislator claimed he paid the price for voting in support of the Finance Bill.
""The scrap metal dealers are now scavenging for the metallic stands that remained after the inferno even as the employees have been left jobless,"" he told The Standard, pointing out that he had 350 employees.
The lawmaker explained that despite incurring huge losses, he did not regret voting for the Bill as he did for the sake of his constituents.
""I voted in support of the Bill because the people of Kieni stood to benefit from it being an agricultural zone where our people farm onions, potatoes, eggs and milk will enjoy all the way to the bank because the competition from outside the country would have been reduced with the passage of the bill,"" he noted.
The MP also alleged that the vandalism and looting were orchestrated by goons posing as peaceful protestors.
Several MPs who supported the bill have acknowledged paying the price for their stance, which contradicted the voice of the people.
Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi also condemned the chaos after his Timber XO nightclub was vandalised.
""What transpired on Tuesday, which followed an otherwise peaceful protest by Gen-Z is unfortunate. However, the magnitude of loss of lives, looting and property destruction that happened is appalling and it negates the spirit of our constitution,"" he said.
Kenyans online were hell-bent on pursuing the 204 MPs who voted in support of the bill following the passing of the Second Reading stage.
The lawmakers' numbers were shared online as Kenyans voiced their frustrations on the leaders who are supposed to represent the will of the people.
As pressure mounted and protests raged on, President William Ruto ceded and declined to sign the Finance Bill.

Published on: July 10, 2024 09:53 (EAT)
Djokovic prepares to serve against Márton Fucsovics in the French Open second round. PHOTO/COURTESY: CNN
Alex de Minaur is the latest man standing in the way of the Novak Djokovic juggernaut on Wednesday as the Serbian superstar eyes a 13th Wimbledon semi-final.
Former champion and fourth seed Elena Rybakina, the top woman left in the draw, faces Elina Svitolina.
Citizen Sports looks at Wednesday's four Wimbledon quarter-finals:
Feisty Djokovic
A historic 25th Grand Slam triumph is coming into sharp focus for Novak Djokovic, who demolished Holger Rune in straight sets in the fourth round.
Such has been his impressive form that it is easy to forget the 37-year-old had knee surgery after suffering an injury at the French Open.
But the Serb, also aiming to equal Roger Federer's record of eight men's singles Wimbledon titles, showed a typically prickly reaction after beating Rune in reaction to crowd support for his Danish opponent.
""If somebody steps over the line, I react,"" he said. ""That's basically what it was. After the match I said what I said.""
The world number two divided fans when he burst onto the scene, unafraid to ruffle feathers as he went about smashing the Roger Federer-Rafael Nadal duopoly, even as he built up a loyal army of fans.
Australia's Alex de Minaur, who won the 's-Hertogenbosch event on grass last month, can at least take heart from his victory against Djokovic at the United Cup in January.
Rybakina's serene progress
Elena Rybakina is the only former women's champion still in the draw at Wimbledon after an 18th win in 20 matches at the All England Club.
The Russian-born Kazakh player joins Ann Jones and Steffi Graf as the only players in the Open Era to have a 90 percent win rate in the women's singles at the championship.
The fourth seed said she is a different player from the one who won the title in 2022 -- her only Grand Slam triumph to date.
""It is different,"" she said. ""At the same time when you go on the court you are still nervous a little bit. I think now with all the experience, I just enjoy much more on the court.""
On the other side of net is 21st-seed Elina Svitolina, who broke down in tears after her win against China's Wang Xinyu on Monday following the deaths of dozens of people in her native Ukraine as a result of Russian strikes.
""I'm playing, of course, such an amazing event as Wimbledon,"" she said. ""I have to also think about how I can use that in a way for Ukrainian people. At least with my win today, it was a small light that brought a happy moment for Ukrainian people.""
Red-hot Ostapenko
Jelena Ostapenko takes on Barbora Krejcikova in a battle between two former French Open champions.
Latvia's Ostapenko has dropped just 15 games so far and spent only a shade over four hours on court.
Despite her win at Roland Garros in 2017, Ostapenko's best Grand Slam is Wimbledon -- she made the quarter-finals in the same year as her French Open triumph and a year later reached the semi-finals.
The 14th-ranked player also won the junior Wimbledon title, in 2014.
""This tournament is very special with the traditions,"" she said. ""It's just when you come here, the atmosphere is completely different from any other Grand Slam.
""I feel this place is, like, I don't know, for every tennis player it's a dream to win Wimbledon.""
Krejcikova, who won at Roland Garros in 2021, had never been beyond the fourth round at Wimbledon before this year but impressed in her last-16 win against Danielle Collins.
Taylor Fritz produced a stunning performance to come back against fourth seed Alexander Zverev in the fourth round, winning in five sets.
The American 13th seed has form on grass, winning eight straight matches dating back to the start of the Eastbourne International last month.
""If you take the risk and go for a shot, you should be rewarded for it,"" he said. ""I think that's what I really love about grass.""
His opponent, 25th-ranked Lorenzo Musetti, defeated Fritz 6-4, 6-4 earlier this year on clay in Monte Carlo.

Cases of youth engaging in crime after dropping out of school have led to concerted calls for parents to be more involved in raising their children.
Residents of Baragoi in Samburu county have raised the alarm over cases of crime involving youths who have abandoned their education.
Vivian Lekisat, a resident, said, “Some parents are not setting a good example for their children because they themselves are addicted to alcohol. How will they raise their children when they get inebriated and end up sleeping on the pavement instead of going home?”
Speaking during a drive to encourage parents to enrol their children in school, she went ahead to say that poverty and illiteracy have also had a negative effect on families, with some parents spending the little money they get on illicit brew and neglecting to take care of their children, which has driven some to engage in crime to fend for themselves.
Samson Lolrdai, another resident, “A big problem is that many parents have not completed their education and so they do not see the need for their children to get an education either.”
“My own parents did not complete their education and neither did I, but I saw the need to educate my children because I have seen the impact children who have gone to school are making and I am confident my efforts will bear fruit.”
Doris Lembesi said she has seen the impact of not monitoring children and encouraged others to prioritise their children and take them to school.
“Many who have been left to their own devices have ended up becoming criminals and they do not have any respect for their parents. It is important to emphasize the importance of education to improve their chances in life so that they are not stuck doing menial jobs,” she said.
Benard Korir, a children’s officer in Samburu county, said, “We have seen many children being abandoned at a tender age. This makes it easy for them to be lured into criminal activity and it has led to cases of teen pregnancy.”
He urged parents to monitor their children and enroll them in school to improve their lives.

The MCA was seeking treatment at a hospital in Makindu, where he spoke to the media about his reported kidnapping.
He claimed to have been abducted by people who introduced themselves as police officers from Embu.
According to the MCA, the detectives told him they were hunting down people believed to be inciting anti-government protests in the country.
He also claims to have been released by his abductors after begging them to let him go.
He had been reported missing after witnesses saw him being bundled into a car that sped off towards Mombasa direction from Makindu.
“The Wiper Democratic Movement (WDM) Party unequivocally condemns the abduction of Hon. Wambua, as a gross violation of human rights and equivalent to arbitrary arrests and enforced disappearance as prohibited under Article 29 of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010, “ stated the party.
“We demand that Hon. Wambua be released immediately and returned to his family in Makindu, Makueni County. We also demand that the government immediately end these illegal actions and release all others who have been arbitrarily arrested.
This follows a series of abductions, primarily targeting outspoken opponents of the 2024 finance bill and the government.

https://www.citizen.digital/lifestyle/the-journey-of-navigating-loss-and-trauma-for-orphaned-children-n345199,"The journey of navigating loss and trauma for orphaned children
A USAID report titled ‘Mwendo Orphans and Vulnerable Children Project 2019’ showed there are 2.6 million orphans and vulnerable children in Kenya, with 650,000 orphaned by AIDS.
This vulnerable population mostly hosts orphans, who are categorized as true orphans or social orphans.
True orphans have no parents or extended family to care for them, while social orphans come from families unable to provide care due to incarceration, extreme poverty, physical abuse, or abandonment.
These children, like all who have experienced profound loss, face cruelty of death and its aftermath, navigating a world where the support and comfort they once knew is gone. In the face of such loss, they confront their own vulnerabilities and the stark reality of life's impermanence.
NAVIGATING LOSS AND STRUGGLE
Georgina Cate, a pseudonym used for protection, is a Form Three student in Lugulu, Western Region. Together with her three siblings they have been forced to drop out of school due to lack of school fees.
“Our mother left us in this home one year after dad passed on and went to Nairobi in search of a job. Currently, her phone is switched off. We cannot reach her, and we do not know her whereabouts,” Georgina says with teary eyes.
Her brother David adds, “It has become hard living in this state. We often go out to get menial jobs to earn some money to buy food. I have a fee balance of over 50,000. I have tried to apply for a bursary, but I don’t get it, even though my fellow students receive this support. I have no idea what befell us.”
INTERNATIONAL AWARENESS AND ADVOCACY EFFORTS
The International Day of the African Child is celebrated annually on June 16. The theme for 2024 was ""Education for all children in Africa: the time is now.""
Despite this focus, achieving an educated African population faces challenges, especially for Kenya’s 2.6 million orphans and vulnerable children. They often lack access to basic education due to poverty, inadequate resources, and social stigma.
Therefore, targeted support is essential to ensure these marginalized groups receive the education and opportunities they deserve.
Childline Kenya plays a crucial role in child protection, reporting 917 cases of mental illness and torture among children in 2022. They provide immediate counseling and facilitate referrals to essential services, addressing gaps in comprehensive child protection and coordination mechanisms in Kenya.
Martha Sunday, MD at Childline, emphasizes, ""Cases of child rights violations remain prevalent in Kenya. Culture and collaboration are crucial for effective child protection. Increased reportage may suggest better awareness and referral pathways rather than a rise in actual cases.""
ADDRESSING CHILDHOOD TRAUMA
Gathoni Mbugua, an expert on children's mental health, explains how children often experience trauma due to loss and violations.
“They develop coping mechanisms to manage their emotional pain and navigate challenging circumstances, making early detection crucial. In African culture, we often assume that as long as a child is attending school and performing well, they are okay. However, they are not truly okay if they have experienced deep trauma,” Mbugua says.
""Some children may focus intensely on education to relieve emotional trauma, but this can worsen their mental health in the long run. They may enter an emotional numbing state, withdrawing and avoiding any triggers related to the loss or violations. They might avoid talking about it, shun relatives, and push the trauma into their unconscious. Others may turn to early substance abuse to numb their pain or dissociate from their environment, being physically present but emotionally absent,"" she further argues.
UNDERSTANDING EMOTIONAL NUMBING AND COPING MECHANISMS
Scientists explain that when children or adults experience trauma, their brains sometimes protect them by becoming numb to the pain. This numbing means they might not fully feel or remember what happened because it’s too overwhelming to handle all at once.
It’s like the brain hits a ""pause"" button to help them survive and function day-to-day. This emotional numbing can make them feel disconnected or emotionless about the traumatic event.
LEGAL AND SOCIAL SUPPORT FOR ORPHANED CHILDREN
Michael Nanjira, the children’s officer at a children’s home in Vihiga County acknowledges that before a child becomes a partial or total orphan, they are a child first.
“The Children’s Act of 2022 protects all children in Kenya. If there is no one from the community to take care of this child, they can be taken to a children's home until they turn 18. However, the child should maintain contact with their family and be granted visitation rights.”
Some children are often abandoned by their relatives once their parents pass away. This abandonment leads to childhood traumas and vulnerability to child violations due to lack of parental guidance and care. Children should be allowed to be children, not forced to work for pay or fend for themselves.
INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS AND PROVISIONS FOR CHILD PROTECTION
UNICEF advocates for alternative care options for children who cannot stay with their families, ensuring that these alternatives respect the rights and needs of children. It supports community-based child protection mechanisms to provide care and protection for vulnerable children.
The International Labour Organization (ILO) focuses on prohibiting and eliminating child labor through Conventions like the Minimum Age Convention (No. 138) and the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention (No. 182). The Decent Work Agenda ensures children are protected from economic exploitation and are not engaged in labor that interferes with their education or development.
Childhood trauma, especially for orphans, leaves deep and lasting scars. However, through compassion, support, and appropriate interventions, we can help these children heal and rebuild their lives.
Providing a nurturing environment, mental health support, and stable care are crucial steps in ensuring these children not only survive but thrive. Society must commit to being vigilant advocates for their well-being, ensuring every orphaned child has the chance to experience a safe, healthy, and hopeful future.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/ruto-calls-for-reviewing-of-salary-increment-for-state-officers-says-govt-has-to-live-within-its-means-n345139,"Ruto calls for reviewing of salary increment for state officers, says gov't has to live within its means
This after a gazette notice dated August 9, 2023, by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC) announced upwards salary reviews for the Executive and Legislature from July 1, 2024. The changes have sparked public uproar amid the cry to cut public expenditure.
Ruto, through State House spokesperson Hussein Mohamed, directed the National Treasury to review the gazette notice in light of the now-withdrawn Finance Bill 2024 and the fiscal constraints expected in the financial year 2024/25.
""The President has emphasized that this is a time, more than ever before, for the Executive & all arms of government to live within their means,"" said Mohamed on X.
Public Service Cabinet Secretary Moses Kuria has also stated that despite SRC being mandated to do regular salary reviews for all state officers, it needs to maintain austerity measures.
Kuria maintained that there is a need to adhere to the resolutions of the Third National Wage Bill Conference of reducing the Wage bill to 35 percent of the national budget down from 46 percent.
""I reiterate my observations during the Conference that it is not sustainable to have 900,000 public servants from both levels of Government consume Ksh 1.1 trillion annually, which is equivalent to 47 percent of national revenues, leaving the rest of 54 million Kenyans with 53 percent, with debt servicing and development to cater for, among other expenditure. I believed then, just as now, that this is more of a moral and ethical issue than an economic issue,"" said Kuria in a statement.
""Our current trajectory indicates a continual rise in expenditure on salaries, allowances, and benefits for public servants, placing immense strain on our national finances. This is not a challenge we can afford to ignore.""
Kuria therefore denied to implement the gazette notice, demanding SRC to de-gazette the new salary structure.
The report would see Cabinet Secretaries earning Ksh.990,000 from Ksh.957,000 alongside other allowances, the Attorney General and the Prime Cabinet Secretary will also earn a salary increment of the same amount.
Principal Secretaries (PSs) were to bag Ksh.819,844 up from Ksh.792,519.
Speakers Moses Wetangula (National Assembly) and Amason Kingi (Senate) would both enjoy a hefty perk from Ksh.1.1 million to Ksh.1.2 million.
Governors were to take home Ksh.990,000 from Ksh.957,000 as all the 349 MPs and 67 senators from Ksh.725,502 to Ksh. 739,600.
The Inspector General of Police together with the National Intelligence Service Director General were set to earn Ksh.819,844 up from Ksh.792,519.

The East African Community (EAC) has published a gazette notice itemizing the approved measures on import duty rates in the EAC External Tariff (EAC CET) on its website.
Kenya has imposed a 10% import duty on crude palm oil which means the price of cooking fat and margarine for the next year.
Other refined oils which have been slapped with higher taxes are; Refined soybean oil, RDB Palm Olein, Sunflower oil, and refined corn oil which Kenya has imposed a duty rate of 25% for one year.
Baby Diapers have been lined up for increased taxation; as Kenya and other EAC members decided to apply a duty rate of 35% for one year a 10% rise from the previous tax rate.
As for mobile phones, Kenya has also imposed a duty rate of 25% for one year which as expected, will have the net effect of an increase in prices of mobile phones.
Television sets will now apply a duty rate of 35% up from 25% last year.
The gazette notice is a culmination of deliberations by member states and is not tied to the controversial Finance Bill in Kenya. The 131-page document is currently on the front page of the EAC website.
The timing of the notice comes at a dicey time when the Kenyan government which dropped its controversial Finance Bill after intense protests led by the youth.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/koskei-orders-all-cabinet-secretaries-to-reduce-number-of-advisers-to-one-n345601,"Koskei orders all Cabinet Secretaries to reduce number of advisers to one
State House Chief of Staff and Head of Public
Service Felix Koskei has ordered all Cabinet Secretaries and State officials to
reduce the number of personal assistants and advisers attached to them to one
by Thursday this week.
In a letter addressed to the Cabinet dated
Monday, July 8, Koskei referred to President William Ruto’s directive on Friday
last week that sought to reduce the number of advisers in government by 50 per
cent in order to improve efficiency and cut public expenditure.
Koskei said the move would also be in line
with ensuring proper utility of public funds in a bid to restore public confidence
and increase accountability on the side of the government.
“The Address outlined policy interventions
aimed at ensuring that the sacrifices made by taxpayers are matched by fiscal
discipline in the public service. The measures announced also seek to restore
faith in public institutions by enhancing accountability, transparency, and the
strengthening of good governance within them. In that regard, it is notified
that the President directed that the number of advisers in
government be reduced by 50% with immediate effect,” stated Koskei.
“By dint of that Presidential Action, the
number of advisers assigned to each Cabinet Secretary has been revised from two
to one. Additionally, the number of personal staff attached to you will remain
as set out in the Public Service Commission guidelines being two (2) staffers.”
In light of the directive, the Head of Public
Service also advised the Cabinet members to assess the office requirements and
list the adviser or assistant that one needed to retain.
He said that the extra staff will consequently
be phased out by the Public Service Commission (PSC).
“Consequently, you are requested to assess
the requirements of your office and indicate the adviser you would wish to
retain to support you in the discharge of your portfolio mandate,” he directed.
“Accordingly, and by way of this circular
letter, you are directed to submit to the Public Service Commission the full
name of the adviser to be retained, with a copy to this office by the close of
business on Thursday, 11th July 2024.”
President Ruto last week committed to implement changes in the Cabinet and
also announced a raft of austerity measures across various government agencies
to align the country’s budgetary expenditure to the implications of the
withdrawn Finance Bill, 2024 after pressure from the Gen Zs through protests.
Ruto also said that the decision to fill the
position of Chief Administrative Secretary (CAS) effectively stands suspended, adding
that the number of advisors attached to the Executive will be slashed by 50 per
cent.
“Budget lines providing for the operations of
the First Lady, the Spouse of the Deputy President and Prime Cabinet Secretary
will be removed,” he announced then.
“Similarly, budget provisions for
confidential budgets in various Executive offices including my own office have
been removed, and the budget for the renovations across government reduced by
50 per cent.”

Speaking during the launch of the Nyeri County gender and development policy and widows sacco at the Governor's Office, Dorcas emphasised the need for the widows to be empowered economically to support the family.
She noted that in most African traditional homes, widows decline to remarry and instead opt to take care of the children.
Dorcas noted that the sacco would encourage the widows to embrace income-generating ideas to sustain an income.
“When the husband leaves the wife (Widow) it doesn’t mean that she should be a beggar, she can take care of her children,"" she said.
""Economic empowerment is the gateway through which all economic, social and cultural barriers are broken. Through the empowerment of widows, they can make independent decisions and overcome challenges. The launch of this gender policy will lay a strong foundation for the promotion of gender equality across all sectors.""
The meeting brought together widows and widowers from across the county.
Dorcas also appealed to the families to leave a written will to dictate how each property would be distributed.
""The larger majority in the African tradition don't marry they prefer to remain single and take care of children. When she is supposed to be empowered, everything centers on the husband such as leadership. The title, wealth belongs to the man. If a man doesn't leave a will, the woman is left to suffer and struggle.""

Mara Sugar Football Club has officially been crowned champions as the FKF National Super League (NSL)curtains for season 2024 came down on Sunday, at the Police Sacco Stadium.
Despite a narrow 1-2 defeat to Vihiga Bullets in their last National Super League game Sunday evening, Mara Sugar's crowning moment could not be darkened as their overall season performance had already won them the title, presented at the Dandora Stadium.
Denilson Imbayi opened the scoresheet for Vihiga Bullets in the 30th minute, while Mara equalised in the 60th minute with a goal from David Owino.

At the height of the anti-Finance Bill demos, celebrities from Nigeria, Jamaica, Tanzania and elsewhere showed their open support, many encouraging young Kenyans to stay put and keep up the fight.
From Joeboy to Jamaica's Queen Ifrica, these superstars made their stance known, some, like Christina Shusho, even changing their profile pictures to that of the Kenyan flag.
And on Saturday, in what is an undeniable continuation of the Kenyan dominance in the global cultural discourse, Jamaican dancehall ace Konshens performed while holding the Kenyan flag, waving it high and even giving the country a shout-out.
As thousands of fans danced to his tune 'Gyal a Bubble', Konshens displayed his allegiance to Kenya, and in the crowd, too, Kenyan flags could be seen swaying from side to side, a clear testament of the moment's history-making moves.
""Kenya we see uno! (You!)... We have the flag for all the people! Buss a blank!"" Konshens said.
The Summerjam crowd the reacted wildly, with thunderous applause and more vigorous waving of the Kenyan flag.
The Germany Summerjam concert happened just a day before the Shujaaz Concert at the Uhuru Park, held in honor of all the slain Kenyans who lost their lives during the anti-government demos over the last three weeks.
On Sunday, July 7, a day traditionally celebrated as 'SabaSaba', in honor of the second-liberation fighters, thousands of Kenyans filled Uhuru Park, with almost each one of them bringing along a Kenyan flag to pay tribute to the over 40 people shot and killed by the police in the Gen Z-led demonstrations.
Some of the biggest Kenyan music stars shared the stage - from Khaligrah Jones to Nameless, Octopizzo, Juliani and more.
Eric Wainaina's 'Daima' saw the thousands of concert-goers sink into a somber mood as they sang along, word by word, fists clenched high in the air.

On the X platform, a hashtag named “Gachagua Toothbrush” was toping trends, with multiple posts advocating for the impeachment of the Deputy President.
Alongside the posts were AI-generated images, depicting street marches and parliamentary sessions. In the AI-generated images, subjects were seen with placards reading ‘Impeach Riggy G.’
The propagators called for the impeachment of the Deputy President on grounds of violating constitutional provisions.
Alongside the campaign was an alleged letter on an impeachment motion. The said letter was linked to Mathira Member of Parliament Eric Wamumbi.
Citizen Digital reached out to Wamumbi, who dismissed the letter and the said impeachment motion against the DP.
""The letter is fake, it is not even signed,"" Wamumbi told Citizen Digital.
The perpetrators of the campaign also created news cards linked to local media stations.
The posters alleged Gachagua would be impeached on grounds of a mosquito nets scandal involving his son. Citizen Digital confirmed that local publications had not disseminated the cards.
Gachagua vs Wamumbi
The disinformation campaign follows public accusations made by both the Deputy President and the legislator.
On Sunday, Gachagua accused Wamumbi of derailing his war against illicit brew by allowing operations of bars in Mathira Constituency.
Wamumbi would later confirm the strained relationship with Gachagua, saying it was more than the closure of bars.
""It is true. There is a Rift between the Deputy president and I. The rift is not about the closed bars in Karatina town which have left the town dead for four months,"" Wamumbi said.

Clubs have struggled to give their best due to poor funding, and the veteran coach believes more can be achieved if the federation brought on board shirt sponsors and well paying broadcast partners.
“The league will be much better if there are sponsors. Financial constraints have been our biggest undoing.”
According to NyamuNyamu, sponsorship is crucial not only for the survival of all participating clubs but also to ensure that the league's winners receive a deserving award.
The financial backing, NyamuNyamu says would allow clubs to manage their operations effectively, support player development, and enhance overall team performance.
“Scheduling matches to be played at the same time and avoiding long breaks before playing another match will prevent cheating or match-fixing. It is currently the problem. Due to the delays, those with the motives find space to plan and carry out the outlawed activity.”
In addition to the financial concerns, NyamuNyamu highlighted the need for a more structured and fair scheduling system.
He urged the federation to ensure that all matches are played simultaneously and to avoid long breaks between games.
“Uniform match scheduling is a common practice in many top-tier leagues around the world. It ensures that all teams compete under similar conditions, maintaining the integrity of the competition,” he added.
“Long breaks can disrupt a team's momentum and create opportunities for unfair advantages.
“By standardizing match times, the league can foster a more competitive and honest environment, which is crucial for its reputation and credibility.”

Published on: July 10, 2024 07:18 (EAT)
A Chinese man was arrested and two others placed on a wanted list for allegedly defacing a Japanese war shrine that has long angered other Asian nations, Tokyo police said Wednesday.
The Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo honours 2.5 million mostly Japanese killed in wars since the late 19th century, including convicted war criminals.
Jiang Zhuojun, 29, who lives north of Tokyo, was arrested ""on suspicion of vandalism and disrespect for a place of worship"", a Tokyo metropolitan police spokesman told AFP.
Police also issued arrest warrants for two other Chinese men, Dong Guangming, 36, and Xu Laiyu, 25, placing them on wanted lists, but the spokesman said the two seem to have left the country.
Jiang, together with Dong, allegedly spray-painted the word ""toilet"" in red on a pillar of the shrine on May 31 while Xu filmed them, the spokesman said.
A video posted on Chinese social media showed a man appearing to urinate on the stone pillar before spray-painting it, local media reported.
The police spokesman confirmed officers had seen the video.
Dong earlier told Japanese broadcaster TBS that he admits the vandalism, but would not report to police because the conduct was a protest against Japan's release of treated wastewater from the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant.
The UN atomic watchdog says the discharge which began last August is harmless but China, later joined by Russia, banned all Japanese seafood imports, saying that Tokyo was treating the Pacific ""like a sewer"".
Yasukuni also includes a museum that portrays Japan largely as a victim of US aggression in WWII and makes scant reference to the extreme brutality of invading Imperial troops when they stormed through Asia.
Government ministers still regularly pay hommage at Yasukuni, infuriating China, South Korea and others, although no prime minister has visited since Shinzo Abe in 2013.

Tourism PS John Ololtuaa states that MKTE has been instrumental in facilitating local small and medium travel enterprises and start-ups to access international markets given that over 60% of the travel companies that exhibit at the expo can’t afford to participate in expos abroad.
He affirms that this can be the catalyst for the exponential growth of Kenya’s tourism sector, coupled with the diversification of its products.
“MKTE has over the years created linkages and partnerships between local tourism enterprises and regional and international source markets.
This has opened up new opportunities that have seen tremendous growth of local businesses in the tourism value chain. As a ministry, we recognize the immense potential that MKTE offers, especially to MSMEs in the tourism sector looking to establish themselves globally,"" said PS Ololtuaa.
The PS was speaking during an MKTE partners’ event whose 14th edition is set to be held from October 2nd-4th, 2024, at Uhuru Gardens, Nairobi. The partners had come together to explore collaboration opportunities and ways of enhancing the premier travel show in the East Africa Region.
In 2023, MKTE hosted over 3,000 delegates from 25 countries showcasing Kenya's diverse tourism offerings to the world. The 2024 edition will be targeting to attract 5,000 delegates and 160 hosted buyers including over 100 buyers’ clubs.
MKTE also returns as a standalone expo after a successful joint expo last year with the East African Regional Tourism Expo (EARTE), which offered the EAC member states an opportunity to network and explore new tourism business opportunities.
PS Ololtuaa emphasized the ministry's commitment to continued public-private sector engagement geared towards creating an enabling environment for tourism businesses to thrive.
""As a ministry, we are keen on continuously reviewing and reforming our policies to ensure that we create a conducive environment that allows tourism businesses, especially those at the grassroots, to realize their full potential,"" he added.
The PS also rallied stakeholders to focus efforts on promoting domestic tourism, which remains an untapped opportunity.
""As we seek to attract international visitors, we must not lose sight of the immense potential that lies in promoting domestic tourism as well. We need to further encourage Kenyans to explore their own country and take advantage of the high-quality experiences and facilities available right here at home,"" said Ololtuaa.
On her part, Kenya Tourism Board (KTB) CEO June Chepkemei expressed optimism that MKTE 2024 will build on the successes of previous editions.
“MKTE has built its reputation over the years as a consistent and affordable platform for Kenyan travel trade, County Governments, and affiliated brands in providing access to international suppliers and markets,” Chepkemei stated.
“This year, we are looking to increase hosted buyers from new source markets such as Americas – Brazil and Mexico; Asia – Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, and Australia besides the key source markets in Europe and Africa, in line with our destination diversification strategy,” said Chepkemei.
She added that KTB is working towards the targeted 3 million visitors by the end of 2024.

Hamas has accepted a U.S. proposal to begin talks on releasing Israeli hostages, including soldiers and men, 16 days after the first phase of an agreement aimed at ending the Gaza war, a senior Hamas source told Reuters on Saturday.
The militant Islamist group has dropped a demand that Israel first commit to a permanent ceasefire before signing the agreement, and would allow negotiations to achieve that throughout the six-week first phase, the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity because the talks are private.
A Palestinian official close to the internationally mediated peace efforts had said the proposal could lead to a framework agreement if embraced by Israel and would end the nine-month-old war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.
A source in Israel's negotiating team, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was now a real chance of achieving agreement.
That was in sharp contrast to past instances in the nine-month-old war in Gaza, when Israel said conditions attached by Hamas were unacceptable.
A spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath. On Friday his office said talks would continue next week and emphasised that gaps between the sides still remained.
The conflict has claimed the lives of more than 38,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, since Hamas attacked southern Israeli cities on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostages, according to official Israeli figures.
The new proposal ensures that mediators would guarantee a temporary ceasefire, aid delivery and the withdrawal of Israeli troops as long as indirect talks continue to implement the second phase of the agreement, the Hamas source said.
Efforts to secure a ceasefire and hostage release in Gaza have intensified over the past few days with active shuttle diplomacy among Washington, Israel and Qatar, which is leading mediation efforts from Doha, where the exiled Hamas leadership is based.
A regional source said the U.S. administration was trying hard to secure a deal before the presidential election in November.
Netanyahu said on Friday that the head of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency had returned from an initial meeting with mediators in Qatar and that negotiations would continue next week.

failure to qualify for Euro 2024.
The 44-year-old former Liverpool, Newcastle and Wales striker
leaves Burnley, where he was assistant to former manager Vincent Kompany last

in a penalty shoot-out to Poland in a play-off.
Page subsequently oversaw one of the most embarrassing results in
Wales' history, a 0-0 draw with Gibraltar in a friendly and then suffered a 4-0
hammering at the hands of Slovakia.
Former Wales defender Page admitted following the Slovakian defeat
he was in dangerous territory.

Portugal's veteran centre-back Pepe defended his
team's performance thus far at Euro 2024 before Monday's last 16 clash with
Slovenia.
The 2016 champions progressed as Group F winners but
were shocked by debutants Georgia on Wednesday in a 2-0 defeat, while also only
scraping a late 2-1 win against the Czech Republic in their opening match.
""I don't know if you've had the chance to look
at the statistics from the group stage -- Portugal are one of the best teams in
terms of statistics,"" Pepe told reporters on Friday.
""From the first game to the last, the fans were
always with us. The most important thing was the fact that, in the first game,
against Czech Republic, we were losing and the fans kept supporting us.
""Maybe it was that confidence they had that
made us turn the result around.""
Pepe became the oldest ever player to feature at the
competition against the Czechs, at 41 years old, a record he extended in the
3-0 win over Turkey, Portugal's best display in Germany.
He made his Euros debut in 2008 and is playing at
his fifth edition of the competition, which he won with Portugal eight years
ago.
Pepe said although Portugal were in the trickier
half of the draw -- along with Spain, Germany and France -- he did not care as
long as the Selecao found a way to triumph.
""If I could choose... I would like to be
champion again,"" said the former Real Madrid defender.
""With all due respect to the other teams, both
on one side and the other, that's what we have.
""We know it's going to be a very difficult
journey, that it's going to be tough, but we all have to stick together.""
The second oldest outfield player in Euros history
is Pepe's superstar team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo, 39, who failed to score in
three frustrating group stage appearances.
""Cristiano lives for goals, that's a fact, but
have you seen his availability on the field to help the national team? It's
incredible,"" continued Pepe.
""He's the player with the most minutes in our
team, at 39 years old. He's doing very well, he'll do very well for this final
stage of the European Championship and I hope and I'm sure that he will give us
a lot of joy.""
Pepe said he has not decided his future after Euro
2024 at international or club level, with his Porto contract expiring this
summer, but revealed the secrets to his own longevity at the top of the game.
""(It's) my passion for football -- I've said
many times that it's a privilege to be able to get up and do what I love most
with a lot of concentration and competitiveness, which is what I have,""
explained Pepe.
The defender, who was rested in the Georgia defeat,
said he takes frequent ice baths and is always looking to undergo recovery treatments.
""The physiotherapists say that the machines
basically belong to me, but it is so that I can recover as quickly as
possible,"" he continued.
""I know I don't recover as quickly as a
20-year-old, but I try to do my best to always be available for my coach.""

President William Ruto succumbed to mounting public pressure, announcing on Wednesday that he would not sign the contentious Finance Bill 2024.
The latest comes after a week of protests across the country, primarily led by Kenyan youth, who claim the punitive tax proposals will burden an already stretched population.
President Ruto, speaking at the State House, flanked by allied members of parliament, said that after listening to Kenyans who overwhelmingly rejected the Bill, he would not sign it into law.
""Having reflected on the continuing conversation around the content of the finance bill of 2024, I will decline to assent to the bill,"" President Ruto said.
""I propose an engagement with young people of our nation to listen to their issues and agree with them on their priority areas of concern."" He said.
He stated that moving forward, Kenya will need to engage in a multi-sectoral conversation about the public debt and the country's future.
""I also propose that within the next 14 days, a multi-sectoral, multistakeholder engagement be held with a view to charting the way forward on matters relating to the content of the bill as well as auxiliary issues raised in recent days on the need for austerity measures and strengthening our fight against corruption.""
During his Wednesday address, President Ruto also called for immediate austerity measures to reduce spending.
""I direct immediate further austerity measures to reduce expenditure, starting with the Executive Office of the President and extending to the entire executive arm of government,"" said President Ruto.
He stated that this would begin with the presidency and then spread to the executive branch of government.
""I direct that operational expenditure in the Presidency be reduced to remove allocations for the confidential vote, reduce travel budget, hospitality and purchase of motor vehicles, renovations and other expenditures.""

Irene Waithera is being held at Kerugoya police station after she was cornered by angry villagers, who accused her of threatening to kill her brother before setting his house on fire.
According to relatives, led by Peter Mwangi and Jane Muthoni, the suspect, Irene Waithera allegedly sent threatening messages to her brother for the better part of Thursday, before burning his house.
Police officers who took the suspect to the station said investigations had been launched and nobody was injured.

Ken Mugo and Mathew Ngatia, who are residents in the village, said more residents were drinking illicit brew and smoking bhang.
""Youths spend their days drinking as women do work themselves, some guarding their macadamia and their chicken as their husband and the youths are unable to do the work,"" the residents said.
Residents of Kawakara accused police officers of being complacent, adding that some had been compromised to be lenient with illicit brew makers.
Residents urged the government to intervene.

Naomi Osaka said Sunday she hopes to mark her daughter's first birthday by making a winning return to Wimbledon thanks to a helping hand from Novak Djokovic.
The Japanese superstar, a four-time Grand Slam champion and a former world number one, hasn't played at the All England Club since 2019.
Osaka takes on Diane Parry of France in her opener on Monday, the day before she celebrates daughter Shai's first birthday.
""She's one on Tuesday so it will be very exciting day,"" said the 26-year-old.
""It's been a great journey and I'm lucky and blessed to have happy girl with lots of energy. It's a dream to be here with her now.""
Osaka's four majors came on the hard courts of the US Open and Australian Open.
She made the third round at Wimbledon in 2017 and 2018, losing to former champions Venus Williams and Angelique Kerber respectively.
Her most recent appearance in 2019 was brief with a first round loss to Yulia Putintseva.
In order to improve her chances at this year's tournament, Osaka has sounded out seven-time Wimbledon champion Djokovic.
""I tried to slide on grass. I asked Novak how he did it. I have tried a few times but it has been scary. I think I may have to wait for the grass to get brown a little,"" she said.
""But he told me no matter if he falls he keeps getting up and doing it. He said I have to overcome the fear of getting hurt.""
Osaka, who only returned to the tour at the start of the year afer maternity leave, is ranked at 113 in the world and required a wild card to play at Wimbledon.
At the recent French Open, she gave world number one Iga Swiatek a mighty scare, holding a match point in their second round clash before the Pole prevailed.
Since then she made the quarter-finals of the grass-court tournament at 's-Hertogenbosch and pushed world number eight Zheng Qinwen to three sets in the opening round in Berlin.
""It's a little weird as I feel I have been playing really well this year but just not making a lot of quarter-finals,"" said Osaka.
""I feel that had I not played Iga, I could have gone a long way in Paris. I just need some luck.""
She added: ""I lost first round in Berlin, but I learned lot. I'm feeling pretty good about myself. People tell me I have game for grass.""

https://www.citizen.digital/news/road-to-damascus-moment-kenyan-politicians-shocking-change-of-tune-after-gen-z-uprising-n345209,"Road to Damascus moment? Kenyan politicians shocking change of tune after Gen Z uprising
Dubbed the 'Gen Z protests', the demonstrations started as calls for the rejection of the now-withdrawn Finance Bill 2024 which was proposing unbearable taxations for Kenyans amid a crippling economy.
Calls for scrapping the punitive tax laws the nation has buckling under became louder every time the young patriots hit the streets, many fronting the deeply-rotted corruption adopted by leaders and the blatant misappropriation of public funds.
Gen Z's sheer force finally forced President William Ruto to concede and say he would not append his signature on the unsavoury Bill which partially quelled the mounting rage among the youth.
By this time, around June 27, homes and businesses belonging to MPs who had voted in favour of the Bill were attacked and looted or torched. Legislators were threatened and they ran into hiding.
Parliament also went for a two-week recess allowing time for the shivering legislators.
A week later, the Senate held a plenary sitting and the mood inside the House seemed aphonic and abased. Senators suddenly seemed to have ameliorated their perspectives on governance and adopted ""sober talk"".
Taking the floor, Majority Leader Aaron Cheruiyot, who has been a fearless soldier of Ruto's tax policies, tendered a melancholic apology to Kenyans for the decisions he has made in his capacity that might have vexed citizens.
""I want to tender my unreserved apology to the country for either by commission or omission everything that I have contributed into getting us in the mess and the place that we are in,"" he said.
""I have reflected deeply the last few days and moved through my journey as an individual and asked myself very serious questions trying to wear the shoes of the ordinary citizens and how they feel at this particular time.""
Cheruiyot said that Senators now share a mutual perspective on the poor state of the nation, noting that the youth-led protests served as an awakening call for most Senate representatives.
""We sat somewhere, off camera, together and reasoned on what is it we can make as our contribution. We are deeply embarrassed that it has taken young children to point to us that you are naked as our leaders,"" he said.
""I realised that we live in extraordinary times and ordinary solutions that we had proposed in the past cannot work this time.""
What followed for an hours-long clobbering at the National Assembly as Senators accused MPs of being the proponents of graft in the country and having sustained the wastage of public funds.
Senators from the opposition and government joined forces in singing the same tune on cutting expenditure, upholding austerity measures and further throwing their fellow MPs under the political bus.
Senator Boni Khalwale called for a total abolishment of the offices of First Lady, Spouse of the Deputy President, Spouse of the Prime Cabinet Secretary and county first ladies.
He further criticized Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa and other politicians for their public display of wealth as Kenyans struggle with the biting cost of living.
Khalwale said politicians’ public display of opulence is among the issues angering Kenyans amid the ongoing anti-government protests.
“Hon. Didmus Barasa, take it easy; helicopters will not change your life,” Khalwale told the MP, who was recently reported to have acquired a multi-million-shilling chopper that he uses to attend public functions.
The call for accountability and cutting down on costs was further echoed by Senators Edwin Sifuna (Nairobi), Richard Onyonka (Kisii), and Enoch Wambua (Kitui).
""It does not make sense, so what you do. MPs, staff have to be honest with Kenyans. There are ways of reducing the expenditure in a manner that will reduce the burden on taxpayers,"" Sifuna said.
""I don't need all that money, even if I ran up and down the expressway for a year, I would never exhaust the amount. We must do this so that we demonstrate to the people that we are serious.""
The sanctity act in the Senate was hushed by Belgut MP Nelson Koech on Thursday, who said that the Senators were just hypocritical and they were wolves hiding behind sheep masks.
""What I watched in the Senate is hypocrisy that stinks to the highest heavens. People who are not honest, who are claiming that we've been receiving so much money because of the moment,"" said Koech speaking on Citizen TV.
""I live with these people, we are in parliament with them, I know their hearts. These people want money so badly.""
President Ruto was also forced to rescind his stand on the protests after he made a tough-sounding speech on the evening of June 25 which was met with heightened ridicule from the public.
In his speech, he did not mention the legislation that set off the protests and rather said that the “legitimate” protests against proposed tax increases were infiltrated and hijacked by “organized criminals” and that the security of the nation remains his priority.
""Freedom of assembly, demonstrations, and picketing by a section of law-abiding citizens was infiltrated and hijacked by a group of organized criminals. Most regrettably, today's attack on Kenya's constitutional order has resulted in the loss of lives also destruction of property,"" said Ruto.
""I have directed all the organs of our national security to deploy measures to thwart any attempt by dangerous criminals to undermine the security of our country.""
A day later, after temper heaped among dejected Kenyans, Ruto made a U-turn and made a second speech vowing to withdraw the Bill and engage the nation's ""sons and daughters"" in productive talks.
""It is necessary for us to have a conversation as a nation going forward. How do we manage the affairs of our country together? I will be proposing an engagement with the young people of our nation, our sons and daughters for us to listen to them.""
MPs have also bowed to the pressure as Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi even announced that he will be taking an indefinite hiatus from active politics.
Meanwhile, Ruto has vowed to heed some of the demands made by the vexed youth including scrapping unconstitutional offices, firing his advisors and significantly slashing expenditures for state officers.

The
Kenya National Para Boxing team, led by Emmanuel Yakhama and Evans Odhiambo,
finished second behind hosts Poland at the Seven Stars Para Boxing tournament held
in Warsaw.
Heavyweight
boxer, Odhiambo, lost two rounds to one against homeboy Nikodem Prządka, who
also represents his country in the discus throw.
“The
first challenge we encountered here is that their wheelchairs are very
different from the ones we use back home in Kenya. And also, these boxers don't
punch, they slap and we can also say that the judges favored the hosts and
lacked fairness,” said Odhiambo.
“But
we are also grateful to get this invitation because there is a lot that we have
learnt. When we return home, we will practice more to improve and we believe
that if they invite us next time, we will play better,” he added.
Team
captain and lightweight pugilist Yakhama lost his bout by three rounds to two
against Pawel Kaleta.
Yakhama
and Odhiambo hold the East Africa and Africa titles in their respective categories.
“I am
very grateful to the organizers of this competition for sending us this
invitation to participate in this competition. Poland has defeated us but I am
sure they have also realized that we as Kenyans are not far behind. We knew
that if the opponent slaps you, it will not count as a score, but we discovered
later that punches and slaps are the same thing. This could be the main reason
for our loss,” noted Yahkama.
The
team is expected to return back home on Wednesday.
“We will immediately go to
camp for training upon our return, just in case we receive an invitation to
another tournament,” said Yakhama.

Spain coach Luis de la Fuente said his team could have beaten
Georgia 9-1 as they eased through to the Euro 2024 quarter-finals on Sunday to
face hosts Germany.
La Roja fell behind through Robin Le Normand's own goal but
bounced back strongly to claim a 4-1 victory in Cologne and created several big
chances against the tournament's surprise package.
Rodri, Fabian Ruiz, Nico Williams and Dani Olmo struck for Spain,
while 16-year-old winger Lamine Yamal missed two clear openings which could
have seen him crowned the youngest ever Euros goal scorer.
""We're very happy because we know what it takes to be here,
that's been shown by what the other teams have gone through,"" De la Fuente
told Spanish television.
""(The result) was deceptive because it could have been 8-1 or
9-1. We had to suffer, counter-attacking is their weapon.
""They didn't manage to get a shot on target and we put ours
away, so we're very happy.""
Joint record three-time Euros champions Spain now face the
tournament's other form team, Germany, in the quarter-finals on Friday.
De la Fuente told reporters he expects a close game against the
hosts in Stuttgart.
""Germany is a great team, with great individuals of a high
level, some of the best in the world,"" said the 63-year-old.
""They are well organised and disciplined, but they will have
in front of them a very similar team, with a lot of commitment, well organised,
hard to overcome, very hungry, very ambitious.
""It will be a very balanced, even game and at this level, it
will be the details that determine it for one team or the other. We have to
keep working like we have been, and keeping focussing on our strengths and keep
improving -- we are not perfect.""
De la Fuente sang the praises of his players after they stayed
calm despite falling behind and produced 35 shots, while restricting Georgia to
four with none on target.
""I don't want to offend anyone, but I think we have the best
team and the best players. Does that mean we will win (the competition)? No,
but we will fight for it,"" added De la Fuente, who led Spain to Nations
League glory last year after an 11-year trophy drought.
""It doesn't guarantee anything, we know that, but we have
footballing strength with talent, quality, commitment, and players who are
buying in, and that's something very important.""
Yamal threatened throughout but despite another bright display
from the Barcelona winger, De la Fuente said he could still improve
significantly.
""He had a great game but he could have done much better,
taken his time in some moments -- we have to invite him to have more
calm,"" said the coach.
""But he is 16 and in a period of learning, and this game will
stand him in good stead for that.
""He
is lucky he's living through this so young and is surrounded by great players
who are helping him a lot.""

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/martinez-saves-messi-blushes-as-argentina-beat-ecuador-to-reach-copa-semis-n345252,"Martinez saves Messi blushes as Argentina beat Ecuador to reach Copa semis
Goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez was the hero, saving two penalties
and Lionel Messi's blushes as holders Argentina defeated Ecuador in a penalty
shoot-out to book their place in the Copa America semi-finals on Thursday.
A Lisandro Martinez header had put world champions Argentina 1-0
up ten minutes before half-time but Kevin Rodriguez headed in a stoppage-time
leveller for Ecuador, who had risen to the occasion in front of 69,456 fans at
Houston's NRG Stadium.
Messi missed the opening penalty, chipping against the bar, but
thanks to heroics from Martinez, Argentina recovered to win the shoot-out 4-2
and progress into the semi-finals where they will face the winner of Friday's
match between Venezuela and Canada.
Messi's 'panenka' miss brought back memories of his miss in the
shoot-out loss to Chile in the 2016 Copa final but luckily for him goalkeeper
Martinez was in the mood to repeat his own past.
He pulled off superb diving saves to deny Angel Mena and Alan
Minda and get his team in front before Nicolas Otamendi slotted home the
decisive fourth kick.
Martinez had saved three spot-kicks in a 3–2 penalty shootout
victory for Argentina over Colombia in the semi-final of the 2021 Copa America
and famously saved two in the World Cup final win against France in Qatar.
Ecuador were left crestfallen after a match in which they had
created enough opportunities to have won the game.
Felix Sanchez's team made a bright start, dominating the ball in
midfield and stretching the Argentine defence at times.
Moises Caicedo had an early opportunity, latching on to a header
from Enner Valencia, but his shot was tame and easily dealt with by Argentine
keeper Martinez.
Then Moises Caicedo threaded a clever pass through to the
impressive Jeremy Sarmiento but Martinez was out quick to save with an
outstretched foot and Kendry Paez blasted the loose ball over the bar.
Argentina gradually got a foothold in the game but it was not
until the 28th minute that they had their first opening when Enzo Fernandez
headed wide a Nahuel Molina cross from the right.
Seven minutes later, they had the lead however, Messi driving in a
corner which Alexis Mac Allister met at the near post with a flick-on and
Lisandro Martinez arrived with a powerful header that Ecuador keeper Alexander
Dominguez was unable to keep out.
Fernandez soon had a chance to double the lead but fired a
left-foot shot wide at the back post and Argentina went in at the break with a
single goal lead.
Ecuador were given a lifeline in the 62nd minute when Rodrigo De
Paul was ruled to have handled inside the box but Valencia's penalty struck the
outside of the post.
But in stoppage time, Ecuador stunned the 15-times Copa champions
when Kevin Rodriguez glanced in a header from a John Yeboah cross.
There was a VAR review, looking at whether Jordy Caicedo had
interfered in an offside position at the back post but the goal stood.
Moments later Jordy Caicedo had a great chance to win the game but
he glanced a left-wing cross wide from a great, central position.
That meant the drama of a penalty shoot-out and the chance to
upset the defending champions slipt away.

Kenya Police Bullets
Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chris Oguso has said that they will use their
end of the season match against Bunyore Starlets as a friendly clash ahead of
the CAF Champions League/Cecafa qualifiers tournament slated for August in Ethiopia
The law enforcers are
poised for coronation on Wednesday June 26, 2024 as the 2023/24 season
culminates.
The match against
Bunyore which was earlier scheduled to be played at Mumboha Stadium in Vihiga
has been moved to Mamboleo Stadium in Kisumu.
""I congratulate the
ladies for winning the title without conceding a single match going to our
final match to us will be as a training being that we already won the league
earlier enough.
‘Our first Cecafa match
is slated for August 17 and it's not that far, we need to hit the preparation
camp immediately after the league ends.
“I can say the title win
has been made possible due to proper coordination of the technical bench head
by Coach Beldine Odemba.
“Also the Kenya Police
Services has given the girls maximum support and we are looking forward to
continue with the same spirit ahead of Cecafa and the next season""
This is their first
title since they adopted a new name from Thika Queens, with their stellar
campaign seeing amass an impressive 46 points from 21 matches so far.
The second place has
been secured by Vihiga Queens while Ulinzi Starlets settled for third place.
Gaspo Women and Trans
Nzoia Falcons have already been relegated, while Soccer Assassins and Zetech
Sparks are vying to avoid the axe.
Currently, Zetech Sparks
are three points ahead of Soccer Assassins and have an inferior goal
difference.
With no more games to
play, they hope Soccer Assassins do not win their match at Wolves Den, Kajiado.

The Bankers hammered the students 61-46 in Game Five of the five-game series.
The two sides which had tied 2-2 in the first four games of the series, entered the match with high tension each looking for the ticket with the first half ending in a draw.
Equity will face defending champions Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) in the final starting next weekend.
Zetech started the game on a high note winning first quarter comfortably 21-09 but their hopes didn't live to it's expectations as Equity roared in the second quarter winning 19-07 as the game went to halftime break with scores standing at 28 Ups.
After the break, the bankers came out much stronger, using their experience to milk out the students' energy as they won the third quarter 17-06 before winding up with another 16-12 win in the last quarter as the game ended 61-46 at the final buzzer in their favour.
Maryann Nyagaki, Betty Kananu and Jemimah Knight dropped a combined 34 points for the Bankers while Naomi Bosibori was Zetech's shining star dropping a game-high 16 points as Maureen Bosibori added 12.
Equity Hawks head coach Benson Oluoch lauded his girls for the well done job for their achievement.
""I think coming back twice to tie the series, the team showed some resilience. We did extremely well especially in the third quarter, our shooters did an amazing job.
It was about defense and team work which won the game for us despite starting off badly where my players failed to understand our opponents,"" Oluoch said.
Despite the loss, Zetech Sparks head coach Maurice Obilo has applauded his girls for their efforts even after missing four key players .
""My girls have really amazed me on how they can step up in the whole series as we missed four of our main players who are really important. Those available really stepped up and pushed Equity to the fifth game and to me that was a really amazing job,"" Obilo said.

The Makueni County Makindu Ward MCA went missing on Saturday morning after he was allegedly kidnapped by unknown assailants and forced into a car headed towards Mombasa from Makindu.
In a Monday statement, the Wiper Democratic Party claimed that the MCA was kidnapped by unidentified police officers.
“The Wiper Democratic Movement (WDM) Party unequivocally condemns the abduction of Hon. Wambua, as a gross violation of human rights and equivalent to arbitrary arrests and enforced disappearance as prohibited under Article 29 of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010, “ stated the party.
“We demand that Hon. Wambua be released immediately and returned to his family in Makindu, Makueni County. We also demand that the government immediately end these illegal actions and release all others who have been arbitrarily arrested.
This follows a series of abductions, primarily targeting outspoken opponents of the 2024 finance bill and the government.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/govt-set-for-budget-cuts-as-president-ruto-signs-appropriations-bill-2024-n344874,"Gov’t set for budget cuts as President Ruto signs Appropriations Bill 2024
President William Ruto has signed the
Appropriations Bill, 2024 into law to allow for the continuity of government
operations for the next financial year after Finance Bill, 2024 was withdrawn.
In
a statement to newsrooms on Friday, the President said the Appropriations Bill would
be critical to ensure the running of critical government services in accordance
with the law before the Treasury prepares a supplementary budget.
The
Head of State explained that the Treasury will now be required to prepare a
supplementary estimate which would reduce government expenditure by the amount
of revenue that was expected to be generated by the rejected Finance Bill,
2024.
“On
Wednesday 26th June 2024, I declined to sign the Finance Bill 2024 consequently
sending a memorandum to the National Assembly rejecting all clauses of the Bill…Articles
221 and 222 of the Constitution require that the Appropriations Bill be
assented to by the 30th of June every year to guarantee the continuity of
government operations, especially in providing critical services,” he stated.
“I
have therefore assented to the Appropriations Bill 2024 and instructed the
National Treasury to immediately prepare supplementary estimates to reduce
expenditure by the amount of revenue that was expected to be generated by the
rejected Finance Bill 2024.”
The
President said the Finance Bill was expected to generate Ksh.346 billion, and
the money will now be borne by all levels of government.
“With
respect to the National Government, the reduction will be borne by the Executive,
the Legislature, the Judiciary, and our constitutional commissions,” he noted.
President
Ruto also referred the County Allocation and Revenue Bill, which was based on
expected revenues from the rejected Finance Bill, back to Parliament for
reduction accordingly.
He
at the same time directed the National Treasury to immediately submit to
Parliament amendments to the Division of Revenue Act 2024 to reflect on the
reduced revenues occasioned by the rejected Finance Bill.
According
to the President's directive, all accounting officers are expected to
ensure that only critical and essential services are funded, using no more than
15% of the budget, until the supplement budget is approved.
Ruto
verbally withdrew the contentious Bill on
Wednesday, sparking debates on whether he had the constitutional powers to do
so, given that Parliament went on recess earlier in the day and would resume
regular sittings on Tuesday, July 23.
According to
clause 6 of the Constitution, if the President refuses to sign a Bill and fails
to return it to Parliament within 14 days, the Bill will be considered law, and
as such, Ruto had to officially initiate the process by writing to Speaker Moses
Wetangula.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/kisii-assistant-chief-speaks-out-after-being-accused-of-shaming-school-girl-to-death-n345514,"Kisii: Assistant Chief speaks out after being accused of shaming school girl to death
In an interview with local digital channels, Osano denied shaming the Form One student for allegedly refusing to go to school, leading to the girl dying by suicide.
The beleaguered administrator narrated that he tried to take the girl back to school with the help of local elders, and that at no point did he beat her or strip and shame her in front of her parents.
""I am devastated by the reports that have been circulated out there. I did not do what the deceased's family is accusing me of. Good thing is I was with the Nyumba Kumi elders when we called the girl and tried to take her back to school, as we have done with other students who dropped out of school in this area,"" Osano defended himself.
""I am a state officer, there is no way I could do something like that. The family of the girl is not happy that I have been fighting the illicit brew it's selling to the locals. That girl was not going to school because her parents insisted that she helps them to prepare the brew, which the government is against,"" Osano further said.
He said on the material day, he called the girl to his office together with other students from the area and tried to take them back to school. He says he even negotiated with the school principal to allow the students attend classes as their parents hustled for school fees.
Osano points an accusing finger at his competitors for the position of assistant chief, saying they are unhappy that he bagged the seat ahead of them, and now they are using the unfortunate incident to tarnish his name.
""The good thing is the matter is now in the hands of the DCI and truly I believe justice will be served. The good thing is there were people present who can corroborate my side of the story. At no point did I shame the girl, neither did I beat her father as he claims. I'm a church deacon, I can't strip a lady, not even my wife, forcefully,"" Osano denied.
The incident, which occurred in Amabuko Village, Nyaribari Masaba, Kisii County, has sparked widespread public outrage over the conduct of the uniformed government officer.
The tragic event took a devastating turn when the young girl later committed suicide, leaving behind a poignant note expressing her shame after being publicly undressed and flogged by the chief for being at home instead of in school.
The family of Jared Omari, visibly distraught, gathered outside their grass-thatched house in deep reflection following the sudden death of their first-born daughter.
The deceased's mother, Joyce Bonareri, explained that her daughter had returned home to collect personal belongings, including sanitary towels, before intending to return to school. She had assumed the administrator's summons were to assist her with these needs.
The body of the deceased was transferred to Ichuni Hospital morgue pending an autopsy. The family, amidst their profound grief, has appealed to authorities to thoroughly investigate the matter and ensure justice is served, attributing the tragic ordeal to their impoverished circumstances.

Kenya braced for a nationwide strike Tuesday in response to a call by youth protesters for a countrywide shutdown, as opposition to the government's proposed tax hikes gathers momentum.
The mainly Gen-Z-led demonstrations have taken President William Ruto's government by surprise, with the Kenyan leader saying over the weekend that he was ready to speak with the protesters.
Discontent over the already high cost of living spiralled into nationwide rallies last week, sparked by the Ruto administration's proposed tax hikes in the annual finance bill, which parliament must vote on by June 30.
The protests were mostly peaceful, as Ruto noted Sunday in his first public comments on the demonstrations. But the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) watchdog and rights groups said that two people had died following Thursday's rallies.
Protest organisers called for the police to be held accountable and reiterated their demands for the finance bill to be scrapped in its entirety.
""We're past the talking stage and won't be silenced. We demand an end to police violence, respect for our constitutional rights, and the freedom to speak up without fear of arrest or harm,"" Hanifa Adan told AFP Sunday.
Several organisations, including Amnesty International Kenya, said at least 200 people were wounded in the protests in Nairobi.
""The country stands at a crossroads,"" Amnesty's Kenya chapter said in a statement Monday.
""Despite mass arrests and injuries, the protests have continued to grow, emphasising the public's widespread discontent.""
Amnesty added that the movement leaves government and police at a ""critical juncture, where the escalation of force could lead to more fatalities and legal repercussions.""
Rights watchdogs have accused the authorities of abducting protesters in violation of the law.
""These abductions are intended to intimidate protesters planning to attend future peaceful demonstrations aimed at pressuring MPs to reject the bill,"" the Kenya Human Rights Commission (KHRC) said Monday.
""These abductions, mostly occurring at night, are conducted by police officers in civilian clothes and unmarked cars,"" KHRC added, calling for the ""unconditional release of all abductees.""
The police have not responded to requests from AFP for comment on the allegations.
In addition to a strong social media campaign and street rallies, the protesters have deployed unconventional tactics, including asking bars to stop playing music at midnight on the weekend as partygoers burst into chants saying: ""Ruto must go"" and ""Reject finance bill.""
Small numbers of Kenyans also protested at the weekend at several embassies abroad, including in Washington and Paris, according to TV images, organisers and social media.
The protests have also drawn support from some Anglican and Catholic church leaders.
During Sunday mass, the Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops chairman Archbishop Maurice Muhatia urged the government to take the matter seriously, ""and not be in denial"".
The cash-strapped government agreed last week to roll back several tax increases.
But Ruto's administration still intends to raise some taxes, saying they are necessary for filling the state coffers and cutting reliance on external borrowing.
Kenya has a huge debt mountain whose servicing costs have ballooned because of a fall in the value of the local currency over the last two years, making interest payments on foreign-currency loans more expensive.
The tax hikes will pile further pressure on Kenyans, with well-paid jobs remaining out of reach for many young people.
After the government agreed to scrap levies on bread purchases, car ownership and financial and mobile services, the treasury warned of a budget shortfall of 200 billion shillings ($1.56 billion).
The government now intends to target an increase in fuel prices and export taxes to fill the void left by the changes, a move critics say will make life more expensive in a country already saddled with high inflation.
Kenya has one of the most dynamic economies in East Africa but a third of its 52 million people live in poverty.

In a statement issued on Monday, the DCI stated that its Imaging and Acoustic Unit, housed at the National Forensic Laboratory, had recovered numerous CCTV footages in which several people were caught committing felonious acts under the guise of peaceful protests.
""Whereas some have already been arrested and arraigned in various courts today, more are still out there on the streets waiting for other opportune times to strike again,"" the DCI said, urging members of public to help in identifyings suspects caught on CCTV.
""We can flush them from amongst our numbers because they do not share the principles that define what we stand for, and more so for the sake of those who did not deserve to lose their only means of livelihood in this manner.""
Several businesses were looted during the protests, with President Ruto claiming on Sunday that intelligence reports revealed heavy mobilisation goons who raided parliament, with some targeting the armoury and the mausoleum.
President Ruto announced on Wednesday that a bill containing contentious tax hikes would be ""withdrawn,"" dramatically reversing course after more than 20 people were killed in clashes with police and parliament was ransacked by protesters opposing the legislation.
The initially peaceful demonstrations were sparked last week by the 2024 finance bill -- which politicians passed Tuesday afternoon -- and took Ruto's administration by surprise as rallies gathered momentum across the country.
However, the Gen-Z-led protests turned violent on Tuesday, when police fired live bullets at the crowds outside parliament, causing the complex to be ransacked and partially burned.
""I concede and therefore I will not sign the 2024 finance bill and it shall subsequently be withdrawn,"" Ruto told a press briefing.
""The people have spoken,"" he said.
""I will be proposing an engagement with the young people of our nation, our sons and daughters, for us to listen to them,"" he said, in a marked shift from his late-night address Tuesday when he likened some of the demonstrators to ""criminals"".

(Photo by LUIS TATO / AFP)
Hundreds of protesters gathered in Kenya's capital Nairobi on Thursday, with police firing rubber bullets and tear gas as turnout by demonstrators dropped sharply, following deadly clashes earlier this week.
A day after President William Ruto caved in to demands by young protesters to withdraw a deeply unpopular tax hike bill, small groups of demonstrators took to the streets, calling for the Kenyan leader's removal.
The scattered crowds, numbering a few hundred according to AFP journalists at the scene, made their way to Nairobi's business district as soldiers were deployed and police in anti-riot gear blocked access along roads leading to Ruto's office at State House and parliament.
Isolated scuffles broke out between some stone-throwing demonstrators and officers who fired rubber bullets and tear gas, arresting at least seven people, AFP journalists saw.
After unprecedented scenes broadcast live saw parliament ransacked on Tuesday, with police opening fire on protesters, Ruto made a surprise U-turn on the tax hikes and called for dialogue with young Kenyans.
Cephas, a 24-year-old student who only gave his first name, told AFP that Ruto's decision to scrap the tax increases had come too late, adding ""it's not about the bill, it's him. We want him out of office.""
He said many protesters had chosen not to show up on Thursday ""because they are fearing for their lives.""
Several women, who had attended previous protests, told AFP they had decided to stay away on Thursday.
""It's looking scary out there,"" a 26-year-old woman protester told AFP on condition of anonymity, explaining her decision to stay home.
AFP journalists said most of the demonstrators attending Thursday's rallies were men.
Many shops remained shuttered as traders worried about further unrest.
Hundreds of protesters also rallied in the port city of Mombasa and the opposition bastion of Kisumu, local TV showed, with some blocking roads and lighting fires in the lakeside city.
The protests -- led largely by young, Gen-Z Kenyans -- kicked off last week and caught the authorities off-guard, as Ruto's government ricocheted between taking a tough line on the unrest and calling for dialogue.
But on Wednesday, the Kenyan leader declined to sign the increases into law and withdrew the bill.
""The people have spoken,"" he said, adding that he would seek ""engagement with the young people of our nation"".
But protesters said they would still rally in memory of those killed in the demonstrations, criticising Ruto's dramatic reversal as a case of too little, too late.
The state-funded Kenya National Commission on Human Rights counted 22 dead nationwide -- 19 in Nairobi alone -- and 300 injured in the aftermath of Tuesday's protests, vowing an investigation.
Shops were largely closed in Nairobi's business district on Thursday.
""We cannot take risk,"" said Joe, an employee in a perfume store, as he prepared to head home.
""Why did they have to kill these young people? This bill is not worth people dying,"" the 30-year-old said.
""We are in uncharted waters.""
The unrest has alarmed the international community, with Washington calling on Kenya to respect the right to peaceful protest and the UN urging ""accountability"" for the bloodshed.
Rights watchdogs have accused the authorities of abducting protesters.
The police have not responded to AFP requests for comment.
Ruto rolled back some of the tax measures last week, prompting the treasury to warn of a budget shortfall of 200 billion shillings ($1.6 billion).
Ruto said Wednesday that withdrawing the bill would mean a significant hole in funding for development programmes to help farmers and teachers, among others.
The cash-strapped government had said previously that the increases were necessary to service Kenya's debt of some 10 trillion shillings ($78 billion), equal to roughly 70 percent of GDP.
Ruto's administration has been under pressure from the International Monetary Fund, which has called for fiscal reforms in order to access crucial funding.

Naivas FC head coach Collins Omondi has backed his side to bounce back and overturn their first-leg defeat to Sofapaka in the FKF Premier League promotion playoff.
Sofapaka narrowly defeated Naivas 1-0 courtesy of a goal by in-form marksman Jacob Onyango in the dying minutes of the clash played on Saturday at the Police Sacco Stadium.
Coach Omondi has emphasized the need to capitalize on scoring opportunities in the upcoming match.
While reflecting on their performance in that match, Omondi rued profligacy in front of goal, terming it an area they need to improve on ahead of the return match.
“By bad luck, we conceded a goal in the last minute, but these are mistakes that happen in football, and we understand that. We created a lot of chances, but unfortunately, we didn't score. My team got carried away, but we will correct that to ensure we find the net in the next game,” noted Omondi.
Coach Omondi emphasized the need to capitalize on scoring opportunities in the upcoming match if they are to prevail at the end of the two-game series.
“So far, it's a disadvantage to us, but there is a second leg and an away goal aggregate, it means when we go to the second leg, we must secure a win. My players did not always make the right decisions in this match, but I will address and correct these aspects for the next game,” he added.
The return leg will be on Sunday, July 14, 2024,
at the Dandora Stadium, where Naivas will be seeking redemption and promotion
to the top-tier league for the first time in their history, while Sofapaka will
be aiming to retain their top-flight status next season.

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/southgate-rues-unusual-atmosphere-after-englands-night-on-the-boos-n344697,"Southgate rues 'unusual' atmosphere after England's night on the boos
Gareth Southgate bemoaned the
""unusual"" environment around England after the Three Lions boss was
pelted with cups while his players were booed off following Tuesday's
lacklustre 0-0 draw with Slovenia at Euro 2024.
Southgate's side finished top of Group C despite
a third successive underwhelming performance that was greeted with disdain by
their fans in Cologne.
While Slovenia's players and fans celebrated
wildly at the other end of the stadium after reaching the knockout stage,
Southgate and his players were greeted with jeers when they trudged towards the
England supporters.
Southgate was targeted by beer cups that missed
the Three Lions boss but clearly left an impression on his psyche.
Coming after several days of criticism from
former England players following a drab 1-1 draw with Denmark, the latest flop
by Southgate's team threatens to create an even more toxic atmosphere as they
head into the last 16.
Pleading with England's fans to create a
positive vibe around the team, Southgate said: ""I've not seen any other
team qualify and receive a similar reaction. I'm very proud of the players for
the way they handle it.
""The players kept composure in a game when
they have come into it with a really challenging environment. It's taken me
back to days when I was playing for England.
""I'm not going to back away from it. I
understand the narrative towards me, better for me than it being towards them.
It's creating an unusual atmosphere to operate in.""
Southgate claimed England's relative success in
his eight-year reign, which includes a runners-up finish at Euro 2020 and a
World Cup semi-final appearance in 2018, had created expectations that his team
are currently failing to match.
- 'I'm not going to back
down' -
""I think probably expectation,"" he
said when quizzed about why the mood in the stands had changed.
""We have made England fun again over the
last six years. It's been enjoyable for the players and we have to be very
careful that it stays that way.""
Southgate, whose contract expires at the end of
this year, has hinted he will leave the England job if they don't win the
Euros.
But he was adamant he remains in a positive
mind-frame despite the barrage of negativity surrounding England's spluttering
campaign.
""I'm in a really good place. I'm asking the
players to be fearless and I'm not going to back down from thanking the
fans,"" he said.
""The fans were exceptional with the team in
the second half, that makes such a difference.
""It's so important they stay with the team
no matter how they feel about me. I've been around England for 20 years. I've
seen it. I get it.""
The toothless Three Lions have won just two of
their last eight games and have netted only twice in their three matches at the
Euros.
But Southgate was grasping for signs of
improvement in the Slovenia game.
""After what happened after the last game (against
Denmark), I didn't think we would be free and liberated and score six
goals,"" he said.
""But we have shown some encouraging signs.
We pinned them back and had wave after wave of attack.
""Of course we would have loved a couple of
goals. It's definitely an improvement on the last game. We have to build from
here.""
Having won the group, England could have a
significantly easier path to the final than several of their title rivals.
But, understandably, Southgate was in no mood to
look ahead.
""It's important to win the group because
you control your own destiny,"" he said.
""It doesn't mean you
get an easier tie but people can't accuse us of ending up with a tougher draw
when we didn't win the group.""

Head coach Elijah Mringe said they have what it takes to deliver medals even as he praised the organisers for the invitation adding that more competitions abroad will expose his athletes to international events which will make them better.
“They have mastered the art very well in the time that we have been in training and I am sure we will make Kenya proud.”
His sentiments were echoed by team captain Elijah Yakhama.
“We are set for the games and we have studied our opponents and we know how we will handle them during the matches.”
Mringie, a former boxer, will coach heavyweight Evans Absalom Odhiambo and flyweight Emanuel Agavihi Yakhama in Poland’s capital city Warsaw in an event dubbed the Seven Stars Para boxing Night that will be held at the Podlaska Arena on June 29.
Mringie has been taking his crew through para boxing paces at the YMCA Hall in Shauri Moyo Nairobi.

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/kenyan-runner-cherono-banned-seven-years-for-doping-n345632,"Kenyan runner Cherono banned seven years for doping
Published on: July 10, 2024 11:47 (EAT)
Kenyan marathon runner Lawrence Cherono has been handed a seven-year ban for breaching doping rules, the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) announced Wednesday.
The 35-year-old runner, who won the Boston and Chicago marathons in 2019, provided an out-of-competition urine sample in May 2022 which revealed the presence of the prohibited substance trimetazidine.
""The AIU has banned Lawrence Cherono (Kenya) for 7 years from 16 July, 2022 for presence/use of a prohibited substance (trimetazidine), tampering or attempted tampering with any part of doping control,"" the AIU said in a statement.
Cherono's ban has been backdated to July 2022, when his provisional suspension began, meaning the Kenyan will be unable to compete until 2029.
The positive test earned the runner a four-year ban, plus an additional four years for ""submitting misleading, forged/falsified information"", the AIU indicated.
The total eight-year ban was reduced by one year due to Cherono's ""early admission and acceptance of (the) sanction"".
Kenya and its long-distance runners have been the source of a large number of doping cases in recent years. In April 2023, the AIU denounced large-scale doping in the country.
Trimetazidine is a blood flow booster known commonly as TMZ and was also detected in Russian skater Kamila Valieva during the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.
The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) came under pressure in April after it was revealed 23 Chinese swimmers tested positive for trimetazidine ahead of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.
WADA's decision on the matter was that the swimmers were allowed to compete after accepting China's findings that they had ingested it unwittingly from food during a meet in late 2020 and early 2021.

Speaking during the firm’s 78th Annual General Meeting held on Wednesday, Sanlam Kenya Group Managing Director Dr Nyamemba Patrick Tumbo said the business plan will provide a growth platform under a restructured financial management strategy.
In the financial year that ended December 2023, Dr Tumbo said, Sanlam Kenya recorded a loss after tax of Ksh.127 million from a profit before tax of Ksh.243 million, necessitating the formulation of the business plan.
The decline in earnings, he explained, was due to the prevailing high interest rates leading to increased finance costs.
However, the firm’s subsidiary Sanlam Life Insurance Limited recorded a profit after tax of Ksh.534 million, representing a 15% growth from the Ksh.464 million restated profit after tax recorded in the prior year.
Sanlam General Insurance Limited also recorded a profit after tax of Ksh.123 million, a significant improvement from the prior year’s restated loss of Ksh.36 million after tax.
“As part of the business recovery plan, Sanlam Kenya PLC was paid a dividend of Ksh.150 million in 2023 and a further dividend of Ksh.400 million paid in April 2024 from its subsidiary Sanlam Life Insurance Limited,” Dr Tumbo said.
Strategic efforts have also been activated to sustain Sanlam General Insurance Limited’s profitability. The subsidiary returned to profitability in 2023, posting Ksh.123 million in after-tax profits, affirming its ability to continue as a going concern. The subsidiary is now in a net asset position of Ksh.193 million, up from Ksh.71 million posted in 2022.
""At Sanlam Kenya, we are dedicated to improving capital efficiency and digitising key business processes to build a resilient business and provide a competitive customer value proposition to the satisfaction of all our stakeholders. This will increase financial inclusion and enhance access to our insurance products and services."" Dr Tumbo also stated.
“We are deliberate in our efforts to establish partnerships in order to achieve shared objectives of sustainability, financial inclusivity and responsible leadership practices.""

In a statement issued on Thursday, CS Namwamba stated that NOCK was given the daunting task of following a Preparatory and Management Committee (PMC) to iron out logistics ahead of the Paris competitions.
NOCK has been tasked with compiling a finalised list of the athletes, officials, and medics who will be travelling, as well as detailing each member's specific role.
""The delegation to be kept at the barest minimum as directed by myself and affirmed by the PMC. The priority is athletes, their coaches and medics,"" said Namwamba.
The Olympics committee was also tasked with providing full details of the trip's budget, including the actual number of qualified athletes, a revised scale of allowances, and athlete rewards while remaining within the ministry's austerity guidelines.
NOCK will also need to provide a detailed report on the process, status, and cost of Team Kenya's ceremonial, training, and competition kits.
""We wish Team Kenya good health and great success as they fly our national flag on the world's grandest sporting stage,"" he added.
Namwamba has come under intense public pressure, particularly from renowned content creator Dennis Ombachi, who is concerned that the CS will include tens of unnecessary hangers-on on the trip.
Ombachi has pledged to devote all of his energies to the CS in order to hold the ministry accountable for its actions.
To quell the growing clamour, Namwamba told Ombachi that he was willing to host him to discuss the issues raised with the goal of streamlining the ministry.
""My joy is the growth of sports in Kenya as a key economic driver, and the sustainable success of sportsmen and women. I would be glad to host you, and many others, on a day of your choice, for a public forum where we would, foremost, listen to you all, before we share on the work of the ministry, since I took over, and the vision that I have for the Ministry,"" Namwamba wrote on X.
""It would be great having you, and many others, as accountability partners in this journey. Waiting to hear on When and Where. X or the Ministry?""
Despite his efforts to calm the masses and invite them to the table, Kenyans have refused to rest until the list is made public, with some even going to court to demand it.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/43-sentenced-to-life-for-terror-links-in-uae-mass-trial-n345616,"43 sentenced to life for 'terror' links in UAE mass trial
Government critics and human rights activists were among the 84 defendants brought before the Abu Dhabi Federal Court of Appeal, most of whom have been in jail since a similar trial of 94 people in 2013, according to rights groups.
The Abu Dhabi court ""sentenced 43 defendants to life imprisonment for the crime of creating, establishing, and managing a terrorist organisation"" linked to the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, the official WAM news agency said.
Ten others were jailed for 10-15 years, WAM said, with one defendant acquitted and 24 cases ruled inadmissible. It did not give details of the remaining cases.
Defendants can still appeal the verdicts before the Federal Supreme Court.
The trial, which kicked off in December, has been condemned by rights groups and United Nations experts who accuse the oil-rich Gulf monarchy of cracking down on dissent.
Most of the defendants have already been in prison for more than a decade since the ""UAE 94"" trial 11 years ago, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW) and Amnesty International.
But UAE authorities say the latest charges are ""materially distinct"" from those brought in 2013, which did not include accusations of financing a ""terrorist organisation"".
- 'Violent events' -
The UAE has not named the 84 defendants but the Emirates Detainees Advocacy Center, a UK-based watchdog, has identified more than 70 people, most of them already imprisoned.
The latest verdict makes a ""mockery of justice"", said Joey Shea, HRW's UAE researcher, calling it ""another nail in the coffin for the UAE's nascent civil society"".
Among those sentenced to life in prison is Emirati academic Nasser bin Ghaith who has been held since August 2015 over social media posts, according to Shea.
Renowned human rights defender Ahmed Mansoor who has been held since 2017 is also likely among those convicted, though the details of his sentence remain unclear, Shea said.
Amnesty International called it a ""shameless parody of justice,"" alleging fair trial violations.
""Trying 84 Emiratis at once, including 26 prisoners of conscience and well-known human rights defenders is a scarcely disguised exercise in punishing dissenters,"" said Devin Kenney, Amnesty's UAE Researcher.
The UAE has denied any wrongdoing.
WAM said the court had ""guaranteed the defendants all their rights"".
The report said they were trying to ""create and replicate violent events"" that would have left ""dead and injured in the squares and streets"".
- 'Deeply regressive' -
The UAE, a federation of seven absolute monarchies, prohibits criticism of its rulers and any speech that is deemed to create or encourage social unrest.
Defamation as well as verbal and written insults, whether published or made privately, are crimes punishable by fines and imprisonment.
In 2012, in the wake of the so-called Arab Spring revolts across the Middle East, the UAE launched a spate of arrests and prosecutions targeting dozens of Emirati dissidents who demanded political reform.
About 60 of the ""UAE 94"" put on trial then remain behind bars for alleged links to the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist movement that is outlawed in the Gulf state.
In a letter sent to UAE authorities in January, independent UN experts said they were concerned that the latest proceedings against the 84 defendants reflect ""a broader pattern of suppression of dissent and civil society in the UAE"".
They questioned ""alleged irregularities"" such as ""the use of torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment to extract forced confessions"".
Ben Saul, the UN's special rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism, said the latest charges ""relate to the same conduct for which many of these defendants were tried the first time around a decade ago"".
The trial was a ""deeply regressive step"" and a ""terrible example of the misuse of counter-terrorism measures against civil society"", he told an expert panel hosted by the Geneva Press Club in March.
Last week, HRW said many of the defendants have been kept incommunicado for at least a year and have reported abuses including physical assault, lack of access to medicine, incessant loud music and forced nudity.
The wealthy country's allies, including the United States, Britain and the European Union, should speak out about the ""unfair mass trial"", HRW said.
""Emirati authorities have long used their country's economic and security relationships to prevent criticism of its rights record, but rarely, if ever, has the silence from its allies been so deafening,"" said HRW's Shea.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/united-nations-african-union-condemn-violence-in-kenyas-protests-n344683,"United Nations, African Union condemn violence in Kenya's protests
In a statement on Wednesday, Guterres urged Kenyan authorities to pave way for peaceful demonstrations to avert further harm and death of young Kenyans.
""I am deeply saddened by the reports of deaths and injuries - including of journalists and medical personnel - connected to protests and street demonstrations in Kenya,"" he said.
""I urge the Kenyan authorities to exercise restraint, and call for all demonstrations to take place peacefully.""
The same was echoed by the African Union Commission (AUC) chairperson Moussa Faki who urged stakeholders to exercise calm and welcome constructive dialogue to address the contentious issues that led to the protests.
""The Chairperson reiterates the total solidarity of the African Union with the Government and People of Kenya and exhorts them to maintain peace, security and stability in the country,"" said Faki.
An unconfirmed number of people were shot dead during Tuesday's mass protests and many were left nursing gunshot wounds after Anti-Riot Police Unit (ATPU) officers opened live rounds of ammunition.
Amnesty International said that over 31 people were injured and five people were shot dead as at 6:36pm on Tuesday.
Protesters breached Parliament buildings and vandalised the premises while the majority maintained that they were marching peacefully.
Parliamentarians were evacuated soon after the chaos erupted as countable bodies of the protesters were seen lying on Parliament Road.
In a late-night national address, President William Ruto described the breach of parliament as treasonous, vowing to crack down on the 'organisers and financiers of the protests.
According to President Ruto, it is inconceivable that ""criminals posing as peaceful protesters"" can terrorise people, elected representatives, and institutions and expect to get away with it.
""We must isolate crime from democratic expression and separate criminals from people exercising their freedom of expression and divergent opinion,"" he added.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/nigerias-bushmeat-consumption-comes-under-scrutiny-n345536,"Nigeria's bushmeat consumption comes under scrutiny
Following last week’s World Zoonoses Day celebrations, Nigeria's bush meat consumption comes under scrutiny due to the associated health risks.
Abuja-based civil servant Barnabas Bagudu among the 45% of Nigerians who consume bushmeat frequently, despite being aware of the potential risks. His personal favorites include antelope, rabbit, grasscutter, and alligator.
Bagudu emphasizes bushmeat's unique taste and cultural significance.
""I like bushmeat so much that if I see it anywhere, I like to eat it, mostly antelope and rabbit. Since it is from bush, it's blessed by God naturally, more than the one that we trained at home,"" he said.
Bushmeat is also a thriving trade for many, like Evelyn Agbo, a seller of various types of bushmeat for over a decade.
She draws a huge patronage across Abuja, Nigeria's capital, with antelope being her bestseller.
Agbo explains the preparation process.
""When I get the bushmeat, I dress it with salt and heat over fire with firewood until it is dried. I could do this for two days because if it's not dry, flies will perch on it and attract diseases,"" she said.
The World Health Organization states that about 60% of all infectious diseases are zoonotic, passing from animals to humans.
Nigeria has a high prevalence of zoonotic pathogens like Ebola, tuberculosis, and Lassa fever.
Abuja-based public health expert Ejike Orij warns about bushmeat consumption amid a fragile healthcare system.
""So, if for any reason that animal is infected and then it is now killed and served to humans in bats and in restaurant, that's how the transmission starts,"" he said.
The theme of the 2024 World Zoonoses Day was awareness and prevention of zoonotic diseases.
In Nigeria, efforts to promote safer bushmeat consumption practices remain low.
Orji stresses the need to ramp up awareness.
""There has been a lot of public education and community engagement by government on the issue of bushmeat, especially when there was an epidemic of lassa fever...it's just to spread the awareness especially to the people who prepare it,"" he said.
While bushmeat is a top delicacy in Nigeria, the need for safer consumption practices is urgent.
Public health experts urge Nigerians to explore domestic protein sources like chicken and to increase public awareness to mitigate risks.

According to Duale, the deployment of KDF soldiers was in response to ongoing violent protests in various parts of the Republic of Kenya, which have resulted in the destruction and breaching of critical infrastructure.
""The Kenya Defence Forces is deployed on the 25th June, 2024 in support of the National Police Service in response to the security emergency caused by the ongoing violent protests in various parts of the Republic of Kenya resulting in destruction and broaching of critical infrastructure,"" the gazette notice reads.

The Head of State will, according to a State House communique, address the press at 9pm on Tuesday.
Early Tuesday, Kenyan protesters broke through parliament barricades on Tuesday and entered the complex, where lawmakers were debating contentious tax hike proposals that have sparked widespread outrage.
According to Amnesty International Kenya, hundreds of protesters broke through police barriers outside parliament in Nairobi, with police firing live rounds and injuring ""many"" people.
A section of parliament that houses offices was also set on fire as protesters stormed the buildings, accompanied by heavy gunfire from police officers battling the defiant mob.
Protesters who have rallied against the contentious Bill, which was passed by the House on Tuesday, have been picketing for the past week, arguing that if passed, the Bill will burden an already burdened population.
The United States of America, the United Kingdom and a host of other countries have condemned the abduction and killing of protesters in Kenya during the ongoing anti-Finance Bill protests that have been witnessed across the country.
In a joint statement, Ambassadors & High Commissioners from 13 countries expressed concern over the violence witnessed across the country and the resultant deaths.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/credit-firms-rush-to-rescue-small-businesses-amid-social-unrest-n344591,"Credit firms rush to rescue small businesses, amid social unrest
Businesses struggling to stay afloat can now access pay-as-you-grow credit schemes from selected credit companies, giving them flexibility including repayment breaks or extended loan terms.
“This has been motivated by the scenes we have witnessed this week where businesses have suffered in the hands of some protesters, and so these debt measurers which vary from case-to-case basis, will go a long way to bail out struggling businesses and households,” said Peter Macharia, the Chief Executive of Jijenge Credit
However, this is not a formal scheme but a ‘rescue package’ to both its existing and new customers and any loan extension is purely at the discretion of the lender, said Macharia.
Tuesday and Thursday protests have left several nascent businesses to navigate challenging financial crosscurrents — and a possible slump — at a moment when they are at their most fragile.
“Young businesses or commonly called SMEs are inherently vulnerable now,” said Macharia, also a banker. “They’re likely to fail, and they are especially likely to fail now and that is why as Jijenge Credit we want to step in, to help them prop up their operations during these threatening times.”
“Data on actual business formation will not become available for several weeks, perhaps months, so it is not possible yet to measure the effects of these protests and vandalism to the economy on new and existing ventures. Whether these new businesses pull through could have broad implications for the health and dynamism of the overall economy, noted Macharia whose firm specialises on logbook loans, Title Deed Loans, Trade Finance, SME/Business Loans, among others” equipped Macharia
Entrepreneurs has expressed a mix of resolve and resignation about the months ahead. Some said they had learned lessons from the previous upheaval about how to endure financial adversity that they believed had recession-proofed their business models. “
“We will recover, we have been here before,” said Moses Opallo – an entrepreneur who runs an auto garage and spares in Nairobi, whose business is yet to recover from the aftermath of the protests.
Deadly Kenyan protests that scuppered tax hikes are violent reminders of the dangers posed by faltering economies and punishing austerity measures.
President William Ruto, who reversed support for a tax-hike measure, now must find another path to make the country’s debt pile of some $80 billion more manageable.
Senior IMF official was quoted this week saying the lender will not back down on the conditions it has imposed on Kenya.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) a World Bank–backed lender and the Kenyan authorities reached a staff-level agreement on a set of comprehensive policies and reforms needed to complete the seventh reviews of Kenya’s Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangements and the second review under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) arrangement.
Key policy actions entail corrective measures to safeguard debt sustainability, including measures underpinning the FY2024/25 budget to reverse the impact from the fiscal slippage in FY2023/24.
The medium-term outlook remains favourable predicated on advancing reforms to boost exports and fiscal revenues, rebuild buffers, and strengthen the economy’s ability to withstand external shocks.
Kenya, like others, borrowed heavily in the mid-2000s, when interest rates were low and China was splashing cash via its Belt and Road initiative to lend to emerging markets worldwide.
News outlets reported this week that, over the past 20 years Kenya amassed some $82 billion of debt to build roads, railways and factories. But not all ambitious projects were completed and many Kenyans felt they had not benefited, opening a new tab, while a slew of corruption scandals spurred allegations that elites enriched themselves.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/sakaja-blames-nms-over-ksh15b-county-pending-bills-after-senate-grilling-n345245,"Sakaja blames NMS over Ksh.15B county pending bills after Senate grilling
Appearing before the committee, Governor Sakaja emphasized that the executive office of the national government is best positioned to provide an update on the status of the said bills.
The governor at the same time blamed members of the National Assembly and senators for meddling in the county affairs, pointing an accusing finger at a legislator whom he says has been pushing for the payment of specific companies for services rendered
Sakaja who was responding to concerns raised by senators on the stock of pending bills amounting to Ksh.15 billion which was carried forward from the defunct NMS, distanced the current county government from any liabilities, stating that the tenders and subsequent pending bills were passed on to the national government through controller of statehouse who served as the accounting officers for NMS at the time.
“Why didn't you make an effort to come up with that answer that is my first supplementary, second is what is the status on the ground of these projects to which these pending bills were due,” asked Kakamega Senator Bonny Khalwale.
Migori Senator Eddy Oketch added: “Is there a clear document between the county of Nairobi in the termination that stipulates clearly the agreement of anything that is pending so that we can use that as justification to invite the office of the president to respond.”
In his response, Sakaja said, “NMS died though people tried to revive it, it is dead. The perpetual continuity that Senator Khalwale is asking about NMS was a national government function… the national government still exists so the perceptual continuity is with the national government, the accounting officer of NMS was the statehouse controller; there is still a statehouse controller so the responsibility for those liabilities rests with that office which still exists.”
The governor was hard-pressed to explain why the county continues to contend with the perennial garbage problem.
In his defence, Sakaja blamed the mess on elected officials whose companies are beneficiaries of the garbage collection business in the county.
“You’re not getting the support from the government because there are too many vested interests in how garbage is collected in Nairobi and I think it's time we started talking about these things,” Kisii Senator Richard Onyonka noted.
His nominated counterpart Tabitha Mutinda added, “Suppliers and contractors are not being paid the county is still in the same mess apart from pending bills we still have waste within the city.”
Sakaja responded by saying, “Senator and MP push for businesses to be paid, lawyers to be paid contractors to be paid, I will not mention names because that’s not why I’m here but there always is that pressure. This week I have been telling people because they are panicking it is the close of the financial year that the Ksh.4.2 billion were spending imejaa.”
“If the governor has made an allegation about a member of your committee for being conflicted you must rule on that ..we will not allow you to get away with that chairman.”
The committee directed the governor to provide more documentation on the NMS transactions and to clarify whether those companies should be paid. The governor is set to appear before the Ali Roba committee in two weeks time.

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/nzoia-sugar-blame-financial-woes-coaches-turnover-for-kpl-relegation-n345435,"Nzoia Sugar blame financial woes, coaches turnover for KPL relegation
Nzoia Sugar FC Chairman Yepets Mokua has cited the severe lack
of funds as the main reason behind their relegation from the FKF Premier League
last season.
In a candid interview with Citizen Digital, Mokua said the
financial constraint led to the departure of dependable players which in turn
affected their matches.
“The financial drought was so severe that it led to an exodus of
players, as the Nzoia Sugar Company, the club's primary sponsor, failed to meet
salary obligations. The unpaid salaries caused a significant drain on the
club's talent pool, leaving them vulnerable and unable to maintain a
competitive edge in the league,” stated Mokua.
Nzoia's instability was compounded by a revolving door of
coaches, and Mokua explained why many tacticians were hired and fired at Sudi
Stadium.
“Last season, we fired many coaches in pursuit of good results. The
frequent changes in the coaching staff disrupted team cohesion and consistency,
further hampering the club's performance,” Mokua revealed.
Despite these challenges, Mokua expressed a vote of confidence
in their current coach, Mike Muiruri, stating that the club will continue with
his services in the National Super League next season.
Meanwhile, Mokua remains hopeful about Nzoia Sugar's future, announcing
that efforts are underway to secure funding to help the club re-build.
“We are in the process of seeking funds to help us sign new
players for the upcoming season,” he said.
This proactive approach
aims to bolster the squad and prepare them for a strong campaign in the NSL.

Families are now accusing police officers of keeping their kin incommunicado after several cases of abductions were captured on CCTV footage around Nairobi during the demonstrations.
A now viral CCTV footage captured on Tuesday at around 9:55 am shows Daniel Kabusho Kaniu walking out of a restaurant along Kenyatta Road in Juja Kiambu County, in the company of an unknown individual.
In a matter of seconds, there seems to be an argument between the two, meanwhile, a parked Double Cabin car, silver in colour with registration number KDN 176Z starts moving towards the duo.
In CCTV footage retrieved from the restaurant, Daniel is seen struggling as two unknown men try to push him inside the waiting car.
When Daniel almost overpowers the two, another man is seen alighting from a white Double Cabin vehicle registration number KCZ 724A behind to help the two in abducting him. Before exiting the place after a full minute of struggle.
His family remains unaware of his whereabouts despite efforts to find him.
“Sisi kama familia hatuna clue yeyote juu yeye ni mwanabiashara wa kawaida kwanza tunashangaa mbona wanakaa na yeye karibu wiki mzima hawacommunicate hata bibi yake hawampigii simu hakuna mtu anamweleza anything tumetatafuta police stations hatumpati nashangaa sana nini inaendelea,” said Daniel’s Brother John Ranji.
The family of the 38-year-old father of three cannot understand the motive for the kidnapping. They say he is a businessman who sells clothes in Eastleigh alongside his wife and is not big on social media.
“Anybody wenye walikuwa hapo wangefaa hata wamuulize mbona wanamshika kwa nguvu mwanzo it is a democratic country na hakuna mtu ako juu ya sheria si ni kweli lakini sisi tunashangaa sana wakenya wananyamaza na mtu ameenda hadharani mchana gari zinamchukua hata si usiku,” added Ranji.
Daniel is one of several Kenyans abducted in the last few days, a move that has been condemned by the Law Society of Kenya and civil society groups.
Activist Gabriel Oguda who was abducted early Tuesday was on Wednesday released from Kajiado Police Station.
“It has been a chase, the normal chase of being taken from one police station to another without being disclosed and for this we want to notify the public that it is your right to be availed to counsel and to be told where you are being arrested,” Oguda's Lawyer Brenda Ongallo stated.
“It is unreasonable to arrest someone from Embakasi Nairobi and have his advocate trace him to Kajiado police station, it is unreasonable to keep capturing our brothers our sisters our mothers and releasing them in very strange circumstances,” James Ongamo, another lawyer noted.
LSK President Faith Odhiambo on her part stated, ""The Interior CS, a senior advocate and professor of law last Wednesday, Jun 24, 2024, tried to curtail the rights of citizens to demonstrate and has remained silent on the abduction and torture of Kenyans held for days in incommunicado in the hands of the law enforcers we will hold you equally accountable.”
Several protestors were arrested in different parts of the country and some have since been released while others are expected to appear in court.
LSK is urging the Inspector General of Police Japheth Koome to release all those who are still being held in different parts of the country.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/us-politician-criticises-harsh-imf-policies-on-kenya-n344769,"US politician criticises harsh IMF policies on Kenya
In a statement, Omar explained that the measures often affect the most vulnerable in society and result in dissatisfaction among its citizens.
She noted that such measures must be immediately addressed to resolve the country's economy.
""It's also crucial to recognize that the International Monetary Fund's austerity conditions have contributed to the economic hardships facing Kenyan citizens. These measures often disproportionately affect the most vulnerable populations and can exacerbate social unrest,"" the statement read in part.
Omar also alluded to brute force used by police officers on the protestors and questioned why law enforcement officers would use live bullets and excessive force.
""I am deeply concerned about the escalating violence in Kenya in response to nationwide protests. Reports of police using live ammunition, employing excessive force, targeting journalists, and forcibly disappearing protesters are deeply troubling and must be immediately addressed,"" Omar explained.
""The right to peacefully protest is enshrined in Kenya's constitution and must be respected by authorities. The use of deadly force against civilians exercising their democratic rights not only violates basic human rights but also undermines Kenya's democratic foundations.""
Omar expressed her solidarity with Kenyans on matters of fighting against the IMF-imposed austerity measures and police brutality.
""It is imperative that protesters remain peaceful as they continue to demand change. I stand in solidarity with the people in the wake of both state violence and IMF-imposed austerity measures. The Kenyan government must immediately disclose the location and condition of all those who have been taken into custody or disappeared, cease the use of excessive force, respect the right to peacefully protest, and continue to engage in meaningful dialogue to address the legitimate concerns of its citizens,"" she added.
After she was sworn into office in 2019, Omar became the first African refugee to become a Member of Congress. She is an experienced policy analyst, public speaker and advocate.
Since taking office in 2022, Ruto turned to IMF loans to assist in salvaging the country's economy and tackle the debt crisis. The latest loan was issued in January 2024 after Kenya received Ksh.110 billion loan to ease Eurobond repayment before maturity in June 2024.
To receive the loans, Ruto's government is compelled by the IMF to adopt tougher austerity measures in a bid to revive the economy. This has seen Ruto's administration scrap the subsidies on fuel, maize flour and also double the VAT on fuel from 8 per cent to 16 per cent.
The public has also criticised the government for its extravagant nature and at the same time urging Kenyans to tighten their belts in the wake of the current economy.
Following the anti-Finance Bill protests that have occurred in the past week, IMF Communications Director Julie Kozack reaffirmed their stance on supporting Kenya to overcome its economic hardships.
""Our main goal in supporting Kenya is to help it overcome the difficult economic challenges it faces & improve its economic prospects & well being of its people,"" she said.

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/morans-up-preparations-ahead-of-africa-7s-championships-in-mauritius-n344711,"Morans up preparations ahead of Africa 7s Championships in Mauritius
Kenya rugby sevens second-string side, Kenya
Morans, are hard at training as they prepare for the upcoming Africa 7s
Championships in Mauritius this weekend.
Morans have been in joint training with the senior
team, Shujaa, who are heading to the Paris Olympic Games, and Shujaa’s
assistant coach Louis Kisia who will take charge of the Morans in Mauritius,
says this has hugely benefited the team.
“We’ve done our phases and I think if you try
and relate these sessions that we’ve had now compared to what we were doing
before we went to the other African games, there is a very big difference. For
starters, at the All-African Games we only had eight players in camp because
half of the contingent was with Shujaa in Montevideo, Uruguay for the second
challenger series. But this time we have been in camp for the last three weeks
thanks to NOCK and the Kenya Rugby Union who have facilitated that,” opined
Kisia.
“I think we have done very good phases as I
said because we had good numbers; we had around 24 boys in camp including
Shujaa, then we had all the technical members including the head coach (Kevin
Wambua), so it’s a collective effort from all fronts to ensure Morans are well
prepared for the task ahead,” he added.
Kisia shed more light on the new format set to
be debuted in the tournament, with teams competing between June 29-30, and July
6-7, 2024.
“We will be holed up in Mauritius for the next
two weeks; it’s a format that only Rugby Africa knows why they did that. So,
first we play this weekend then we take a break during the week and do our
sessions, then do the second challenge on the first weekend of July. From the
information that I’ve gotten so far, the second tournament will be totally
different from the first one, so if you’re crowned champion in the first one,
they will do new pools and then we start all over again in the second
tournament,” he noted.
Kisia will lead the Morans in Mauritius as the
head coach, with Morgan Ngumbi as the team manager and John Eli as the
physiotherapist.
Shujaa and the rest of the technical bench
will remain in Nairobi for further training, before heading out to Miramas,
France, next month for final touches before the Olympic Games kick off.
Kenya are in Pool A
alongside hosts Mauritius, Nigeria and Madagascar.

In a press briefing at his Mombasa residence on Wednesday, Gachagua acknowledged the government's failure to listen to the public sentiments of those who demanded that the entire Finance Bill be rejected.
He attributed the matter to a dysfunctional National Intelligence Service led by Director General Noordin Haji.
In what was dubbed as 'One Million March' Kenyan youth had scheduled to march to State House to protest against the killing witnessed during the protests and seek to remove President William from office.
""As Deputy president and patriotic son, I want to appeal to Gen Z to call off the protests for tomorrow because their cry has been heard by the president. He has accepted that there was a disconnect and it is only fair we call off the protests so that we don't have further loss of lives and destruction of property,"" Gachagua said.
""It is an appeal I have made as a father and a parent. To our young generation, we love you and respect you. Please my sons and daughters, I plead with you to save lives, make an announcement this evening and call off the protests.""
The deputy president noted that the president would have heeded Kenyans' cries had he received the proper intelligence from the NIS.
""Had the NIS briefed the president two months ago about how the people feel about the Finance Bill, so many Kenyans would not have died,"" Gachagua said.
""They slept on the job, it had to take people to die, protests across the country for the president to know the truth.""
The DP blamed NIS director Noordin Haji for the chaos that erupted across the country and demanded that he be held accountable for the bloodshed witnessed during the protests.
He reiterated his call for Haji's resignation and urged Ruto to recall three previously fired directors in order to restore dignity to the office.
""Senior officers have told me that they did not have advanced intelligence about the intensity of the protests. Because of inferiority complex, he (Noordin Haji) chased away all the people senior to him therefore crippling that service,"" he remarked.
""Haji must take responsibility for the deaths that occurred, for the mayhem, for failing Ruto and failing the country. He must do the honourable thing and resign from his position.""

https://www.citizen.digital/news/us-judge-sentences-honduran-ex-president-to-45-years-for-drug-trafficking-n344816,"US judge sentences Honduran ex-president to 45 years for drug trafficking
Former Honduran President Juan
Orlando Hernandez was sentenced Wednesday in New York to 45 years in U.S.
prison for aiding drug traffickers who used the Honduran military and national
police forces to transport large amounts of cocaine into the United States.
Hernandez, 55, governed Honduras, a U.S. ally in Central America, from 2014 to 2022, serving two terms.
He was arrested at his home in
the capital, Tegucigalpa, three months after leaving office in 2022 and was
extradited to the U.S. in April of that year.
His brother, Juan Antonio ""Tony"" Hernandez, was sentenced
to life in prison in 2021 on similar drug-related charges.
Prosecutors alleged that Hernandez had colluded with drug
traffickers since 2004, accepting millions of dollars in bribes. They argued
for a life sentence, saying it would deter other traffickers and corrupt
officials.
""Hernandez did more to combat drug trafficking in
Honduras than any president before or since,"" said his lawyer, Renato
Stabile, who sought a maximum sentence of 40 years and indicated Hernandez
would appeal.
During the trial in Manhattan federal court, Hernandez
admitted drug money had permeated all major political parties in Honduras but
denied personally accepting bribes. The jury convicted him in March based on
evidence that he used drug money to manipulate elections in 2013 and 2017.
Hernandez maintained his innocence, attributing the charges
to revenge by convicted traffickers opposed to his anti-drug policies.
Judge P. Kevin Castel also fined him $8 million. Castel
called the former president a ""two-faced politician hungry for power""
and said he protected certain traffickers.
Hernandez criticized the trial's fairness and claimed
critical evidence was excluded.
""It's as if I had been thrown into a deep river with my hands bound,"" Hernandez said through an interpreter.

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/we-have-already-won-the-euros-says-georgia-coach-sagnol-n344916,"'We have already won the Euros', says Georgia coach Sagnol
Georgia coach Willy Sagnol insisted the rank outsiders would
go into Sunday's Euro 2024 clash with Spain in relaxed mood having already far
exceeded expectations by making it to the last 16.
""We will go into this game with a lot of confidence because we have absolutely nothing to lose. For me we have already won the European Championship and I am just excited to be on the pitch,"" Sagnol told reporters in Cologne, where Sunday's game will be played.
Georgia are appearing at a major tournament for the first time and made it to the knockout phase with a remarkable 2-0 win over Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal in their last group match on Wednesday.
That followed a 3-1 loss to Turkey and a 1-1 draw with the Czech Republic and allowed them to progress from Group F as one of the best third-placed finishers.
However, all the evidence suggests their run will come to an end against a Spain side who have been the most impressive team so far at the tournament, winning all three group games without letting in a goal.
Georgia have played Spain four times since Frenchman Sagnol was appointed coach in early 2021, and have lost all four meetings.
They went down twice in the 2022 World Cup qualifiers, and then lost twice more in qualifying for this competition.
That included a chastening 7-1 reverse at home in Tbilisi last September.
""It was a difficult moment for us but sometimes to get further in life you need moments like that, where it is very difficult, where you are not good, where you think you have done everything bad,"" Sagnol reflected.
""Without difficulties you can't have great achievements. It was part of our journey.
""If we are here today I am sure this 7-1 taught us a lot of things and we learnt a lot of things from it.""
The 47-year-old former France international added: ""Spain are clearly the best team in the competition up until now so that is why it is going to be a tough match.
""We played four times against them, we lost four times, but now it is a different competition, a different atmosphere, a different environment, so many things can happen.""

On Tuesday last week, during the first of
that week's anti-Finance Bill protests in Nairobi, videos of Frank Okoth, a
young Gen Z protestor, circulated widely on social media.
They showed him either gasping for air, his
body riddled with bullets or being taken into an ambulance, seemingly lifeless,
hours after being shot by police during the protests at Parliament.
Those images fuelled speculations over his
state of health, with some going as far as declaring him dead.
Many were doubtful that he had survived the
six bullets pumped into his body, but Frank, like the proverbial cat with nine
lives, has lived to tell his story.

The 2024 Nairobi City Marathon that was scheduled for this
Sunday, July 7, has been postponed to September 8.
According to the organizing committee, the postponement has
been occasioned by unavoidable external circumstances beyond their control.
Thousands of athletes who had already registered for the
event had further proposed that it be shelved to another date.
However, the committee “would also like to appreciate those
who genuinely wanted the event to still take place.”
“We apologize to anyone who had expended resources and time
preparing for this marathon and empathize with the inconvenience brought upon
you by the sudden change of plans.
“We will push full steam ahead and work non-stop to ensure
that the marathon is one of the biggest, most memorable events across the globe
this year.” Read the statement.
“This postponement provides us with the opportunity to put
in place measures to ensure a bigger and better edition than the previous two.”
It added.
The committee further directed interested participants to use
this extended period to continue registering for the marathon and training for
it.
“We thank all those who have thus far registered, many of whom
include foreign athletes.
“We believe that the entry of these foreign athletes will go
a long way in spicing up the competition and enhancing Nairobi City Marathon's
status as one of the world's most-watched road races.
“A big thank you to all stakeholders who have contributed in
one way or another toward the success of the previous editions as well as the
upcoming ones.
“Let us continue with the same fervor for the sport and work
together towards a glorious event as the countdown to September 8 officially
begins now.”

Published on: July 07, 2024 06:30 (EAT)

Israel launched deadly strikes Sunday on the Gaza Strip as its war against Hamas entered its 10th month, with diplomatic efforts underway to secure a ceasefire and hostage release deal.
Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, an ally of Palestinian militant group Hamas, fired rocket salvoes at northern Israel, in the latest cross-border clashes that have sparked fears of a full-scale war.
In Israel, anti-government protesters demanding a hostage release deal blocked roads in the commercial hub of Tel Aviv as they marked a nationwide ""disruption day"" from 6:29 am, the time Hamas launched their attack on October 7.
Efforts towards a truce continued with US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators hoping to halt the Gaza war, which has caused mass civilian casualties and devastated swathes of the coastal territory.
Egypt's state-linked Al-Qahera News said Cairo was ""hosting Israeli and American delegations to discuss the outstanding points"", citing an unnamed high-level official source.
Mediators were in contact with Hamas amid ""intensive Egyptian meetings this week with all parties"", said the news report late Saturday, without elaborating.
Israel has said it would send a delegation to continue talks with Qatari mediators, though a government spokesman said Friday there were still ""gaps"" with Hamas.
US President Joe Biden announced a plan in late May that included an initial six-week truce and the exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.
Talks quickly stalled but a US official said Thursday that a new proposal from Hamas ""moves the process forward and may provide the basis for closing the deal"".
Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan told AFP that US mediators ""welcomed"" the group's latest proposals ""and passed them on to the Israeli side"".
""Now the ball is in the Israeli court,"" said Hamdan.
At a rally in Tel Aviv, Israeli data scientist Yoni Peleg, 34, said protesters were crying ""out for help... to end the war"" and pressure Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to secure the release of the remaining hostages.
The fighting and bombardment in besieged Gaza raged on unabated, with medics and emergency services in the Hamas-run territory reporting yet more deaths in several strikes on Sunday.
The Palestinian Red Crescent said two children were among six dead when a central Gaza house was hit, and paramedics reported nine fatalities in two strikes on Gaza City.
An AFP correspondent said Israeli drones were firing in Gaza City's Shujaiya district, which has been largely evacuated and rocked by intense battles for nearly two weeks.
The Israeli military said that in Shujaiya, its troops killed ""several"" militants and ""dismantled terror infrastructure sites"".
Israeli forces killed 30 Palestinian militants in far-southern Rafah over the past day, the military added, also reporting clashes in nearby Khan Yunis.
Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on southern Israel that set off the war resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.
The militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza, including 42 the military says are dead.
Vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel has carried out a military offensive that has killed at least 38,153 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to data from the territory's health ministry.
The health ministry toll includes 16 people killed Saturday in a strike on a UN-run school in the central Nuseirat refugee camp that was sheltering displaced Palestinians, which the Israeli military said had been used by militants.
The war has uprooted nearly all Gazans, left almost 500,000 people enduring ""catastrophic"" hunger and shuttered most hospitals, UN agencies say.
Dr Muhammad Salha, acting director of Al-Awda Hospital in Jabalia, said severe shortages amid Israel's siege of Gaza left the facility with ""no fuel"".
""The situation is very difficult,"" he said. ""We have postponed many scheduled operations due to the lack of fuel.""
Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah have exchanged almost daily cross-border fire since the Gaza war began.
The attacks and rhetoric have escalated in recent weeks, sparking fears of a wider conflagration.
While the exchanges have been largely restricted to the border areas, Israel has repeatedly struck deep inside eastern Lebanon, including on Saturday in an attack that killed a Hezbollah operative.
Early on Sunday, air raid sirens sounded across northern Israel and the military reported that 20 rockets were fired, with some intercepted.
Hezbollah said it had targeted an Israeli army base west of Tiberias ""in response to the... assassination"" carried out the day before.
Israeli police said one person was wounded by shrapnel in Kfar Zeitim near Tiberias, around 30 kilometres (over 18 miles) from the Lebanese border.
Hezbollah later claimed a second barrage of rockets targeting a military base elsewhere in northern Israel.

Kapseret Member of Parliament Oscar Sudi
has announced that he will be taking a hiatus from public fundraising events,
commonly known as harambees.
Taking to X on Sunday evening, the legislator stated that he was ""going on leave for one year or two"" and that he would not appear in public for political engagements, until when ""God speaks to him"".
""Going forward, I'll not participate
in any Harambee because it has been used to malign and disparage the good
course, let it be banned. Thus the current happenings in the country call for
introspection and consequently, I'm taking a sabbatical leave from public
engagements,"" he said.
Sudi spoke minutes after President William
Ruto hosted a roundtable with a section of Kenyan media, where he admitted that the 'harambee
culture' among politicians should be nipped in the bud.
""On matters of politics on the pulpit
I am one hundred per cent aligned. We shouldn't be using pulpits in churches to
prosecute politics,"" said Ruto during the Sunday evening interview in
State House.
""We need to change the culture of
harambee. It started as a noble exercise it supported many people to go to
school but I think it has stretched too far. We must stop harambees because it
is breeding corruption.""
This lies on the backdrop of public uproar
over the millions of shillings politicians pour into these fundraising
functions, whose source has been questioned severally and sometimes linked to
corruption.
Sudi has dismissed claims he donated Ksh.20
million at a previous church fundraiser, saying in a video shared on Sunday that
the sum was the total event contribution and not the amount he donated.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/black-tuesday-how-international-media-covered-kenyas-anti-finance-bill-protests-n344695,"Black Tuesday: How international media covered Kenya's anti-Finance Bill protests
The day-long nationwide protests turned chaotic after police officers started using teargas and live ammunition to repel the defiant crowd which saw some of the protesters breaching a section of parliament building.
The breach was a few minutes after the lawmakers voted 195 to 106 in favour of the tax bill which protesters argue will exacerbate the cost of living with the proposed punitive taxes in places.
Parliament's ceremonial mace, which symbolizes the authority of the legislature, was stolen and some parts of the building were vandalized and set on fire.
Outside parliament, two lifeless bodies could be seen after they were caught by stray bullets in the melee.
Parts of City Hall were also torched as protesters walked out with furniture and marched with them in the streets.
Amnesty International and other human rights watch groups say that at least five people were shot dead and 31 were injured but the numbers, however not confirmed, have risen based on the accounts of paramedics and social media posts.
While the uproar of Kenyans filled the streets the globe was also keeping an eye, following the events as they ensued minute by minute.
International media outlets among them CNN, New York Times, Reuters, The Guardian and others alike were also on the ground capturing the unravelling scenes.
The most profound themes the outlets seemed to keep a keen eye on were police brutality and the response from government authorities including President William Ruto.
Also, there was a stark depiction of the culmination of 'Black Tuesday' as the abduction of prominent supporters of the protests went mysteriously missing.
""Young Kenyans who have helped to fuel the protests said that their movement transcends class, tribe and race,"" reads an excerpt from a publication by NYT.
""A paramedic said at least 10 people had died and a Reuters journalist outside the parliament counted the bodies of at least five protesters,"" said the Guardian.
Activists urged protesters to leave the city center at around 6:00 pm with an alarming alert “Go home. While it’s still safe. The government will send goons to destroy, loot and blame peaceful protesters. They must listen to us. Spread the word for people to start walking home in groups. We shall be back.” wrote Boniface Mwangi on his X account.
Public transportation services were not readily available and many were forced to walk home with others.
In a joint statement, the ambassadors of 13 Western embassies in Kenya, including the United States, said they were “shocked” by the scenes outside the Kenyan Parliament and “deeply concerned” by allegations that security forces had abducted some protesters.
Defence Cabinet Secretary Aden Duale also noted that the military has been deployed to support the country’s police services.
Later in the evening President William Ruto condemned the violence witnessed during the day as he described the breach of parliament as treasonous, vowing to crack down on the 'organisers and financiers of the protests.
According to Ruto, it is inconceivable that ""criminals posing as peaceful protesters"" can terrorise people, elected representatives, and institutions and expect to get away with it.
""We must isolate crime from democratic expression and separate criminals from people exercising their freedom of expression and divergent opinion,"" he added.
His sentiments seemed to have further agitated Kenyans as many went online to mock his ""insensitive"" remarks.
The protesters have vowed to breach State House tomorrow, Thursday, June 26.

US President Joe Biden and his Republican challenger Donald Trump launched into their first debate of the 2024 election cycle Thursday at CNN's headquarters in Atlanta.
The two rivals did not shake hands as they took their positions at podiums just feet apart in a studio with no live audience. They will seek to reshape the political narrative as they battle over economic issues, foreign policy and international crises, immigration, and the state of American democracy.
Biden, who took the opening question, quickly assailed his predecessor for presiding over ""an economy that was in free fall"" and a pandemic that ""was so badly handled, many people were dying.""
Trump quickly shot back that under his 2017-2021 leadership, ""we had the greatest economy in the history of our country,"" and that inflation under Biden today is ""killing"" the United States.
The current and former presidents are squaring off at a pivotal moment, with many voters expressing apprehension over the choice between Biden, at 81 the oldest ever incumbent, and 71-year-old Trump, now a convicted felon.
Both candidates will seek to counter those dynamics as they try to win over undecided voters.
Millions of Americans are tuning in to a debate that fires the starting gun on what promises to be a bruising summer of campaigning, in a deeply polarized and tense United States still scarred by the chaos and violence that accompanied the 2020 election.

The first half of the showdown ended in a goalless draw with both teams rueing missed chances.

Naivas midfielder Brian Ouru was also substituted in the 70th minute after sustaining an injury.

Sofapaka assistant coach Ezekiel Akwana believes his team is going to stay in the top-tier next season as things are already going according to their plan.
""The plan was to get a draw in this match but I got a win. The next match I don't need to win, I just need to get a draw,"" said Akwana.
Naivas head coach Collins Omondi noted that his team wasted a lot of chances but asserted they were going to work on it.
""We created plenty of chances but failed to score. We are going to work on our mistakes and improve because our main problem today was scoring goals,"" Omondi said.
The stage is set for a thrilling return leg on July 14 at Dandora Stadium, where Naivas will seek redemption and Sofapaka will aim to secure their top-tier status for the next season.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/uda-claims-rejected-politicians-ngos-sponsoring-violence-during-gen-z-protests-n345156,"UDA claims 'rejected politicians,' NGOs sponsoring violence during Gen Z protests
The ruling United Democratic Alliance (UDA)
party now claims a section of politicians and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)
have infiltrated the ongoing youth-led anti-government protests with their own
selfish agendas.
UDA Secretary General Cleophas Malala, in a statement to newsrooms on Wednesday, said that despite the protests being largely non-aligned in the initial stages, political interests have now crept in and taken over, leading to chaos and anarchy.
He hence urged the country’s investigative
agencies to round up and bring to book individuals he said have
been sponsoring violence and looting of businesses across the country under the
guise of participating in the demonstrations.
“We note with sadness that certain egocentric
individuals within the political class and some NGOs have infiltrated the
demonstrations, hijacking it for their selfish goals. The tone of the Gen Z
demonstrations was clearly nonpolitical and non-ethnicized. It is a shame that
certain rejected political figures are hoping to reap political capital from
this state of affairs,” he stated.
“We call upon the Directorate of Criminal
Investigations (DCI) and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecution
(ODPP) to expedite their investigations into the violent incidents that marred
the demonstrations. We specifically urge these agencies to identify and
prosecute the financiers, sponsors, and perpetrators responsible for funding
the goons who infiltrated the peaceful protests, resulting in violence and
looting.”
While condoling with families that have lost
their loved ones during the protests, Malala went ahead to call for action
against rogue police officers found to have employed unnecessary excesses in
carrying out their mandates, thereby engaging in professional misconduct and
negligence.
He, in the same vein, commended police
officers who have upheld the law and exercised restraint in the face of
provocation by some of the rogue protesters.
“We urge the police to intensify their
efforts in protecting the lives and property of all citizens during such
events. It is imperative that law enforcement agencies ensure the safety and
security of everyone, maintaining peace and order in our communities,” said the
UDA Secretary General.
“We thank the Gen Z demonstrators for their
efforts to remain peaceful and urge them to be extra vigilant against
individuals who seek to distort their cause with wanton looting and destruction
of property. Your commitment to non-violence is crucial, and we assure you that
the Government is listening to your voices and concerns.”

https://www.citizen.digital/news/us-govt-calls-president-ruto-over-kenyan-police-violence-n344760,"US gov't calls President Ruto over Kenyan police violence
United States Secretary of State Antony
Blinken has emphasized that Kenyan police need to exercise restraint and
refrain from using violence on demonstrators protesting the Finance Bill 2024.
The spokesperson for the U.S. Department of
State, Mathew Miller on Wednesday said Blinken had a phone call with President
William Ruto, in which he noted a need to reduce tension in the country.
“In a call with Kenyan President Ruto, Secretary
Blinken emphasized the importance of reducing tensions and ensuring security
services demonstrate restraint and refrain from violence,” Miller said in an X
post at 12:55 a.m. Thursday East African Time (Wednesday 2:55 p.m. Pacific Time).
“The U.S. will remain a steadfast partner of Kenya’s government and people as they address economic challenges.”
In a call with Kenyan President Ruto, @SecBlinken emphasized the importance of reducing tensions and ensuring security services demonstrate restraint and refrain from violence. The U.S. will remain a steadfast partner of Kenya’s government and people as they address economic…
While it is not clear when Ruto spoke to Blinken,
the president some minutes to 5 p.m. on Wednesday announced he would not sign
the contentious Bill after mounting public pressure.
In a televised address, Ruto said he chose
not to assent to the proposed law but referred it back to Parliament with his
reservations, proposing the deletion of all clauses.
The Bill proposed increased taxation as
Ruto’s government sought to raise an additional Ksh.346.7 billion in revenue
for the 2024/25 budget.
Peaceful youth-led demonstrations against it
have however turned deadly as police fire live bullets and tear gas canisters at
protesters.
The death toll on Wednesday stood at 22, according
to the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights, which said over 300 others
were injured and 50 more arrested.
Following Ruto’s announcement that he would not assent to the 2024 Finance Bill, a section of demonstrators on social media
said they were still prepared to resume protests Thursday in solidarity with
those police killed.

https://www.citizen.digital/lifestyle/profile-how-dennis-njenga-built-kaka-empire-and-what-it-takes-to-make-a-king-n345235,"PROFILE: How Dennis Njenga built Kaka Empire, and what it takes to make a King
Dennis
Njenga has seen so much death in his lifetime that he says it doesn’t even faze
him anymore. He watched all his childhood friends get gunned down by police for
engaging in crime, he lost both his parents within a span of two years when he
was still a teenager, and his only brother passed away a few years ago in
Tanzania.
These
deaths broke him, and yet, each time, he picked the pieces right back up,
dusted off his shoulders and kept moving, never once letting the pain or
numbness of it all halt his spirit.
And
so, over the years, he has done everything from odd market jobs to white collar
office jobs to make ends meet and take care of his family, just like his father
taught him at his death bed.
Mr.
Njenga - known to his friends and family as just 'Kamlesh' - was once a prolific footballer, and even secured a slot to go play
abroad, but his father advised him against it because that meant abandoning his
studies, which was something that he was simply just not going to allow.
So,
after his father passed on, he was forced to drop out of school for lack of
fees and began carrying for people sacks of waru at Kimende market for meagre pay; he also cleaned bars and video shops and did all manner of blue-collar
work before eventually managing to go back to school. From there, he never
looked back.
Mr.
Njenga previously worked in both the banking and insurance sectors, picking up a
million accomplishments along the way like;
Golden Customer Product Adviser NIC Bank, Youngest Team Leader Personal Banking
NIC Bank, Youngest Team Leader Retail Banking NIC Bank, Unit Manager at Pan
Africa Life Assurance Company, and Branch Manager at Pan Africa Life Assurance
Company.
He is now the Co-Founder, Head of Talent, and Managing
Partner at Kaka Empire, a record label he envisioned, established and runs with his high school
desk-mate and longtime best friend, rap maestro King Kaka.
Besides King Kaka, he manages an impressive roster of artists
under the label including Femi One and Jadi, and has been instrumental in the
careers of other past signees like Avril, Timmy T-Dat, Arrow Bwoy, comedian
Owago Onyiro, and Tanzanian singer Rich Mavoko.
For his work in the industry, he has scooped up a few awards
along the way such as; Top 40 under 40
Founders Africa 2024, Top 40 under 40 Kenya Men 2023, Top 100 Executive Awards
2023, People’s Choice Award 2023, and Music Business Executive among others.
Mr. Njenga met Citizen
Digital’s IAN OMONDI for breakfast and told him he is finally at peace with
life, no matter what comes his way.
Why do
people call you ‘Kamlesh’?
When
I was in Class 8, there was a lot of beef between Calif Records and Scratch
Records. My neighbours Ray and Tall used to record their music at Scratch, so
one day I went with them just to experience what happens at the studio, and ended
up doing a small rap.
Kamlesh
Pattni was in the news a lot at the time because of the Goldenberg scandal. So,
because my middle name is Kamau, guys at the studio just started calling me
‘Kamlesh’ and I stuck with it as my rap name.
What happened
to your rap career?
I
joined Eastleigh High School where I met King Kaka, who was my desk-mate, and we
started doing a few rap battles here and there.
One
day we went to Madaraka to record at rapper Calvo Mistari’s studio and they
told us to spit a few bars for them first so that they could decide whether or
not we were worth their time.
King
Kaka went first and did his poetry thing and they were impressed. Then I did my
rap and Calvo said “Hii kitu huwezani nayo bro.” That was the end.
So Calvo
Mistari is to blame for the death of your rap dream?
You
can say that! [Laughs]
When you
think about your childhood, what dominates your mind?
The
environment we were in, I think. All my peers died by the time they were 16,
because they all ended up in crime.
We
lived in Pumwani in a two-room house; one served as the bedroom and sitting
room, the other was the kitchen. It was a bit strenuous because we were five
siblings in that house, alongside our parents and the househelp.
But
what I’m proud of about my childhood is that I used to play a lot of soccer, it
was the uniting factor that took us away from crime.
I
played for the Mathare Youth Sports Association (MAYSA) and got an opportunity
to go play in Norway but because I was in Class 8, and my father was education-oriented,
I couldn’t go.
You lost
your parents at a very young age, how do you remember that period being like?
I
didn’t even realize what was happening then. My mum passed away when I was 13,
and then my dad followed two years later.
My
father moved us from Pumwani back to the village in Kimende during the period
of his illness, and I was by his side till the very end; he advised me a lot
during that time - about girls, drugs, and money.
After
his death, I had to man up because no one else was going to provide for us. My
older siblings are all women and my younger brother was in school then. We lived
in my late grandmother’s house so luckily we were not paying rent, but we
didn’t have food.
I
started working at the market in Kimende, carrying around sacks of waru and
cabbage that were being dropped off by lorries in wholesale. I would also go to
newly constructed buildings and clean the rooms for small pay before people
moved in. At some point I worked in a bar, and also cleaned video shops.
I
didn’t fully understand what was happening, but I kind of just got into the
system and started becoming an adult as a child.
My father
died in 2017, but I was old enough to process grief by then. How does a 13-year-old
boy process grief?
You
don’t really process it, the brain sort of just blocks it, because later on in
life is when I realized that I never really grieved my parents properly.
When
my mum passed away, I’d just left her that morning and she was very unwell and
had even lost her memory. I remember, as I was dressing up, she kept asking me,
“Who are you and where are you going at this hour?” But I was just laughing
with her because I couldn’t understand what was going on, and when I came back
home that evening from school, I found a lot of people there and just felt a
sadness, but I couldn’t even cry.
Even
we were burying her, I didn’t go to view the body because it was like a
terrible dream I was in. So, I couldn’t really grieve, but at some point in
life it hits you.
I’ve
always been a positive person; I’ve always believed that in anything I do,
things are going to come my way, because I put in the work. I know that if I’m
consistent and keep pushing, things will work out. Even when I was carrying
those sacks of waru at the market in Kimende, I was doing it with all my hard work and
soul.
When
I started my first sales job at NIC Bank, because the department was still new
and we were just starting out, I went into it knowing and accepting that “mimi ni
fala, but I’m here to learn.”
I
had one trouser that I was wearing five days a week, and got so many
rejections, but I was very consistent with it. Until I became recognized and
started climbing the ladder, all the way to team leader.
So then you
left banking and went into the insurance sector, and later shifted to
entertainment. How did that happen?
Banking
is an 8-5 job; so you arrive at 7am and you close the books at 4pm, then you
can go home. What I used to do was that after leaving the office, I would look
for Rabbit (now King Kaka) who was always busy with a lot of things at Imenti
House in town; he was selling t-shirts, doing graphics at cyber cafés, and a
million other things.
We
would meet at, say 6pm, and walk around town looking for things to do until 9pm
when I would head back home to Kimende. During that stage is when we started
creating the masterplan for Kaka Empire.
How
I got to Pan Africa Life Assurance was that I went to sell an account to the
then General Manager Ezekiel Owuor; he was impressed by my sales skills and
just said, “Come I give you a job on this side.” Banking is rigid, while
insurance is broad. So when I saw the opportunity of growth, and with better
earnings, I crossed over.
What was the
tipping point that landed you into entertainment?
When
I was still in insurance, we used to do a lot of gigs with King Kaka; so you’d
find me in the office on weekdays and in Kisii or Kakamega for shows with him
on the weekend.
Gradually,
we started seeing income streaming in; we were making anything between
Ksh.30,000 to Ksh.100,000 in a month. So, I knew there was something there, and
that if I just kept putting in the work, that money would eventually grow.
So
we built a proper structure and brought in the first employee – King Kaka’s
personal DJ JR – and then another guy called Brian Robotix who would run around
town for us when we were promoting CDs, and then a road manager, and so on and
so forth.
Eventually,
when we made our first Ksh.200,000 in one month, I went to the office and
handed in my resignation letter.
Kenyan
record labels at that time were sort of just winging it, what did you want to
achieve with Kaka Empire?
I
wanted us to do things differently, because I saw what record labels were. Actually,
there was no record label, I can boast and say that Kaka Empire was the first
record label. What were there were studios run by producers who also acted as
booking agents for musicians.
With
my experience in corporate, I saw how things were done. For instance, Mondays
there would be status meetings to tell us what you did the previous week and
what you’re doing this new week. I knew there had to be someone called an
Accountant, a Lawyer…just a basic, proper structure on how things run.
We
have been here for the last nine years actively, although we started the
blueprint 11 years ago, and it is those structures that keep us going on even
now.
How do you
walk into a corporate boardroom and convince the suits that your guy is the right
person for the job?
It
starts with the brand that has already been set. Before you take the product to
the boardroom, how does the product look? Is the product boardroom friendly?
Does it speak the values of what that company speaks or looks for?
But
the most important thing is how you present yourself, as a manager. If you take
your brand as seriously as that person in the boardroom takes their company,
then they’ll listen to you. The way you communicate and how you dress speaks
volumes.
I
remember when we were looking for our first endorsement for King Kaka, I walked
into a meeting with an agency in a suit and tie. They looked at me and said;
“The managers we have seen here before usually come in hats and sagged jeans,
looking like artists themselves…but you’re different.”
Which of the
artists that you manage under Kaka Empire gives you the most headache? I promise
I won’t tell.
[Laughs]
Each brand has its own unique challenges, so I can’t say there’s a specific one
that gives me more headache than the other; they all have different personalities.
Hahah!
Alright. You’re doing a sort of documentary about yourself. As someone whose
entire job entails being behind the scenes, why did you feel the need to come out
in front of the camera now?
Music managers, or anyone who is behind artists and
other creative brands, the people who put in the work and burn the midnight
candle, don’t really get recognized. But over the last two years I’ve gotten a
lot of recognition; I was recognized by The People Daily as one of the industry
shakers, I was nominated for The People’s Choice Awards, I was nominated for an Executive Award in Tanzania, I was recognized by Business Daily for ‘Top 40
Under 40’ in Kenya, later I was also recognized by ‘Top Forty Under 40 Africa.’
All this for the work I’ve done in the industry.
This showed me that there’s a lot I’m not giving
out, so it’s important for me to tell my story and act as a point of reference
for people who want to venture into this type of business to know that their
efforts will matter in the end.
The
mini-documentary is titled ‘The King Maker,’ what does that mean?
It’s simple, really; I’ve made kings. I’ve made big
brands. I’ve made household names, and I’m proud of that. Apart from the brands
I work directly with, in the industry at large I have almost all the brands in
some way; either I’ve given them work or advice.
What have
you learnt about artists, in general, after all these years interacting with
them?
First of all, musicians are humans; you have to deal
with them the same way you would deal with your younger siblings or children.
What you need to have are people management skills, which I think I got from my
days in banking and insurance.
Whenever a creative feels like now they’re well-known,
things become different, and they start thinking they know better than you as
their manager. But it is the constant reminder to them that we’re a team and
we’re here to win together.
What does it
take for you, as the manager who does the donkey work, to take the back seat
and watch all the glory being given to the artist who just shows up and puts their signature?
For you to be a manager you have to be very humble,
and recognize that you cannot be bigger than your brand or talent, and that has
to be with you every day. You have to understand that your reward is not
immediate; for instance, I’ve worked for 9 years and only just started getting some
recognition.
Look at it this way; as a manager, if your artist
strikes a deal with a corporate and gets a million shillings, you’re only going
to get between 10%-20% of that amount. So you have to stay humble and not allow
yourself to start getting jealous about that disparity, because then there’s
nowhere you or the artist will go. You need to understand your role and where
you lie.
Of the multitude
of awards and recognition you’ve received over the years, which would you run into a burning building to save?
I dropped out of school at 15, and got an
opportunity to go back and repeat from Form Two when I was turning 17. My
sister gave me Ksh.6,000 and I enrolled into Kimende High School. That money
was only covering half of the term, and I didn’t have anyone else to pay for my
fees after that.
Luckily, through God, there’s a company called Carbacid
Investments that mines carbon dioxide in those sides of Kenya. They came up
with a programme to give out scholarships to the top three students in every
stream at the school, so I ensured that I was always in the top three, because
then that meant my school fees were covered for the rest of the year.
What used to happen is that each time you were in
that top three list, you were given a certificate from the company; those are
the accreditations I am most attached to, purely because of the hardship I went
through – sometimes having to go without food – to just make sure my name was always
on the list.
What season
do you think you are in life right now?
I’m at a stage of self-actualization. I’m happy and
contented with life.
What period
were you most conflicted?
When I was around 33; I lost my younger brother then.
The last call I had with him was when he was in bed sick, and then he passed
away in Tanzania, so I had to go down there alone and bring back his body. I
was also undergoing a lot of personal issues in my life then, trying to figure
out where I was and where I needed to be, so it was a really confusing stage in
my life.
I was looking at things and saying ‘I have achieved
a lot in terms of business, but why am I not happy?’ But then I read somewhere
that at the point in your life when things seem very confusing, that’s when you
go hard.
What are
some of your fears and anxieties in life now?
None. If its death, I’ve seen people very close to
me dying. I lost all of my childhood friends to crime. My dad passed away in
our house and I’m the one that cleaned his body and took it to the mortuary and
personally inserted it into those freezers then clothed it on burial day.
So, I don’t fear nothing, not even death. I’m at
peace.
In another
dimension, who would you rather be sitting here having this coffee and
conversation with?
My dad; he was a very big influence on my life, I
looked up to him a lot, and he taught me the value of family. I saw it in how
he raised us and how he used to work very hard to ensure that we had something
on the table, even on very terrible days when he had nothing left in him to
give.
The other person would be my daughter, she’s turning
eight this year and we talk abut everything. Just recently we were watching my
interview on TV as it was being aired, and when I was asked who inspires
me and I said myself, she got very angry and told me “You should have said your
daughter.”[Laughs]
How did how
you were raised influence how you’re raising your children?
That’s a good question, and it’s funny you should ask
because I’ve actually been thinking a lot about it lately. I don’t want my son
or daughter to grow up to be weak, I want them to be as strong as I am. And,
because I went through a bit of hardship, I tend to give them everything that I
did not have. The bad thing about that is that if you give kids everything they
want, they tend to get comfortable. So, it’s a very delicate balance.
What kind of
boss are you?
I’m people-driven. I value people more than even the
income that we bring in or the assets that we have as a company. For me, people
are everything, and if my people are happy, then I know the company will have
longevity.
What
inspired the rebranding from Rabbit to Kaka Sungura to now King Kaka? From a
managerial perspective.
We recognized that for any musician, your audience
changes every four years; like the normal secondary school life. Even if you
look at the normal trends of music, every four years a new genre erupts.
There was the period when HipHop was huge, then four
years elapsed and music became more commercial, after another four years came
Gengetone, and now we have Arbantone; in another four years we’ll have
something else.
So, we realized that as this cycle goes on, your
brand is also getting old, and the type of audience and the music they resonate
with is no longer the same. Because when you’re in campus you’re not listening
to the same music you were listening to in high school.
Rabbit was a street/hustler brand; Kaka Sungura was
a more polite, laid-back personality with a knack for poetry; then we grew up
and asked ourselves how to get him into the boardrooms, and that’s how he
became King Kaka.
So, he stopped wearing the beanies and polo shirts
that were his trademark look then and took up suits and ties. Because, if you
think about it, the people he was entertaining in high school, are the ones who
were now working as managers and decision makers in these boardrooms.
What makes
an artist, talent or hard work?
Hard work is number one. You can have zero talent,
but if you work so hard at it, people will notice you.
What is the one thing you think I should’ve asked you that I
didn’t?
Maybe
I could just give parting shot:
Life
has its own stages. For any career path that you choose, there are times you
will fail, and other times that you will succeed. When you fail, don’t be
discouraged; when you succeed, be very worried.

https://www.citizen.digital/lifestyle/kenyan-women-speak-on-confronting-colourism-and-embracing-natural-beauty-n345119,"Kenyan women speak on confronting colourism and embracing natural beauty
This story aims to delve deeper into the intricacies of Colourism, specifically exploring biases favouring lighter skin tones over darker ones.
According to research, Colourism is a form of discrimination where dark-skinned people of colour are perceived and treated less favourably than their lighter-skinned counterparts within the same ethnic group.
Citizen Digital interviewed several dark-skinned individuals to understand their experiences: the challenges they face, their initial encounters with Colourism, how it has affected their self-esteem, and how they have learned to overcome it.
Serena's first encounter with Colourism occurred when she was a young girl in primary school. Due to her age, she couldn't quite articulate it, but she definitely felt discriminated against.
""I was around 9 or 10 years old when I started sensing a divide among us kids—between those with darker skin and those with lighter skin, even within our small play groups,"" Serena recalled.
Adhiambo experienced Colourism at the age of 7 or 8, which deeply impacted her self-worth.
""I remember preparing to perform at a parents' day event when a teacher suggested they choose someone else because I wasn't light-skinned enough to captivate the audience,"" Adhiambo said. ""It shattered me because I began to question if there was something wrong with me or my skin. Am I not normal or pretty?""
Both Serena and Adhiambo shared that they have faced differential treatment due to their skin color. They recounted being called various unpleasant and hurtful names because of their darker complexion.
""I remember a classmate who was also a friend once called me 'Black widow'. It left me conflicted because I knew they said it because of my skin color,"" Serena recalled.
Adhiambo mentioned that she was often referred to as 'Blacky' by matatu touts and bodaboda operators—a term that emphasized her dark complexion. She noted that lighter-skinned people were often praised with terms like 'Rangi ya thao' for their fair skin.
Both women explained that Colourism initially affected their self-perception, but over time, they turned it into a catalyst for appreciating their natural beauty.
""For a long time, I struggled with low self-esteem and a negative self-image. I always felt judged before people even knew me,"" Adhiambo shared.
""We were treated differently, almost like second-class citizens. In my class, the lighter-skinned girls were often glorified, receiving better treatment and compliments about their beauty, while dark-skinned girls didn't receive the same recognition,"" Serena added.
Serena noted that she gradually developed resilience over the years. She surrounded herself with supportive people who helped her appreciate her skin tone.
""Over time, I learned not to let such comments or treatment affect me. I've always known that God created me this way for a reason. I knew my skin was unique and beautiful,"" Serena affirmed.
The media plays a crucial role in shaping young minds' views and perspectives. Serena noted that the shows she watched often glorified lighter-skinned women.
""In these shows, lighter-skinned girls were portrayed as disciplined and calm, while dark-skinned girls were depicted as loud and unruly,"" she observed.
Both women emphasized that learning to love and appreciate themselves required effort, affirmation, and self-love.
""I coped by affirming myself, accepting positive affirmations from others without hesitation, understanding that I am made in God's image, knowing my skin is beautiful, and seeing influential figures who look like me living confidently,"" Serena explained.
Adhiambo added that changing her perception was crucial: ""I've learned to embrace my dark complexion and recognize my own beauty.""
They both encouraged young dark-skinned girls to embrace their natural beauty and self-worth.
""To have such dark skin with melanin is a blessing. You are truly beautiful just as you are, so please remember that. Always affirm yourself so you won't accept any criticism about your skin tone,"" Serena encouraged.
""You are perfect as you are. Don't let anyone else define your beauty standards. Love and appreciate yourself. It's challenging, but if you don't love yourself, who will?"" concluded Adhiambo.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/be-patient-with-president-ruto-on-protests-stakeholder-engagement-gachagua-urges-kenyans-n344925,"Be patient with President Ruto on protests stakeholder engagement, Gachagua urges Kenyans
Mr Gachagua has also called for restraint, urging Kenyans to respect leaders and stop jeering MPs or destroying their properties over the Finance Bill 2024, which has already been rejected by the President.
The Deputy President said President Ruto has already kicked off consultations with various groups and stakeholders including the church leaders and business community to address the concerns raised by Gen-Z demonstrators.
""Let us give the President a chance to complete the consultation with all stakeholders including the business community and church leaders, among others. Things will stabilise soon and the country will be on a good trajectory of development,"" said Mr Gachagua on Saturday.
He said this while addressing Murang'a County residents at Kaharati Primary school grounds in Maragua Constituency, during the Maragua Education Endowment Fund. He also acknowledged greetings from thousands of people who turned up at Kenol Town.
Appealing to the Gen-Z to stop the protests, the Deputy President asked them to stop intimidating leaders over their stance on the Finance Bill 2024.
The Bill has since been rejected by President Ruto, who issued a memorandum.
""Let us give leaders an opportunity to serve us. There is no need to intimidate them, destroy their property or jeer them. There will be a right time to make a decision on whether to return them to office or not,"" said Mr Gachagua.
The Deputy President, who was in the company of various leaders, further said that the Government has considered the issues raised by Gen-Z protesters.
""To the Gen-Z protesters, we have listened and heard you. Our young children and teenagers have knowledge, we have experience. We can combine the two for the good of our nation,"" he said.
He continued: "" You have a valid point. We will take your suggestions. The President has already started the process of consultation. I will continue assisting the President"".
He further stated that the Mau Mau roads projects will continue and that the contractor will return to the site.
Mr Gachagua asked leaders to stop high octane politics, a statement that was echoed by the political leaders present at the event.
On reforms in the coffee sub-sector, the Deputy President asked officials of cooperative societies to avoid borrowing funds from lenders without the authority of the farmers.
"" It's time for work, not politics. Kenyans will have the opportunity to make leadership changes in the next election cycle. We are proud of what the DP is doing in his mandates including the fight against illicit brews and drugs and substance abuse. The elected leaders are working with the National Government Administration Officers to eradicate the vices. You have saved a generation in the initiative,"" said Maragua MP Mary Wamaua to the DP.
She said that on reforms in coffee, tea, avocado and dairy and other agricultural sectors the Deputy President has done well and the rural economy is roaring back.
""We support the Deputy President and President and we urge them to continue with the national unity agenda,"" said Kiambu Senator Karungo Thang'wa.
Urging political leaders to stick to development, the senator condemned a section of political leaders whom he said were confusing DP Gachagua's unity agenda with tribalism. He said they are misdirected.
Embakasi North MP James Gakuya, who is Chairperson of the National Assembly Committee on Trade, Industry and Cooperatives, said the Government has initiated deliberate programmes and policies in the trade and agriculture sector to create job and income opportunities.
He called on young political leaders to respect the Deputy President. He also said that there is no division at the Presidency.
MPs Jayne Kihara (Naivasha), Wambugu Wainaina (Othaya), Kamande Mwafrika (Roysambu) and Benjamin Gathiru Mejjadonk (Embakasi Central) and MCAs led by the host Kamahuha Ward Representative James Karanja Wa-kabera were also present.

They say the Kenyan market is ripe for the uptake of e-mobility with support from the government and other stakeholders.
The players were speaking at the unveiling of the new Moja EV electric vehicles showroom in Nairobi, the exclusive distributor of NETA Electric Vehicles in Kenya and the rest of Africa.
“We have no choice; the policy has to change. We will use Kenya to ship the cars to the rest of Africa with EVs,” said Eric Lumulas from Moja EV.
Vice President of NETA Electric Vehicles, Zhou Jiang, has also announced an ambitious plan to establish a cutting-edge manufacturing plant in Kenya to serve the entire African region.
The new showroom is showcasing new units from NETA Electric Vehicles which will cost Ksh.4 million, with negotiations underway for a financing plan with local banks.
“We are working towards having a financing solution to enable customers to acquire electric cars in Kenya as part of our sustainability efforts. We will be making an announcement soon,” remarked Catherine Gachanja, DTB Asset Finance Head.
Joy Wanyonyi, Head of Business at Associated Vehicle Assemblers (AVA), is rooting for local assembly of EVs to boost employment in the country, technology transfers, and growth of the sector.
“There is a national automotive policy that has not been assented. If duties are low, locally assembled EVs will be more affordable. That's what we are lobbying for the government to support,” said Wanyonyi.
Moja EV says it will also complement Kenya Power's efforts of setting up 100 charging stations in Nairobi, Mombasa, and other towns by the end of the year.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/your-advisors-have-failed-you-president-ruto-told-n344937,"Your advisors have failed you, President Ruto told
Some leaders have condemned the recent deployment
of Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) to peaceful protesters as witnessed in Nairobi
last week.
Kitui Senator Enock Wambua said deploying KDF personnel to the highways to suppress protesters is wrong as their job is
to protect Kenyan borders from external aggression.
Wambua said it was sad to see defence
forces sent to counter protesters whore are only carrying placards and twigs.
The Kitui senator added that President Ruto
should let the military stay in the barracks and call for a conversation to
know where the problem is.
“Kenya as a country is at a crossroads and
this has been brought by the bad leadership of the Kenya Kwanza government. As Azimio,
we warned him on the way to run the government and he ignored us,” Wambua said
on Saturday.
“Religious leaders, professional bodies and
ambassadors talked to Ruto he gave a deaf ear and now he has met with youth who
don’t care about tribalism, political parties, or religious divisions.”
Former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko said Generation
Z is the solution to the Kenya Kwanza government, which he described as
corrupt.
Sonko added that those around President Ruto
are misadvising and misleading him to introduce punitive taxes to the already
burdened Kenyan population.
“Gen Z will be the end of conmanship in
Kenya,” Sonko said.
He strongly condemned the killing of the
demonstrators and warned killer police officers of charges at the International
Criminal Court.
The leaders spoke at the Kamba customary
wedding of Wiper Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka’s daughter Saada Kalonzo in Yatta,
Machakos County.

Borno is at the centre of a 15-year Islamist insurgency that has killed thousands of people and displaced millions more. Although the Nigerian military has degraded the capabilities of the militants, they still carry out deadly attacks against civilians and security targets.
Barkindo Saidu, director general of the Borno State Emergency Management Agency, said suspected suicide bombers separately attacked a wedding, funeral and hospital, killing and injuring several people in the town of Gwoza.
Saidu said 18 deaths had been confirmed, a toll that included children, adults and pregnant women. ""The degree of injuries ranges from abdominal ruptures, scull fractures, and limb fractures,"" he said.

Carlos Alcaraz cheekily copied England Euro 2024 star Jude Bellingham's trademark goal celebration on Friday as he soaked up the adulation on Wimbledon's Centre Court.
The defending champion came through a tough five-setter against close friend Frances Tiafoe to reach the fourth round, where he will face America's Brandon Nakashima or 16th seed Ugo Humbert of France.
After the match he spread his arms wide as he walked around Centre Court, in homage to the England midfielder, who plays for his beloved Real Madrid.
Alcaraz, 21, said he had ""huge respect"" for Bellingham, who scored a spectacular overhead winner for England on Sunday against Slovakia in the last 16 in Germany.
The world number three also copied the footballer's celebration on court at last year's US Open, posting a picture on X captioned ""Hey, Jude"".
""We're in London,"" he said on Friday. ""He is England. So that's why. I told him that the big win deserves a big celebration.""

Excavators dug through piles of waste at a garbage dump surrounded by sunflower fields in Croatia on Thursday, searching for bodies of victims killed in war more than three decades ago, after remains of 10 people were found earlier this month.
The mass grave was located after two years of active searching at the Petrovacka Dola dump near Vukovar.
Investigators expect to find more remains, said Ivona Paltrinieri, who heads the department for missing people in the war veterans ministry.
Croatia is still trying to establish the fate of 1,797 missing people from its 1991-1995 war of independence from then-Yugoslavia, including 500 people missing from Vukovar-Srijem county, Paltrinieri said.
Investigators believe the victims found this month at the dump had been reburied there after initially being buried elsewhere, as they were covered with earth and sludge that is not typical for the site.
Paltrinieri said the remains were probably moved to the dump in January 1992, after the temporary occupation of Vukovar which was reduced to rubble by the Yugoslav army and Serb paramilitary units in a three-month siege in late 1991.
""In all these decades of search, this Petrovacka Dola location is the largest, the most extensive and most complex,"" she said.
""Until now, we have not had such a dump, where we dug 14 metres deep and excavated over 90,000 cubic meters of waste.""
""It's like looking for a needle in a haystack, to comb through the piles of garbage to find the mortal remains - I think it's incredible.""
The next step is the identification of the remains based on DNA analysis, matching the DNA with those of about 10,000 people who seek their missing relatives.
A total of 150 mass graves and a large number of individual graves have been found in Croatia since the war.
According to the International Commission for Missing Persons (ICMP), 11,600 people are still unaccounted for from the Balkan conflicts in the 1990s which broke out as Yugoslavia disintegrated into separate entities. Most are in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/petition-alleges-unlawful-appointment-of-ngcdf-managers-n345518,"Petition alleges unlawful appointment of NGCDF managers
A petition has been filed at the High
Court challenging the recruitment and appointment of fund managers at the
National Government Constituency Development Fund (NGCDF).
Ezekiel Otieno, the petitioner, argues
that the appointment of fund managers, in multiple constituencies, was done
illegally and was discriminatory and prejudicial to members of the public.
He further stated that the said
irregular appointments unfairly favoured NGCDF staff who were recruited without
adhering to due processes.
”The Applicant received credible and
verifiable information relating to the unlawful and irregular appointment of
fund managers by the 2nd Respondent in Embakasi South, Makadara, Mathare,
Kasipul Kabondo, Test South, Budalangi, Kimilili among many others,"" Otieno
argued in official court documents.
""They were appointed contrary to
the law which requires that public office be filled through a transparent,
competitive, inclusive, and merit-based recruitment process open to public
participation.""
Otieno
additionally claims that Yusuf Mbuno, the CEO of NGCDF, neglected to hire fund
account managers for several constituencies, thereby causing certain
constituencies to lag behind in terms of development.
""As required by
law, all constituencies should have a substantive fund account manager, this principle has been negated by the 2nd Respondent in the aforementioned
constituencies where there have been no substantive fund account managers for
years,"" said Otieno.
Otieno also stated that Mbuno has led to
unnecessary and wasteful public expenditure by allowing certain fund managers
to act indefinitely in their roles.
He further contended that his legitimate
expectations were violated by these actions, as the respondents exceeded their
authority in making these appointments.
“That the impugned appointments are
illegal and unconstitutional and, therefore, invalid, null and void,"" the
court papers read.
The court directed that the application be
served upon the respondents and that they present themselves before the bench
on July 23 for further direction.
“The
Court has considered the nature of the application dated 21.06.2024 and the
supporting affidavit and in the absence of
the parties order that the application be served forthwith in a day for interpartes
hearing or further orders on 23.07.2024 at 9.30am or soon thereafter as will be
called out per cause list and video link,” Justice Byram Ongaya directed.

Founded in 2019, Her Initiative is youth-first and women-led, aiming to equip young women with education, skills, and resources necessary for economic participation.
They employ innovative approaches such as the Panda Digital platform, which delivers educational courses via SMS to overcome digital barriers among young women with limited internet access. Additionally, their Digimali project supports young entrepreneurs in scaling their businesses online.
The King Baudouin Foundation's award includes €200,000 (approximately 560 million Tanzanian shillings or Ksh.24 million Kenya shillings) in funding, along with access to a network of international development professionals and organizations. This support will enable Her Initiative to expand its programs significantly, with a goal to reach an additional 100,000 women across East Africa over the next five years.
Lydia Charles Moyo, the Founder and Executive Director of Her Initiative, emphasizes the organization's origins in personal experiences of overcoming barriers like gender-based violence and lack of educational opportunities.
“We already support young women to build their financial resilience in six Tanzanian regions, but with the KBF Africa Prize we will be able to scale our work to help so many more women to achieve their dreams in Tanzania and beyond,” she said.
The KBF Africa Prize selection committee, impressed by Her Initiative's holistic approach and strategic use of technology and partnerships, highlighted its potential for further impact and recognition on a global scale.
“Coupled with its innovative use of modern technologies and strategic local partnerships, Her Initiative is a highly deserving recipient of this year’s KBF Africa Prize. We look forward to seeing what the team achieves in the years to come,” said Bilikiss Adebiyi-Abiola, Chair of the KBF Africa Prize Selection Committee 2023-2024.
Previous recipients of the KBF Africa Prize, such as Dr. Denis Mukwege and the Grameen Bank, have gone on to receive international accolades like the Nobel Peace Prize, underscoring the transformative potential of this award.

The team has been training hard for the past three weeks and head coach Simon Jawichre says they are fired up ahead of their second successive appearance in the World U20 trophy.
Kenya, who are the reigning African U20 champions are in Pool B alongside Uruguay, USA and Netherlands.
“The training and preparations have been good. It’s important that we’ve been in camp for over three weeks now, it helps the guys to be up to speed. It’s like when you’re revising for an exam, you put in the work, we’ve really if I may say revised and the boys are mentally in shape and I believe even physically we are in the best possible shape.”
Jawichre, who will be in charge of the team for his second assignment after a successful hunt in the Barthes Cup, says the squad has the necessary depth and experience to shine in the competition.
“The boys know where the problems were last year and it's easy for them now to look back and say this is the kind of level of competition we were at and what they need to do to compete properly, they understand what it takes to compete at that level.
“They’ve also been able to impact the same on the younger guys; last year we shipped in quite a number of scores so we are able to shut down where the issues were.”
The former Catholic Monks Director of Sports has a strategy to improve on last year’s results.
“Our target is to post better results so that comes with our training and our skill level in terms of not just the individual brilliance but the unit; we believe we should be defending better; we should be scoring better.
“So the general result we are saying for example in our pool we are four, the worst we can do is one loss but again one game at a time and for now we are focused on Uruguay.”

Published on: July 10, 2024 07:32 (EAT)
A record-breaking heat wave continued to grip the western United States on Tuesday, smashing records and endangering lives with little relief in sight.
Approximately 162 million people -- nearly one-half of the US population -- were living in areas under active heat warnings, according to the National Weather Service.
It said in a post on X the ""dangerous heat"" was expected to remain in the western part of the country for the rest of the week before moving eastward over the weekend, warning ""the persistent and record-breaking heat is extremely dangerous to those without access to cooling.""
Among places that saw records shattered was Las Vegas, Nevada, which recorded its all-time high temperature of 120 degrees Fahrenheit (48.9 degrees Celsius) on Sunday.
In Texas, the White House declared a federal emergency after the storm Beryl had left some 2 million without power as of Tuesday evening.
""The greatest concern right now is the power outages and extreme heat that is impacting Texans,"" President Joe Biden said in a statement.
Meanwhile the southeastern United States and East Coast saw sweltering temperatures of their own, with heat advisories and excessive heat warnings in effect from Florida to Massachusetts.
The heat has been directly attributed to several deaths along the US West Coast.
In Death Valley, California, on Saturday, a motorcyclist died of suspected heat exposure and another was hospitalized, according to National Park Service officials.
The area, known as one of the hottest places on Earth, recorded a temperature of 128F (53C).
Further north, four men in the Portland, Oregon area have died since Friday as a result of heat-related illnesses, according to local newspaper The Oregonian.
Though the Pacific Northwest is known as being generally more temperate than the deserts in the US Southwest, temperatures there remained elevated Tuesday after the Oregon capital Salem hit a daily record of 103 degrees (39.3 degrees Celsius) over the weekend.
""This is a record-breaking heat wave,"" Daniel Swain, a climate scientist with the University of California, Los Angeles, said during an online news conference over the weekend.
Some people in California, he said, had seen ""not only the hottest day they've ever experienced but also the hottest day that their parents or grandparents ever would have experienced.""
The high temperatures also contributed to extreme fire conditions in California, where thousands of acres burned in active wildfires up and down the state.
Northwest of Santa Barbara, the Lake Fire burned nearly 27,000 acres (110 square kilometers), prompting evacuations and road closures Tuesday.
The heat wave comes in the aftermath of the Earth's hottest June ever recorded, according to the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service.
Recurring heat waves are a marker of climate change caused by humanity's use of fossil fuels, according to scientists.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/cabinet-sacked-what-next-lessons-from-kibakis-purge-of-2005-n345682,"Cabinet sacked: What next? Lessons from Kibaki's purge of 2005
In a 12-minute speech, Ruto announced that the decision would not affect his deputy and Prime CS Musalia Mudavadi.
He explained that he would engage in extensive consultations across different sectors before reconstituting a new cabinet without providing any timelines.
President Ruto's play to calm the hearts of raging Gen Zs who had threatened to return to the streets mirrored former President Mwai Kibaki's move in 2005 when he sacked his entire cabinet days after a national referendum.
Background
In the 2005 referendum, over 3.5 million Kenyans rejected the draft constitution that Kibaki had strongly supported.
""Following the results of the referendum, it has become necessary for me, as the President of the Republic, to re-organize my Government to make it more cohesive and better able to serve the people of Kenya,"" Kibaki said.
""Accordingly, in accordance with the powers conferred upon me under the Constitution of Kenya, I have directed that the offices of all Ministers and all Assistant Ministers become vacant. Consequently, the occupants of the said offices cease to hold their respective offices with immediate effect.""
The strong opposition against the draft constitution dated back to 2003 when Kibaki's administration came into power and pledged to provide a more democratic governance within his first 100 days.
This resulted in a proposed Constitution drafted by the governing National Rainbow Coalition. However, at the time, internal wrangles came into play leading to disagreements on several contentious issues within the document.
Prior to the 2002 elections, politicians who formed a coalition with the ruling party made verbal and written agreements on matters governance and were aggrieved when some of their issues were not honoured. This resulted in deep rifts between individuals and parties.
A section of the CSs who opposed the law argued that it provided the presidency with utmost powers, something that they sought to get rid of especially following the Daniel Moi regime.
On the other hand, supporters of the draft document dismissed the claims of supremacy in the presidency and noted that powers such as appointments would be subject to vetting and approval by parliament.
Despite a wide campaign for the draft Constitution, Kibaki failed to convince Kenyans to vote for the draft Constitution, with critics saying that the former president sought to ease the tension that succeeded the 2002 elections.
At the time, President Ruto, who was in the opposition, said that Kibaki had his work cut out for him to appeal to Kenyans.
""I don't think the president has an option, but to begin to respect the institutions of governance that are there. The major split and confusion and quarrels over the last three years have basically been the president ignoring the institutions that are there. He needs to respect the agreements he has with his coalition partners,"" Ruto told VOA in 2005.
What happens next?
During Kibaki's era, former head of Presidential Press Service Isiah Kabira said that former Vice President Moody Awori and Permanent Secretaries would run the government alongside Kibaki for two weeks before he named a new Cabinet.
Ruto in his speech confirmed that the operations of government would continue uninterrupted under the guidance of Principal Secretaries and other relevant officials.

Luis de la Fuente's Spain are the form team of Euro 2024 but face tournament specialists France in Tuesday's semi-final in Munich.
Spain have lit up Euro 2024, winning all five games while scoring 11 goals and are just one win away from the final.
To get there however, Spain will need to go through a France side who while not impressing in Germany have shown their expertise and experience at major tournaments to navigate their way to the final four.
France have only scored three goals at Euro 2024, none of which have come from general play.
Misfiring captain Kylian Mbappe, playing in a specialised mask due to a broken nose sustained in the opening fixture against Austria, has scored from the spot once, while the French have benefited from two own goals.
Led by coach Didier Deschamps however, France have shown the necessary nous and guile to go within one game of their fourth final in the last five major tournaments.
- 'We're in the semi-finals' -
With a 25-year-old captain and one of the youngest squads at Euro 2024, it is easy to overlook how the French have established themselves as the dominant force in European football over the past decade.
Since a quarter-final defeat by eventual champions Germany at the 2014 World Cup, France have made the final at every major tournament other than Euro 2020.
That run includes a World Cup triumph in 2018 and a loss on penalties to Argentina in Qatar four years later, along with an extra-time defeat by Portugal at Euro 2016 on home soil.
The importance of France's experience at major tournaments has been clear in Germany. Despite a run to the semis, the French have failed to impress.
France are yet to score from general play, with only an Mbappe penalty and two own goals in the plus column.
That 1-0 loss to Germany, just over 10 years ago, was their last defeat in regulation time at a major competition.
Midfielder Adrien Rabiot said France had full faith even if they are yet to light the tournament on fire.
""We've always talked about it being a team game, needing a team effort. It's the case for all recent competitions we've played in and is the case at this Euros.
""Even if we've had difficulties, we're in the semi-finals.""
A self-described pragmatist, coach Deschamps said Monday results are what matters at major tournaments.
""Maybe it's not the same as it was in the past, but we do have the capability to spark emotions and make lots of French men and women happy with our results.""
De la Fuente shot down suggestions France were boring, but said Spain's game plan ""is closer to a nice show, a nice spectacle, if we do it right.
""In that respect, we're a nice team to watch.""
Spain have scored 11 goals through eight different goalscorers, posing threats across the park.
The Spain coach echoed his counterpart's statements, even if he admitted ""at this stage, it's about winning.
""France have a fantastic team. I enjoy watching football. I have fun watching football and it's fun to watch the French.""
But with Pedri out of the tournament with injury and Spain missing defenders Dani Carvajal and Robin le Normand due to yellow card suspensions, France may sense an opportunity.
Coming in for Carvajal is right back Jesus Navas. At 38, Navas is older than the combined age of wingers Nico Williams, 21, and 16-year-old Lamine Yamal.
The Sevilla winger does however boast experience as the last remaining member of Spain's golden generation, who won two Euros titles either side of a World Cup from 2008 to 2012.
If Spain are to win on Tuesday and book their spot in Sunday's final, Navas may enjoy the rare honour of being part of the start of another golden generation of Spanish football.

Four people were on Friday night killed in a
tragic road accident on the Nairobi-Murang’a highway.
The deceased were enroute to

Murang’a Police Commander Mathiu
Kaingi said one of the vehicles, which was reportedly being driven under the
influence, hit another car which in-turn rolled over to the other lane and hit
a bus, which was at high speed.
The police boss said further
investigations have been launched into the incident.
“Tumeweka bidii tuweze kuwakamata

During a press briefing outside Parliament, Sakaja on Thursday explained that he had returned to the city following a retreat alongside his cabinet to restructure county operations for the new financial year.
He criticised politicians who sought to gain political mileage by invoking his name as one of those who allegedly planned violence.
The governor called for politicians to embrace his mantra ""siasa safi"" whereby all opinions are considered regardless of one's affiliation.
""I saw a clip on Tuesday on alleged goons coming out of City Hall which I have asked to be investigated. We have been in the Coast with our cabinet for the whole week just doing our end-of-year retreat and replanning for the new financial year which ends in June. I would hate it that something would have been planned from City Hall,"" he said.
""When you're in such a situation, the first casualty is the truth. Opportunistic politicians try to bring themselves into a move to taint their opponents. When somebody tries to claim that I was meeting people to plan violence at City Hall while I was in Diani from Sunday and I've come back this morning. I've always believed in siasa safi and freedom of expression even when it's not in my political side of the equation.""
A section of City Hall was set on fire during the second week of anti-government protests. The building currently houses Governor Sakaja's office. Eyewitnesses claimed that angry youths chased away county askaris outside the building which allowed them to gain entry and set the office on fire.
This happened shortly after protestors had gained entry into Parliament buildings on Tuesday, June 25.

A total of 39 people have been killed in anti-government protests in Kenya that erupted last month over planned tax hikes, the national rights watchdog said Monday, a tally double what the government has admitted so far.
The updated toll was announced by the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights on the eve of an expected new round of demonstrations led mostly by Gen-Z activists against the government of President William Ruto.
""Data from our records indicates that thirty-nine people have died and three hundred and sixty-one injured in relation to the protests countrywide,"" the state-funded body said in a statement, adding that the figures covered the period from June 18 to July 1.
It also said there had been 32 cases of ""enforced or involuntary disappearances"" and 627 arrests of protesters.
""The Commission continues to condemn in the strongest terms possible the unwarranted violence and force that was inflicted on protesters, medical personnel, lawyers, journalists and on safe spaces such as churches, medical emergency centres and ambulances,"" it said.
""We maintain that the force used against the protesters was excessive and disproportionate.""
Fresh protests have been called by activists starting from Tuesday despite Ruto announcing last week that the bill containing the contentious tax hikes would be withdrawn.
Ruto said in a television interview Sunday that 19 people had died in the protests, but insisted he was not to blame.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/govt-to-save-ksh12-billion-by-scraping-budget-allocated-to-spouses-of-ruto-gachagua-n345132,"Gov’t to save Ksh.1.2 billion by scrapping budget allocated to spouses of Ruto, Gachagua
In a media interview on Sunday, Ruto promised to cut on non-essential expenses in his office as well as enforce budgetary cuts on the Judiciary, Parliament, counties, and the executive.
Despite appearing to cede to the people’s will, President Ruto warned of dire consequences that the country will face for not passing the Finance Bill, which includes borrowing Ksh.1 trillion to keep the government operational.
According to Ruto, the expenditure in the said arms of government should reflect the country’s state of affairs.
One of the promises Ruto made was to scrap budgets allocated to offices of First Lady Rachel Ruto, and that of Second Lady Dorcas Rigathi.
The Billions allocated to spouses' offices
As it stands, the government will save Ksh.1.2 billion for dropping budgetary allocations to the two offices which Kenyans have termed as unconstitutional.
In the 2024/25 budget, the Office of Rachel Ruto was allocated Ksh.696 million, Ksh.100 million more than the previous financial year.
Pastor Dorcas Rigathi’s office was allocated Ksh.557 million, a reduction of Ksh.160 million from the 2023/24 budget.
In February 2023, another unconstitutional spousal office was unveiled – the Office of the Spouse to The Prime Cabinet Secretary. Held by Tessie Mudavadi, the spouse to Musalia Mudavadi.
The office sparked uproar from the public, with Mudavadi stating that the office is not funded by taxpayers.
""I want to state very clearly that there is no public expenditure that has occurred in the conversation around Tessie Musalia,"" he said.
The Executive budget
In his newly outlined austerity measures, Ruto also hinted at budget cuts in the executive, which received a large amount of allocations.
State House was allocated Ksh.9.4 billion, followed by the Office of the President (Ksh.5 billion), office of the Deputy President (Ksh.4.9 billion) and Office of the Prime Cabinet Secretary (Ksh.1.1 billion).
The Ksh.9.4 billion allocated to State House is inclusive of the Ksh.696 million allocated to the First Lady. The funds are aimed at fulfil constitutional mandates, facilitating strategic initiatives under the Office of the First Lady, policy advisory, improvement of State Houses and State Lodges and administration of benefits for retired presidents, Vice Presidents and other designated State Offices.
Ruto said that the Judiciary and Parliament, which received Ksh.24.6 billion and Ksh44.6 billion respectively, will also face budget cuts. It is unclear how much will be reduced from these institutions.
The salary budget
Another avenue that the president committed to deal with was the ballooning wage bill by reducing salaries. He offered to lead the charge by having a reduction of his salary and the same to be done across government.
The president takes home Ksh.1.4 million gross salary, Deputy President Ksh.1.2 million and the Prime CS Ksh.990,000. MPs and Senators take home Ksh.739,600 while governors’ pay amounts to Ksh.990,000.
One of the grievances fronted by the Gen Zs included a reduction of MPs' salaries to Ksh.200,000 as part of the austerity measures. This means that the expenditure for MPs would reduce from Ksh.258 million to Ksh.69 million monthly.

The ten-time African champions are sharpening their claws ahead of the 2024 Women’s Volleyball Challenger Cup scheduled for July 4-7 in Manila, Philippines before heading to the French capital for the Summer Games which run from July 26 to August 11.
While the Kenyan lasses have underlined their name as Africa's top dog, they have had years of constant heartbreak on the world stage but Trizah, who has replaced Mercy Moim as the team’s captain, says they are ready to leave a mark this year.
“The competitions ahead of us are tough. We are going to meet top teams in the world but we are up to the task. We carry the pride of Africa and we will not be pushovers.”
Atuka has lauded the sponsors who have come on board to boost their preparations ahead of the two assignments.
“We are currently under NOCK and we have received adequate support from them. Sponsors have also come in handy. The morale is high in the camp and we are aiming to reflect that in the Philippines and France. We have trained well and we are ready for the assignments,” she added.
Malkia Strikers received a supplement of two million shillings in addition to the 15 million shillings they were given by a betting firm earlier this year to boost their preparations ahead of the global showpieces.
Head coach Japheth Munala says despite being pooled against world-beaters, they will use the underdog tag to their advantage.
‘We are going to meet Puerto Rico in the Challenger Cup. They stunned us 3-1 in the last outing and this time round we will turn things around. We also have been pooled with top teams in the Olympics, Japan, Brazil and Poland are all top teams but we are confident we shall get points from them.”
Malkia Strikers have been in a training camp at Kasarani Indoor Arena for the past two weeks and three players will be dropped from the 19-member squad for the Challenger Cup and a further three for the Olympic Games.
Munala promised that the final squad selection will be based on ability to defend the court, attack and consistency in training. Ability to play at the international stage will also be key for the selection of the Olympic squad.
The reigning African champions are scheduled to leave for Challenger Cup which begins on July 4 in the Philippines before pitching camp in Miramas, France for a high-performance camp ahead of the Paris Olympics.

https://www.citizen.digital/opinion-blogs/the-erosion-of-democracy-how-politicians-use-goons-to-silence-dissent-n345376,"The erosion of democracy: How politicians use goons to silence dissent
In contemporary political
landscapes, the deployment of goons and hooliganism to suppress demonstrations
has become an increasingly troubling tactic. This strategy not only undermines
the democratic process but also erodes public trust in political institutions
and leaders.
The deliberate use of violence and
intimidation to silence dissent represents a cynical manipulation of power that
prioritizes political survival over the rights and voices of the citizenry.
Often, when violence and
intimidation fail, politicians resort to co-opting the ringleaders of dissent
to cripple the movement. This begs the question: why do politicians find it
difficult to address the grievances of protesting citizens and curb growing
economic stagnation? Politicians often make decisions to deal with
national issues are impractical and short-sighted.
In recent political discourse, the
controversial finance bill led to a massive youth revolt. Initially, the
protest was peaceful, with its frontliners, the Gen Zs, invoking Article 37 of
the Kenyan constitution. However, subsequent protests were increasingly marred
by violence, with the belief that hired goons hijacked them.
Hooliganism is rampant in the
political space. Political leaders with questionable characters often
incentivize and suppress dissent when faced with opposition. Some seek the
services of goons or an army of thugs to intimidate and silence opposition,
furthering the wishes of their political patrons. Such leaders will do whatever
it takes to remain in power.
These leaders exploit the high
unemployment rate to create unorthodox jobs for idle youths who readily accept
assignments due to a lack of alternatives. Such leaders also deploy strategies
such as ""Divide and Rule"" to extend their reign.
This tactic involves playing tribal
politics, where ethnic groups are manipulated to develop hatred against each other naturally. The instigator of this divisive ideology then positions
themselves as a saviour or mediator to please the warring parties and bolster
their political career.
Any sign of unity, as witnessed in
the Gen Z protest, is usually a threat to crafty politicians as it undermines
the ""Divide and Rule"" strategy upon which their power is founded.
The ""Divide and Rule"" or
""Divide and Conquer"" tactic was very effective during the scramble
and partition of Africa by colonizers. It aimed at maintaining control over
opponents by encouraging dissent between them, thereby preventing them from
uniting.
What are the side effects of using goons to disrupt
demonstrations?
Erosion
of Democratic Values
The essence of democracy lies in the
freedom of expression and the right to peaceful assembly. By employing goons to
disrupt protests, politicians nullify these fundamental rights. This approach
fosters a culture of fear, discouraging citizens from exercising their
democratic rights and stifling public discourse.
When people are afraid to voice
their concerns due to potential violence, democracy is rendered hollow. Fear
and threats are recipes for bad governance. When politicians successfully instil
fear in citizens, they abandon the Constitution and operate based on personal
interests.
Politicians should be willing to be
challenged when they contravene acceptable standards as a way of strengthening
the democratic space. Contrary to this fact, self-centred leaders opt to keep
the citizenry in the dark to advance their unconstitutional agendas.
Democracy should not only exist in writing but
also practice. The right to freedom of expression should be upheld at all
times to keep the government in check. Public criticism plays a critical role
in the development of a nation and can be achieved in the absence of threats,
intimidation, and fear.
Undermining
Public Trust
Public trust in political
institutions is a cornerstone of a stable society. When politicians resort to
hooliganism to quell opposition, it sends a clear message that these
institutions are willing to engage in unethical and illegal activities to
maintain control.
This behaviour erodes the credibility
of leaders and institutions, leading to widespread cynicism and disengagement
among the populace. The long-term consequence is a weakened social fabric and
increased political apathy. A leader is a reflection of society.
When a leader is detached from
societal norms, public mistrust emerges. A leader needs to listen and fulfil
the needs of the electorate. Listening is a sign of respect, and it builds
trust.
The
Human Cost
The human cost of using goons to
silence dissent cannot be overlooked. Individuals participating in
demonstrations often face physical harm, psychological trauma, and, in extreme
cases, loss of life.
This tactic also incites further
violence, leading to a vicious cycle of unrest and repression. The societal
impact is profound, as communities are torn apart, and the collective trauma
lingers long after the immediate conflict has subsided.
Unleashing goons on peaceful
protesters is a threat to general stability. The populace withholds critical
information for fear of being targeted. The high level of intolerance that
comes with hooliganism causes disturbances in the community.
Lives lost during deadly
confrontations rob families of breadwinners and render children orphans.
Parents lose children to such unpleasant events. The anti-finance bill protests
claimed at least 39 lives, with over 300 injuries.
With hired goons hijacking the
peaceful protests, massive damages were witnessed. Hooligans pelted stones,
burned, and looted both private and public establishments. Individual
businesses were crippled, workplaces vandalized, and the reality of
unemployment dawned on formerly employed citizens.
Article 37 guarantees the right to
peacefully protest and picket. This can continue until the government meets the
grievances of the protesters. Most governments resort to force to dispel dissidents
to prevent a negative image from reaching the international community.
A
Call for Ethical Leadership
The use of goons and hooliganism
indicates the failure of ethical leadership. True leaders should engage with
dissenting voices, addressing grievances through dialogue and reform rather
than suppression and violence.
Political leaders must uphold
democratic principles, ensuring that all citizens can freely express their
views without fear of retribution. Political parties have adopted biased
practices that have always worked against the needs of the populace.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/insight-israels-next-headache-who-will-run-post-war-gaza-n345074,"Insight: Israel's next headache: who will run post-war Gaza?
The plan for post-war Gaza that Israel pitched to U.S. allies is to run the strip in cooperation with powerful local families. But there's a problem: in a place where Hamas still wields ruthless influence, none want to be seen talking to the enemy.
Israel is under pressure from Washington to end the loss of human life and wind down its military offensive after nearly nine months, but does not want Hamas in charge after the war.
Israeli officials have therefore been trying to plot a path ahead for the day after the fighting stops.
A major pillar of the plan, according to public statements from leading Israeli officials, was to shape an alternative civil administration involving local Palestinian actors not part of the existing structures of power and willing to work alongside Israel.
However, the only plausible candidates in Gaza for this role – the heads of powerful local families – are unwilling to get involved, according to Reuters' conversations with five members of major families in Gaza, including the head of one grouping.
Israel has been ""actively looking for local tribes and families on the ground to work with them,"" said Tahani Mustafa, Senior Palestine Analyst at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank. ""They refused.""
They don’t want to get involved, in part because they fear retribution from Hamas, said Mustafa, who is in touch with some of the families and other local stakeholders in Gaza.
That threat is real because – despite Israel's explicit war objective of destroying Hamas – the Palestinian group still has operatives enforcing its will on the streets of Gaza, according to six residents who spoke to Reuters.
Asked what the outcome would be for any head of Gaza's powerful families if they cooperate with Israel, Ismail Al-Thawabta, director of the Hamas-run government media office in Gaza, said: ""I expect it to be lethal.""
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged the challenges last week, saying in an interview with Israel's Channel 14 TV station that the defence ministry had already made attempts to reach out to Gaza clans but ""Hamas eliminated"" them.
He said the defence ministry had a new plan, but would not give details other than specifying he was not willing to bring in the Palestinian Authority, which currently governs the occupied West Bank.
Reuters could not establish if Israel's efforts to work with the families were ongoing.
Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant discussed post-war plans at a meeting in Washington last week with U.S. officials.
Briefing reporters during the visit, Gallant said: ""The only solution for the future of Gaza is governance by local Palestinians. It cannot be Israel and cannot be Hamas.""
He did not mention the clans specifically.
Contacted for comment, the prime minister's officer referred Reuters to Netanyahu's previous public comments on the topic. Israel's defence ministry did not respond to Reuters questions.
Israel launched its offensive in Gaza in response to a Hamas-led cross-border raid on Oct. 7 last year in which around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed and about 250 people taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies.
Palestinian health authorities say Israel's ground and air campaign in Gaza has killed nearly 38,000 people, mostly civilians. Israel says many of the dead are Palestinian combatants.
Gaza has dozens of powerful families who function as well-organised clans. Many do not have formal links to Hamas.
They derive their power from controlling businesses and command the loyalty of hundreds or thousands of relatives. Each family has a leader, known as a mukhtar.
British colonial rulers of Palestine before the state of Israel was created in 1948 relied heavily on mukhtars to govern. After Hamas took over Gaza in 2007, it curtailed the power of the families. But they have retained a degree of autonomy.
Israel does already speak to some Gaza merchants, to coordinate commercial shipments through a southern checkpoint. Residents are reluctant to disclose any interactions with Israel.
The approaches from Israel described by members of the Gaza clans were modest in scope but different: they were about practical issues inside Gaza itself, and focused on the north of the strip, where Israel says it is concentrating its civil governance efforts.
One of Gaza's clan leaders, who asked not to be named, told Reuters Israeli officials had contacted other mukhtars – though not him - in the past few weeks. He said he knew about it because the recipients of the calls told him about the calls.
He said the Israeli officials wanted ""some respected and influential people"" to help with aid deliveries in northern Gaza.
""I expect that mukhtars will not cooperate with these games,"" he said, citing anger with Israel over its offensive, which has killed clan members and destroyed property.
The person, whose clan is a major player in agriculture and the Gaza import business, has no formal connection to Hamas.
In another contact between Israel and influential Gazans, officials from the Israeli defence ministry have in the past two weeks contacted two major Gaza business owners in the food sector, according to a Palestinian briefed on the contacts.
It was unclear what the Israeli side wanted to talk about, and the business owners, who are from the north of Gaza, refused to engage with the Israelis, according to the person.
A senior member of a different clan said Israeli officials had not contacted his clan, but would be given short shrift if they did.
""We are not collaborators. Israel should stop these games,"" the clan member, who also has no formal connection to Hamas, told Reuters.
Israeli National Security Advisor Tzachi Hanegbi, speaking last week, said the government had authorized the Israeli armed forces to find ""a local leadership, willing to live side by side with Israel and not to devote its life to killing Israelis.""
Speaking through a translator at a conference, he said the process was starting in the northern part of Gaza, and practical results should be seen soon.
Besides civil administration, the other pillars of Israel’s plan for post-war Gaza include bringing in a security force from outside to keep order, seeking international help with reconstruction, and searching for a long-term peace settlement.
The Arab states whose support Israel would need say they won't get involved unless Israel agrees a firm timeline for a Palestinian state – something Netanyahu says he will not be pushed into doing.
Throughout the war, Washington has advocated for reforms to strengthen the Palestinian Authority (PA) and prepare it to govern Gaza, which it used to run.
Netanyahu has said he doesn't trust the PA, which in turn says he seeks to keep Gaza and the West Bank divided. Support is weak among Gazans for the PA, according to a June 12 poll by the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research (PCPSR).
However, two U.S. officials told Reuters Netanyahu may have little choice but to turn security over to the PA.
""It's going to be a fight. But there is no other short-to-medium term option,"" said one of the officials.
Israel has yet to develop a concrete post-war plan for governance and security in the enclave, said the officials, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
Both said Israeli officials were considering a range of ideas but did not provide details.
The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
While some Gazans blame Hamas for inciting the war, others, angered and radicalised by Israel's offensive, have drawn closer to the group, with its declared commitment to destroying Israel, PCPSR polls show.
Hamas has recognized it is unlikely to govern after the war, but expects to retain influence.
A Gaza resident said he saw members of the Hamas police force touring the streets of Gaza City in June, warning merchants against hiking prices.
They were in plain clothes instead of their usual uniforms, and moved on bicycles, said the resident, who asked not be named fearing reprisal.
Hamas fighters have intervened to control aid shipments, including killing some clan figures at the start of this year who tried to take over the shipments in Gaza City, according to four residents from the city who spoke to Reuters.
Hamas declined to comment about the killings.
In April, Hamas said its security services arrested several members of a security apparatus loyal to the Palestinian Authority. Three people close to the PA said the arrested men were escorting a delivery of aid to northern Gaza Strip.
""There is no vacuum in Gaza, Hamas is still the prominent power,"" said Michael Milshtein, a former colonel in Israeli military intelligence who now heads the Palestinian Studies Forum at the Moshe Dayan Center, a research center in Israel.

Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said during a visit to Washington on Wednesday that his country did not want war in Lebanon, but could send it back to the ""Stone Age"" if diplomacy failed.
""We don't want to get into a war because it's not good for Israel. We have the ability to take Lebanon back to the Stone Age, but we don't want to do it,"" Gallant told reporters on the last day of the visit.
""We do not want war, but we are preparing for every scenario,"" he said.
""Hezbollah understands very well that we can inflict massive damage in Lebanon if a war is launched.""
Fears of an all-out war in Lebanon have risen in recent weeks as violent exchanges between Israel and the Iran-backed militant group have intensified.
The two sides have been trading regular cross-border fire ever since Hezbollah ally Hamas' October 7 attack on southern Israel sparked the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip.
Gallant said Wednesday that Israel had killed more than 400 Hezbollah ""terrorists"" in recent months.
According to an AFP tally, at least 481 people have died in Lebanon as a result of the Israel-Hezbollah clashes since October 7, including 94 civilians.
On the Israeli side, at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed, according to Israel.
Lebanon's national news agency reported an Israeli strike on Wednesday night that destroyed a building in Nabatiyeh, wounding five people who were in the vicinity.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/every-day-is-a-test-for-joe-biden-with-his-presidential-campaign-in-question-n345675,"Every day is a test for Joe Biden with his presidential campaign in question
His next big test comes Thursday, when Biden holds a solo press conference at the NATO summit, his first time facing the press alone since November. He has held press conferences with leaders from Ukraine, Kenya and Japan in 2024.
Biden, 81, will take an unspecified number of questions from reporters, in an event expected to last about as long as November's, which ran 21 minutes.
Ahead of that event scheduled for 5:30 p.m. (2130 GMT), the White House was busily helping prepare the president for it by trying to game out the questions reporters would ask, a knowledgeable source said.
In the two weeks since the June 27 debate, Biden had another disappointing performance in an ABC News interview, reinforcing some Democrats' concerns over his ability to beat Republican rival Donald Trump in the Nov. 5 election or serve another four years.
But Biden has also participated in a wide array of public events without a slip-up, including campaign stops in North Carolina, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Virginia.
A well-orchestrated, forceful NATO summit speech on Tuesday closed with Biden carefully placing the Presidential Medal of Freedom around Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg's neck, to the relief of fellow Democrats and White House staff.
Every Biden appearance will be scrutinized, in perpetuity, analysts said.
Larry Sabato, head of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, said Biden is in ""highly unusual"" territory for an American president.
""If it's a little mistake, slurring a word or something, I think people would just let it pass. But if there is anything approaching what we saw at the debate, the Democratic Party would be thrown into turmoil,"" Sabato said.
Even if Biden never repeats his debate behavior, he faces a risk that momentum to push him aside could still grow.
MORE INTERVIEWS, PRESS CONFERENCES
Some Democrats have suggested that putting Biden into the public eye more often would help ease concerns.
Over the course of his three-and-a-half years in office, Biden has held fewer press conferences and interviews combined than presidents dating to Ronald Reagan in the 1980s at the same point in their presidency, data by presidential scholar Martha Joynt Kumar showed.
He has held an average of 10.5 press conferences per year, compared to 22 per year for Trump and 35.5 for George H.W. Bush, according to an analysis by the University of California at Santa Barbara. Reagan had fewer with 5.8 per year.
Biden answered more questions than either Bill Clinton or Barack Obama, but fewer than either George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, and far fewer than Trump.
After Thursday's news conference, Biden's next big interview will be with NBC anchor Lester Holt on Monday.
""There will be a lot of eyes on every move Biden makes,"" said a Democratic strategist with close ties to the White House. ""There'll be closer scrutiny - everything he says and does.""
Biden's top aides are thinking about performance hurdles and his day-to-day appearances in three phases: Get through a big speech on civil rights in Austin, Texas on Monday, then the Democratic convention in Chicago where Biden is to be formally nominated in mid-August and from there the final push to Election Day on Nov. 5, a source with direct knowledge said.
His Texas speech at the presidential library of 1960s President Lyndon Johnson may draw parallels with Johnson, who withdrew from the Democratic race in 1968 over his handling of the Vietnam War.
Biden, a career politician, had a history of saying the wrong thing as a much younger man.
As president, he has taken fire for saying the United States would defend Taiwan militarily if the Asian country was invaded by China, a policy that had been ambiguous, and for calling Chinese leader Xi Jinping a ""dictator.""
Recently, the White House and Biden have limited informal interactions with reporters that yield impromptu answers to shouted questions as he's traveling or leaving an event. In 2021, Biden had 158 ""exchanges with reporters,"" the UC Santa Barbara project found. He has had just 38 this year through June 9.
There's a still long way to go for the incumbent president before the election. Looming ahead: Another debate against Trump scheduled for Sept. 10.

The demonstrators have vowed to stage a daring march to State House as the climax of a seven-day protest to express their anger and dissatisfaction with the current government of President William Ruto.
After the deadly rallies witnessed on Tuesday when the protestors invaded Parliament in protest of the Finance Bill 2024, security teams appear determined to thwart any attempt to access the House on the Hill.
Elite security teams have sealed off all roads leading to and connecting to State House, with motorists being diverted to use alternative routes.
Heavily armed officers have also been strategically placed near State House with no one allowed to even approach any of the entrances.
Military security equipment has also been deployed near State House to barricade the roads near State House.
Despite President William Ruto conceding and accepting to withdraw the contentious Bill, the protesters have vowed to continue with the rallies in a show of no-confidence with the Kenya Kwanza government.
The plan by the protesters to march to State House has been met with mixed opinion with fears of loss of lives being voiced to dissuade the youth from such an act billed as treasonous.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/kaptagat-cycling-challenge-attracts-africas-top-talent-n345331,"Kaptagat cycling challenge attracts Africa’s top talent
This development follows the successful launch of the Annual Kaptagat Cycling Challenge, which attracted over 100 cyclists across various categories, notably including Ugandan cyclist Charles Kagimu, who will represent the East African country in the Paris 2024 Olympics road race.
Kagimu secured third place in the Elite Men's Category, with his fellow countryman Lawrence Lorot taking first prize and Kenya's Geoffrey Lagat coming in second.
Speaking after the race, the elite cyclist, who trains at the INEOS Eliud Kipchoge Academy in Kaptagat and is a member of the Kenyan Riders Cycling team, expressed his commitment to forest conservation.
“This motivates me because you cannot really cycle in a forest if someone did not plant a tree. I have to take part in the tree planting,” he said. “Representing my country Uganda in the Olympics means a lot to me, and Kenya is my home too because I train here in Kaptagat Forest.”
The cycling challenge, organised by WWF-Kenya in partnership with a local community-based organisation, the Kaptagat Integrated Conservation Programme, is a sports-for-conservation initiative aimed at enhancing livelihoods while raising awareness and mobilising the public to join the climate action movement.
“I am happy to cycle within the forest. It provides us with good fresh air and shade, and some trees even act as windbreakers. The race went well, and I managed to break away. I was thrilled with the win,” added Lorot, who won the race with a time of 01:37:02.
Elite men winners Lawrence Lorot, Geoffrey Lagat and Charles Kagimu
Berber Kramer, a cyclist working for an international non-governmental organisation in Nairobi, Kenya, and representing Zuzu Bike Shop, clinched victory in the Elite Women's race. Grace Kaviro secured second place, while Monica Jelimo rounded out the podium in third. Jelimo also coincidentally emerged in the African Cross-Country Mountain Bike Championship.
“During the race, I wanted to stop and take a picture. I even told the guy I was with, ‘Oh, I want to stop and take a picture,’” exclaimed Kramer at the finish line. “But of course, you are not going to stop in the middle of a race and take a picture. Cycling for forests is great. When you are on your bike, it is amazing to be in a forest and to go through it. To experience cycling in such a beautiful environment was amazing.”
""Planting trees, therefore, is my contribution to climate action, and racing in a place full of trees is amazing. Racing against some of the top riders made this event significant for me, especially in this ecosystem. You do not suffer as much, especially with the sun. I have raced in places with no trees, and it is very different,"" Jelimo added.
The Elite women Winners Berber Kramer, Grace Kaviro and Monica Jelimo
In the paracycling category, Gabriel Ambuko emerged as the winner, followed closely by Samuel Mwangi. Only two cyclists registered for this category. Speaking after the race, Mwangi expressed his gratitude to the organisers for their recognition and inclusion.
“The race meant a lot to me because we were recognised. The recognition is something very good and unique. I am very, very grateful. Because we have recognition in this category, more cyclists will definitely show up. Even people with disabilities can show up and plant trees,” said Mwangi.
Paracycling men category winners Gabriel Ambuko and Samuel Mwangi
This year’s challenge attracted five categories: elite, para-cyclists, veterans, junior elite, and the family fun race. Ciarán Fitzpatrick, coach and manager of the INEOS Cycling Academy and Kenyan Riders Cycling Team, is confident that the number of participants will increase next year due to the blend of environmental stewardship and athletic excellence.
“By showcasing the beauty and ecological significance of the Kaptagat Forest, we aim to inspire both participants and spectators to become advocates for its conservation. The challenge also offers talented cyclists a chance to test their mettle on a demanding course, compete, and earn valuable prize money,” he said.
Geoffrey Lagat, the runner-up in the men’s elite race, added, “It is a good race to come for. It is a race for planting trees. We are fighting to have a good climate. Globally, we are preaching that cycling is an important means of transport because of the zero carbon emissions.”
The runner-up in Paracycling men category Samuel Mwangi takes a climb at the finish line during the race.
""The Cycling for Forests commitment from cyclists across Kenya is commendable,"" affirmed Joseph Lagat, chair of the 8th edition of the Kaptagat tree-growing drive. ""They are also advocating for safer roads for non-motorised users like pedestrians and cyclists.
The talent showcased here is impressive and calls for enhancing competitive sport. We want to nurture Trees and top Cycling Talent at the same time. I want to confirm that this will be an annual cycling race, and our job between now and next year is to bring more sponsors on board to boost the prize money.""
In his response, Kenya Cycling Federation Secretary General Charles Mose said, ""More training camps across Kenya will popularise cycling and encourage more Kenyans to take up the sport.""

""In line with the mandate of @Diaspora_KE to promote the welfare of the Kenyan diaspora, the recruitment initiative offers comprehensive support during the transition period through pre-departure sessions,"" said the ministry in a statement.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/uks-labour-sweeps-to-power-as-rishi-sunak-concedes-election-n345255,"UK's Labour sweeps to power as Rishi Sunak concedes election
Keir Starmer will be Britain's next prime
minister with his centre left Labour Party expected to win a huge majority in a
parliamentary election, ending 14 years of often tumultuous Conservative
government by trouncing Rishi Sunak's party.
With many results still to be announced
from Thursday's vote, centre-left Labour has already
won more than 326 of the 650 seats in parliament, with an exit poll suggesting
it would capture about 410.
On a humiliating night for Sunak, the
Conservatives have so far only won 70 and were predicted to suffer the worst
performance in the party's long history with voters punishing them for a cost
of living crisis, failing public services, and a series of scandals.
""Tonight, people here and around the
country have spoken and they're ready for change, to end the politics of
performance, a return to politics as public service,"" Starmer said
after winning his seat in London.
""The change begins right here ... You
have voted. It is now time for us to deliver.""
Sunak conceded defeat and said he had called
Starmer to congratulate him on his victory.
""Today power will change hands in a
peaceful and orderly manner, with goodwill on all sides,"" he said after
regaining his seat. ""There is much to learn and reflect on and I take
responsibility for the loss to the many good hardworking Conservative
candidates ... I am sorry.""
Despite his convincing victory, polls have
suggested there is little enthusiasm for Starmer or his party, and he comes to
power at a time when the country is facing a series of daunting challenges.
Britain's tax burden is set to hit its
highest since just after World War Two, net debt is almost equivalent to annual
economic output, living standards have fallen, and public services are
creaking, especially the much cherished National Health Service which has been
dogged by strikes.
He has already had to scale back some of
Labour's more ambitious plans, such as its flagship green spending pledges,
while he has promised not to raise taxes for ""working people"".
Much of the heavy damage to the Conservative
support was inflicted by the right-wing populist Reform UK party, headed by
Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage, who had campaigned strongly on
curbing immigration.
Starmer has promised to scrap the
Conservative's controversial policy of sending asylum seekers to Rwanda, but will be under pressure himself to
find a solution to stopping tens of thousands of people arriving across the
Channel on small boats.
Within the Conservative party, the
recriminations and debate over its future direction immediately began, with
some saying its failure stemmed from abandoning the centre ground while others
argued Reform had won over voters who felt the party had deserted its roots.
Reform captured four seats, with Farage
himself finally being elected to parliament at his eighth attempt, and won more
votes than the Conservatives across swathes of the country.
""There is a massive gap on the centre
right of British politics and my job is to fill it, and that's exactly what I'm
going to do,"" a triumphant Farage said. ""Believe me, folks, this is
just the first step of something that is going to stun all of you.""
The rise in support for a populist
alternative echoed recent similar results in Europe, where the far right have
been surging.
But, unlike France where Marine Le Pen's
far-right National Rally party made historic gains in an election last Sunday,
overall the British public has plumped for a centre-left party to bring about
change.
Starmer has promised to improve relations
with the European Union to resolve issues created by Brexit, just as far-right
politicians are enjoying success. However, despite opposing Brexit, rejoining
the European Union is not on the table.
He may also have to work with Donald Trump in
the United States if he wins November's presidential election, but he has vowed
to continue London's unequivocal support for Ukraine.
The election victory would represent an
incredible turnaround for Starmer and Labour, which critics and supporters said
was facing an existential crisis just three years ago when it appeared to have
lost its way after its 2019 drubbing.
But a series of Conservative scandals - most
notably revelations of parties in Downing Street during COVID lockdowns -
undermined then prime minister Boris Johnson and its commanding poll leads
evaporated.
Liz Truss' disastrous six-week premiership,
which followed Johnson being forced out at the end of 2022, cemented the
decline, and Sunak was unable to make any dent in Labour's now commanding poll
lead.
Sunak stunned Westminster and many in his own
party by calling the election earlier than he needed to in May with the
Conservatives trailing Labour by some 20 points in opinion polls, and his
campaign then proved a disaster.
""We deserved to lose. The Conservative
Party just appears exhausted and out of ideas,"" Ed Costello, the chairman
of the Grassroots Conservatives organisation, which represents rank-and-file
members, told Reuters.
""But it is not all Rishi Sunak’s fault.
It is Boris Johnson and Liz Truss that have led the party to disaster. Rishi
Sunak is just the fall guy.""

Germany defender Antonio Rudiger on Friday returned to training ahead of Saturday's Euro 2024 last 16 clash with Denmark, having missed earlier sessions with a hamstring strain.
Denmark however will be forced to sweat on the fitness of midfielder Christian Eriksen, who did not take the pitch in the Danes' pre-match training session.
A spokesperson from the Danish FA (DBU) said Eriksen had taken part in a gym workout instead.
Rudiger's potential absence was a threat for Germany, who are already set to do without fellow centre-back Jonathan Tah, who misses the game with a yellow card suspension.
The Real Madrid defender was in high spirits at Friday's session, joking with Jamal Musiala while doing laps of the pitch at the German training base in Herzogenaurach.
Rudiger injured his hamstring towards the end of Germany's 1-1 draw with Switzerland in the final group game but played on and completed the match.
Nico Schlotterbeck, who faced off against Rudiger in the Champions League final with club side Borussia Dortmund in June, will take Tah's place in central defence.

In a ruling on Wednesday, Magistrate BenMark Ekumbi at the Milimani Law Courts further directed the accused to report to the Investigating Officer once a week and to deposit their travel documents.
Magistrate Ekumbi also warned them against interfering with witnesses in the case.
The court noted that there are no compelling reasons to deny bail, as investigations can proceed while they are out. The prosecution's application to detain them for 14 days was deemed lacking in merit.
No charges have been preferred against the suspects, whom the prosecution is investigating for offences related to abuse of office and conspiracy to defraud.
The suspects were arrested following allegations that they fraudulently induced foreign nationals from Dubai and South Africa to secure a tender for constructing two stadiums for the AFCON 2027 games. It is alleged that the complainants were to be defrauded of over Ksh. 5 million as a registration fee.
According to the prosecution, the complainants were led to believe they would meet government officials from the Ministries of Sports, Interior, and Youth Affairs, as well as senators from the Budget and Sports committees, to facilitate the tendering process.
Upon entering the Prime CS office, Swaleh reportedly facilitated a meeting where one of the suspects posed as the chairman of the Government Delivery Unit, promising to expedite the tender process for the foreigners.
Investigations are ongoing, with plans to gather statements and verify company registration details from relevant authorities in the UAE. The prosecution argues that the suspects pose a flight risk and may interfere with the complex investigation, particularly because it involves foreign entities.

The court ordered parties in the case to appear virtually for a brief hearing in the petition pitting the LSK against the State and the Defence Cabinet Secretary.
In documents filed in court, LSK says that no state of emergency under
Article 58 of the Constitution has been declared by President William Ruto in exercising
his constitutional mandate under Article 132 (4) (d) of the Constitution.
“No emergency, disaster, insecurity, unrest
or instability has been officially declared to exist in Kenya, and to be
outside the mandate, scope or capacity of the National Police or any other
authority to warrant the deployment of the KDF to provide support to the
National Police in the manner envisaged in the Impugned Gazette Notice,""
reads the petition.
They say that the Tuesday Gazette notice by
Defence Cabinet Secretary Aden Duale is contrary to the Constitution and poses
a huge threat of violation of the fundamental rights and freedoms of many
Kenyans who may wish to exercise their right to peacefully protest within the
confines of the Constitution and the law.
“Indeed, many Kenyans, especially youth
between the ages of 18 to 35 are outraged by the current state of public
finance management in the country and the government’s proclivity towards
increasing taxes to fund its spending.
“As such, the youth have organised
themselves and hundreds of thousands across the Country have turned up to carry
out peaceful protests calling for the rejection of the Finance Bill 2024 is a
demonstration of their frustration with the Government,” they argue.
It is their argument that the deployment is
illegal and unconstitutional.
“What makes the move illegal and
unconstitutional move clearly unprecedented is that save for the military coup
in the year 1982, no other time in the history of our Republic has there ever
been a carte blanche deployment of the military for purposes of supporting the
National Police during civilian demonstrations,” LSK says.

ahead of their first match.
“The boys are psyched
up and ready for the Uruguay game, the preparations have been well; everything
has been in order. The support has also been good from our fans back at home

match fitness of the players.
“We’ve been preparing
for long before we came to Scotland and also most people have been playing
right from Floodlight to the Championship, Kenya Cup and also the nationwide
league so we are really prepared. We’ve been playing for a long time and we are
ready for the tournament ahead.”
The MMUST RFC back row

history in their fourth appearance in the World U20 trophy tournament.
“I would like to ask
all the Kenyans to continue supporting us, your messages of encouragement are
really nice; we are really glad that you people are backing us up and we will
do our best to bring this (World U20 trophy) back home.”

Bronny James, the 19-year-old son of Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James, was selected 55th overall by the Lakers in Thursday's second round of the NBA Draft, setting up the first father-son combination in NBA history.
It's a dream come true for four-time NBA Most Valuable Player James, who said for years he dreamed of playing alongside his son.
""In the history of the NBA, there has never been a father and a son that have shared an NBA basketball court,"" Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka said. ""That feels like something that could be magical.""
LeBron, a 39-year-old Lakers playmaker and four-time NBA champion, will be busy on the US team at the Paris Olympics next month while son Bronny is set to join the Lakers in NBA Summer League games in Las Vegas.
LeBron James posted photos on Instagram with the one-word caption ""LEGACY!!!!!!"" and images of himself with Bronny as a child, of both of them dunking and another with father and son side-by-side in Lakers jerseys.
Bronny James, a guard for the University of Southern California, averaged 4.8 points, 2.8 rebounds and 2.1 assists for the Trojans last season after a stellar high school career and also impressed scouts at an NBA combine.
At a practice session last July, USC freshman James collapsed after suffering cardiac arrest caused by a congenital heart defect.
The teenager was released from the hospital a few days later and doctors approved him playing both in US college basketball and, last month, in the NBA.
""Congratulations to Bronny James on being drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers!"" Lakers legend Magic Johnson said. ""This is a historic moment... Watching Bronny suit up for the @Lakers during Summer League in Vegas will be must-see TV!""
The younger James is seen as a top defensive prospect with elite athletic skills and strong instincts for the game but might need time to develop fully as an NBA player.
""We're excited to see this story unfold,"" said Pelinka, who said new Lakers coach JJ Redick is already planning how to make Bronny better.
""It's an honor for us to add him to our program,"" Pelinka said. ""Coach Redick is already excited about putting a development plan around him to increase his basketball skills and turn him into a player we think can impact and help this franchise.""
LeBron James has until Saturday to opt into the final year of his Lakers contract or become a free agent, which could set up a new Lakers deal. The status gave him options should Bronny have ended up elsewhere in the NBA.
""We know and have to respect that LeBron has a decision about his opt out and I'm sure he and his family will decide what they are going to do there,"" Pelinka said.
""If it worked out that he was on our team next season, history could be made -- and NBA history should be made in a Lakers uniform.""
The Lakers owned the fourth-to-last NBA Draft selection and there was concern other clubs might use a higher pick on James, to see if they could swing a trade deal with the Lakers for James or the pick.
ESPN reported agent Rich Paul warned clubs against picking Bronny, saying he would go to Australia before dealing with some teams.
The Phoenix Suns, who didn't own a second-round pick due to a free agency tampering violation, were the only team other than the Lakers to have a workout with Bronny James ahead of the draft.
Pelinka said character and work ethic were more important factors than ancestry for the Lakers.
""Bronny is first and foremost a person of high character and second he's a young man that works incredibly hard and those are the qualities we look for in drafting players and adding to our developmental core of the Lakers,"" Pelinka said.
""In terms of his work ethic, I think we've all seen that lived out too. He's not a person that has ever taken short cuts, or expected or been entitled about basketball opportunities. He has worked for everything he has gotten, including being selected today at 55.""

The International Organization for Migration Kenya (IOM), has partnered with Kenya Airways (KQ) to enhance efforts against human trafficking.
The partnership will see Kenya Airways receive training and expertise from United Nation’s migration arm IOM, to facilitate the carrier identify and prevent human trafficking and facilitate legal migration pathways.
While victims of human trafficking largely remain unaccounted for due to the clandestine nature of the crime, the government recorded 90 cases of human trafficking in 2022.
“In Africa we have a huge youth population, we have a youth bulge. Either unemployed or under employed. And on the other hand, the destination countries they have aging population, labour shortages. So, if we have a win-win where people can move in a safe and regulated way then we shall have cracked it,” said Chief of Mission, IOM Kenya Dimanche Sharon.
On his part, Kenya Airways CEO Allan Kilavuka stressed the importance of the airline to join the fight against human trafficking because it plays a pivotal role in global transportation.
""For us as Kenya airways, we move 5 million people every year, and it is important for us to ensure that this people are moved in a safe, secure and dignified manner,"" he said.
""There are many instances where we have undocumented immigrants and people who move without dignity. So we have signed a memorandum to work collaboratively to make sure that people ae moving in a safe secure and dignified manner.""

Residents of Kathangachini area in Tharaka Nithi county have breathed a sigh of relief following the connection of power in the area.
The electrification is part of a project including three constituencies: Maara, Chuka, and Tharaka that aims to supply power to schools, hospitals, churches, and government offices.
Residents of Kathangachini, located in the arid lower part of Tharaka, had for a long time complained about the lack of electricity, curbing development and making provision of essential services difficult.
Area MP, Gitonga Murugara, lauded the project by the Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Corporation (REREC). ""We aim to ensure more coverage so that residents have access to reliable power,"" he said.
Beatrice Njuguna, REREC general manager, said, ""Electricity is a catalyst for development. It will not only improve the living standards but also stimulate economic activities, create jobs, and enhance educational and healthcare services. We are committed to ensuring that no part of this region remains in darkness.""

Stephen Mokogi Nyarenchi appeared before Principal Magistrate Ben Mark Ekhubi on Monday, where he denied both charges.
He was released on a cash bail of Ksh.2,000.
Protesters broke into parliament last Tuesday after overpowering police officers, and in multiple videos, they ransacked the August House, ate food in the cafeteria, and even stole a serjeant-at-arms jacket.
Speculation abounded last week after a video showed protesters brandishing what appeared to be the mace, but Speaker Wetangula denied losing his symbol authority, telling the House on Wednesday that what had been stolen was a dummy mace used for decorative purposes.
""Reports that the House mace had been carted away by the demonstrators are false; what was taken away was a dummy Mace on display."" Wetangula told the House.
""I want to assure members of the House that the mace is always highly secured,”
The ceremonial mace is an elaborately adorned staff made of metal, wood, or other materials.
It is carried by a designated Mace-bearer or placed in front of sovereigns and high officials during civic ceremonies or revered gatherings to symbolise authority.
The one in Parliament features the Kenyan coat of arms and is made of gold, ivory, and gold coating.

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/we-didnt-underestimate-georgia-says-portugal-coach-martinez-n344768,"We didn't underestimate Georgia, says Portugal coach Martinez

Portugal coach Roberto Martinez insisted his side had not underestimated Georgia but admitted they were deservedly beaten as they went down 2-0 in their final Euro 2024 group game on Wednesday.
Khvicha Kvaratskhelia's early goal and a second-half penalty by Georges Mikautadze gave Georgia a stunning victory in Gelsenkirchen that saw them qualify for the last 16 in their first ever appearance at the competition.
However, Portugal had already qualified for the next round as Group F winners and Martinez made eight changes to his starting line-up as a result.
""We didn't underestimate Goergia but it is true that they were playing the biggest game in their history,"" Martinez said after Portugal suffered their first competitive defeat since the 2022 World Cup.
""We were playing the last game when we were already top of our group and it was difficult for us to match their intensity.""
He added: ""We conceded an early goal which is what Georgia wanted and needed.
""Then after that we didn't have the clarity, or a good enough final ball, to get in on goal, and their goalkeeper played very well.
""We couldn't get a goal which gave Georgia extra strength and belief, and they deserved the victory.""
Only captain Cristiano Ronaldo, Joao Palhinha and goalkeeper Diogo Costa kept their places in Portugal's team following the 3-0 win over Turkey which had clinched their last-16 spot with a game to spare.
Martinez also substituted Ronaldo midway through the second half, and he admitted he made so many changes with an eye on their upcoming last-16 tie, on Monday in Frankfurt.
""The objective was to have the players prepared as best as possible for the last 16.
""Without doubt that contributed to the final result, but we kept trying to get a goal back,"" he said, while complaining that Georgia's penalty was soft and his team should have had one of their own.
""At times I think we didn't have luck. The VAR was very inconsistent because in the 27th minute there was an even more clear penalty on Cristiano Ronaldo than the one given against Antonio Silva.
""The players individually showed what they can do, but for Georgia it was a historic game and we didn't match the levels of intensity required.""
Portugal now know their last-16 opponents will be Slovenia, to whom they lost 2-0 in a friendly in March.
Martinez said there was no prospect his side would take them lightly.
""I think the important thing is to remember there are no easy games,"" he said.
""This is not a friendly. We need to better prepared from a psychological point of view.”

Al-Mahfouz Bin Bayyah from Hiroshima: Artificial intelligence is the pathway to global peace
This came in his speech at the closing session of the historic multi-religious conference held on July 9 and 10 in the Japanese city of Hiroshima under the title ""The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence in the Service of Peace: The World’s Religions Commit to the Rome Call,” in the presence and participation of His Excellency Mr. Taro Kono, Japanese Minister of Digital Transformation, Mr. Brad Smith, President of Microsoft Corporation, His Eminence Yoshiharu Tomatsu, President of Religions for Peace - Japan, His Eminence Bishop Buckleya, President of the Pontifical Academy for Life, and several figures representing the religions of the East.
His Excellency Al-Mahfouz Bin Bayyah added that the Forum’s participation in this important historical event is an embodiment of the vision of the United Arab Emirates, which has made civilizational partnership its approach, and human being and his happiness its goal, and that the UAE is resolved with confidence to assume its pioneering role in shaping the future of humanity.
Bin Bayyah also stated that the UAE’s leadership in the field of artificial intelligence, which has today become the subject of international recognition and acclaim, stems not only from its unprecedented level of investment in these new technologies, the establishment of the necessary infrastructure, and the development of regulating laws and legislation, but also stems from integrating this vision into the global peace strategy framework, by making sure to frame this development with the principles of human values that ensure that science is focused on making peace, and that technologies aim to help humans. In this context, His Excellency the Secretary-General quoted His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE President, at the G20 Rome Summit, when His Highness pointed out that ""Handling emerging technologies in a responsible and ethical way makes them a source of sustainable development, security and prosperity for all.""
Sheikh Mahfouz bin Bayyah reiterated the Abu Dhabi Peace Forum’s commitment to the Rome Charter for AI Ethics, recalling that the Forum was the first representative institution of Islam and the Arab world to engage in this joint humanitarian effort that aims to establish legislative frameworks guided by values and visions, to be a lighthouse and guide for AI developers, and to help them respond to the requirements of ethics, without preventing them from achieving creativity and innovation.
The Secretary-General also referred to the efforts made by the Religion and Civil Society Commission on Artificial Intelligence, which he chairs, in the United Kingdom and the path of partnerships and cooperation it has undertaken since its establishment in December last year.
During his talk about the centrality of the vision of peace, Bin Bayyah stressed that there is no alternative to peace except annihilation, calling for cooperation to survive no matter how widespread the wars are and how intense the conflicts become, explaining that the peace that the UAE seeks in the world, and within which the forum navigates, is the emergence of a human being with a new mentality, a new vision towards the world, based on the values of peace, virtue and mercy, so that he can rebuild himself and his relationships with his own people and with people from other nations.

Wamumbi told Inooro TV that their disagreement had nothing to do with the Gachagua-led war on illicit liquor.
He said he disagreed with Gachagua after the latter asked them to abandon the current leadership and regroup ahead of the 2027 general election.
The legislator stated that despite having cordial relations with the second-in-command in recent years, his advice was rejected at a meeting at Gachagua's home.
He told Inooro TV that he met Gachagua on May 25, 2024, in a meeting that started around 7.30 a.m. and ended at 3 p.m.
""I was the only person he met that day; we talked for hours, and I tried to tell him that his advisers were misleading him, just as they had misled another president,"" the MP explained.
""I told him that he had told the Gikuyu people that he never slept and was always watching out for them, but he was now leading them down the wrong path.""
The MP accused Gachagua of being a turncoat and reneging on his agreement with Ruto ahead of the 2022 general elections.
He stated that it was the DP who first introduced him to President Ruto prior to the 2022 elections, and that he (Gachagua) had a gentleman's agreement with the President on how positions would be shared.
""Gachagua told me he was not going to have a written agreement with President Ruto because he trusted him,"" the MP said.
""He told us that after we won the election,he would then go to the President with a list of seats that would benefit the Central Kenya people,""
According to the MP, after the polls, Gachagua went to President Ruto with a list of demands, which resulted in key seats in Kenya's power corridor.
""The deputy president was seeking nine key seats that he believed would benefit the Central Kenyan people,"" MP Wamumbi stated.
According to the legislator, Gachagua's election haul included positions in Agriculture (Agriculture CS), Money (CS Njuguna Ndungu), Security (CS Kithure Kindiki), Water (Zachariah Njeru), Lands (Alice Wahome), Public Service (Moses Kuria), Secretary to Cabinet, Central Bank Governor (Kamau Thugge), and Attorney General (Justin Muturi).
The MP claims he pleaded with DP Gachagua that, rather than jumping ship to form a 2027 political vehicle, it was preferable to serve under President Ruto and take advantage of the 10 out of 26 cabinet positions to benefit the Mt. Kenya region.
""I begged him that we stay in government since we already have enought seats we should work using what we have,"" he added.
""He has helped me a lot in my life, but that does not mean I do not have opinions on our country's leadership.""

Despite qualifying for the final of the Kenya National
Basketball Women's Premier League with a 3-2 win over Zetech Sparks on Sunday
at the Nyayo Gymnasium, Equity Hawks head coach Benson Oluoch said they had a
bad start which they rectified in the second half.
The bankers hammered the students 61-46 in Game Five of the
five-game series.
“It was all about trying to understand what your opponents have,
and the guys on the floor maybe they didn't warm up well, but as the game
progressed we came back strongly,” stated Oluoch.
“We were down ten points and the girls showed a lot of
resilience to go up by another ten points,” he added.
On his part, Zetech Sparks head coach Maurice Obilo blamed
fatigue due to lack of key players as one of the reasons they failed to qualify
for the final.
“Since I had only eight players, I think fatigue caused all of
us a lot going into the third quarter and I think that's why we scrambled along
the way. Otherwise we are good and I am proud of them and very happy that they
are stepping up,” Obilo noted.
“They still have another season to play we shall just regroup,
come back and work for next season.”
At the same time, Obilo said failure to represent the country in
FIBA Zone Five Championship affected the team at the beginning of the season,
but stated why they could not represent Kenya despite qualifying last season.
“It was about communication, we didn't communicate at the right
time that's why we didn't get the finance, but at the same time, it deflected
them at the beginning of the season. This time round they knew if they
qualify they would have gone to the championship but that is water under the
bridge right now,” he stated.
“We focus on the upcoming season, adjust one or two things and
push ourselves and see if we can do better next season. We are already eight,
we are looking forward to add at least four more players and we are good to go,
everybody that has played this series will be there next season,” Obilo added.
Equity will face defending champions Kenya Ports Authority (KPA)
in the final starting next weekend. The Dockers knocked out Strathmore
Swords with a 3-0 sweep in the other semi-final playoff.
In men's premier league, defending champions KPA will meet
unbeaten side Nairobi City Thunder, after both sides qualified with a 3-0 win
against Strathmore Blades and Equity Dumas respectively in the semis.
KPA will be hosting Thunder for Game One and Two in Mombasa this
coming weekend in the five-game series final.

Published on: July 10, 2024 07:41 (EAT)

Lionel Messi was on target as world champions Argentina turned on the style to beat Canada 2-0 on Tuesday and reach the Copa America final where they will look for a third straight major title.
The defending Copa champions will face the winners of Wednesday's semi-final between Uruguay and Colombia in what will be a highly anticipated final in Miami on Sunday.
The 15-times Copa champions produced their best display of the tournament in front of a capacity crowd at the 82,500 MetLife Stadium and as in their 2022 World Cup triumph they look to be peaking at the perfect moment.
""The truth is that it's crazy what this group has done, what the Argentina national team has been doing,"" Messi told TyC Sports after his first goal of the tournament.
""It's not easy for us to be in a final again, for us to compete again to be champions. I'm living it like I lived it in the last Copa America, in the last World Cup...These are the last battles and I'm enjoying them to the maximum,"" said the 37-year-old.
Canada, who surprised many by reaching the last four in their first Copa America appearance, can take great credit for their run in the tournament but Messi and company were simply a step too far.
""I think the tournament caught up with us a little bit,"" said Canada's American coach Marsch, who said he noticed that his players looked tired midway through the first half.
""Eventually the physicality and fatigue can catch up with you and that was a big part of what happened with us tonight,"" he added.
Marsch's side had progressed by hitting teams with high-energy football straight out of the gate but after an early opening for left-winger Jacob Shaffelburg, who fired wide after cutting in from the flank, the South Americans took control and never gave it up.
Angel Di Maria, the veteran wide-man playing in his final tournament for his country, was seeing plenty of the ball down the right and he offered an early warning of his threat when he picked out Messi with a ball inside which the forward flashed just wife of the post.
But it was Rodrigo De Paul who was to create the breakthrough in the 22nd minute, picking the ball up on the half-way line, taking a quick glance up and then lofting the ball over the top to Julian Alvarez.
The Manchester City forward, recalled to the starting line-up ahead of Lautaro Martinez, delivered a deft first touch that took him away from Moises Bombito and gave him just enough room to drive the ball home.
The classy triangle of Di Maria, Messi and De Paul, was a constant source of danger for Canada's back line and the former threatened a second with a chip from the right which floated over the bar.
The assuredness of Argentina's build-up play reflects the confidence of coach Lionel Scaloni's team, a well-drilled unit but one that never allows their organisational solidity dominate over their creativity.
Two minutes before the break, former Real Madrid winger Di Maria provided a slide-rule pass to Messi, who worked himself space for a shot on his right-foot, but he was narrowly wide of Max Crepeau's right-hand post.
Canada's American coach Marsch had plenty of work to do at the interval if he was to find a way of getting his team back on level terms and any strategy went out of the window when the world champions doubled their lead, just six minutes after the restart.
The excellent De Paul pulled the ball back from the byline to Enzo Fernandez and his side-foot shot was directed home by Messi in front of goal.
For a moment Canada had hope that Messi may have been offside but the VAR review showed that defender Derek Cornelius had played him onside.
The two-goal cushion established, Argentina were content to sit back and preserve their energy and invite the Canadians to take them on.
It was not until the final minutes though that Canada were able to trouble Emiliano Martinez with substitute Tani Oluwaseyi forcing the keeper into action after some sloppy defending.
But it was a comfortable victory for Scaloni's men and one which leaves them one win away from a record 16th Copa America triumph.

Unions representing workers at Paris' airports said Monday they had called for a strike the week before the Paris Olympics over a dispute about bonuses for staff.
The CGT, CFDT, FO and UNSA unions called the strike on July 17 -- nine days before the start of the Paris Games -- to demand that all staff receive an Olympics bonus, denouncing ""unilateral decisions from the chief executive to pay a bonus to only some personnel.""
Unions at state-controlled Groupe ADP, which runs Paris' main airports Charles de Gaulle and Orly, had previously called for a strike on May 19, which did not cause major disruption.
The two airports will be the main gateway into France for foreign visitors to the Olympics, with up to 350,000 people a day expected to transit there during the Games, as well as most athletes and their equipment.
Thousands of athletes are expected to begin arriving from July 18, when the athletes' village opens, with a new temporary over-sized baggage terminal at Charles de Gaulle set to handle equipment such as kayaks, bikes or polevaulting poles.
Unions representing workers across the public sector in France have demanded extra pay or support for having to work over the July 26-August 11 Paris Games, which fall during the traditional summer holiday in France.
Police, air traffic controllers, rubbish collectors, central government employees, metro and train drivers as well as firefighters have all made demands, with their employers under pressure to yield to avoid disruption.
Workers at the national mint, which is producing the medals, have also been on strike, but management says that production has not been affected.

""The Individuals whose images/photos appear below are wanted by the police for their unlawful activities during the anti-finance bill demonstrations. We therefore advise them to report to the nearest police station for further police action,"" the DCI stated.
The public has also been urged to volunteer information on the whereabouts of the individuals and have been asked to anonymously channel the details to the hotline number 0800722203 or call 999,911 or 112.
This comes after the DCI had issued a stern warning to individuals who had planned to use the nationwide anti-government demonstrations as a way to carry out their heinous activities.
Peaceful protests which were happening all over the country were later turned into violence by goons. The individuals infiltrated the Nairobi CBD and various parts of the country in an attempt to vandalise and steal from various businesses.
The Gen Z`s who initially spearheaded these protests made a mark of peace with both the police and businesses, however, goons changed this narrative through looting of various shops and throwing stones at police.
Some of the protestors noted a change in the atmosphere stating that unlike previous protests the most recent were infiltrated by delinquents who stole people’s phones and destroyed businesses.

The Paris Olympic village, which was designed without air conditioning to reduce carbon emissions, will be fitted with 2,500 temporary cooling units when athletes arrive later this month, organisers said on Tuesday.
The complex in a northern suburb of Paris was built as a showcase of environmentally friendly technology and has a geothermal cooling system that uses cool water pumped from deep beneath the ground.
But the lack of air-conditioning has long worried some national Olympic teams, whose athletes are concerned about missing sleep, particularly given the summer heat waves suffered by Paris in recent years.
Organisers devised a compromise that enabled teams to order portable air-conditioning units at their own expense, which can be installed for the duration of the July 26-August 11 Olympics.
""The aim was to provide a very specific solution for athletes who are facing the match or competition of their lives.. and who might have requirements for their comfort and recovery which are higher than in a normal summer,"" the deputy director of the village, Augustin Tran Van Chau, said Tuesday.
""Around 2,500 ACs have been ordered,"" he told journalists during a visit to the village for the media.
The accommodation complex comprises 7,000 rooms in total, with the geothermal cooling system guaranteeing temperatures inside at least 6 degrees Celsius (11 Fahrenheit) below those outside.
The roughly 40 low-rise towers will host around 10,000 Olympians, and then 5,000 Paralympians during the Paralympic Games from August 28-September 8.
The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, who heads the Olympics infrastructure group Solideo, had ruled out using portable air-conditioners in the village last year.
""I have a lot of respect for the comfort of athletes, but I think a lot more about the survival of humanity,"" she told French radio France Info in February 2023.
The influential US Olympic team is known to have pushed for the provision of air-conditioning.
""We raised a lot of issues early on and they (organisers) have met those needs, like air conditioning for athletes in the village,"" Rocky Harris, chief of athlete services for the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC), told AFP in February.
""Those things are important because of sleep and health and wellness for the athletes.""
The Paris Games is aiming to reduce its total carbon emissions to half the level of previous editions in London in 2012 and Rio de Janeiro in 2016.
As well as the ""eco-friendly"" village that includes low-carbon building materials, organisers are mostly relying on temporary stadiums or renovated old ones, instead of building new venues.
Only two new permanent venues will be used during the Games.
Meat products have also been reduced on menus at the village and at sports venues, with the temporary stadium hosting the skateboarding and BMXing at Place de la Concorde set to be 100-percent vegetarian.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/finance-bill-2024-why-parliament-will-not-be-recalled-but-the-bill-is-dead-n344831,"Finance Bill 2024: Why Parliament will not be recalled but the Bill is dead
National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetangula on Thursday referred President William Ruto's Memorandum of Referral, in regards to the Finance Bill 2024/25, to Parliament's Departmental Committee on Finance and Planning, officially kick-starting the process to have the controversial bill withdrawn as per the President's recommendations.
With Parliament currently on recess until Tuesday, July 23, 2024, questions have been raised concerning how the House will proceed in regards to the retraction of the aforementioned bill.
Wetangula has since come out to clarify that the House will not immediately be reconvened to discuss President Ruto's memorandum further explaining the basic applicable procedures and implications of the Rejection of the Finance Bill, 2024 on the fiscal year 2024/25.
Below are a few key things you should take note of:
What is the procedure for consideration of the President’s Memorandum
to a Bill?
Article 115 of the Constitution empowers the President to refer back a Bill to Parliament for reconsideration, noting any reservations that the President may have concerning the Bill.
Thereafter Parliament is required to consider the reservations in the manner provided for under Article 115 of the Constitution.
What has the President’s Memorandum recommended to the National
Assembly in respect of the Finance Bill, 2024?
The President’s Memorandum has referred the Finance Bill, 2024, back to the House for reconsideration with reservations recommending the deletion of all sixty-nine (69) clauses of the bill.
What is the effect of the President’s Memorandum on the Bill and can the
Bill be revived?
The President’s Memorandum constitutes a rejection of the bill in its entirety. The effect is that the entire Bill will be lost upon approval of the President’s reservations and recommendations by the National Assembly.
Any Member intending to negate the President’s reservations/veto or revive any of the sixty-nine (69) Clauses of the Bill is required to marshal the votes of at least two-thirds of the Members of the National Assembly, being 233 Members. This is in keeping with the provisions of Article 115(4)(a) of the Constitution.
Upon receipt of the President’s Memorandum, the Speaker of the National Assembly is required to refer the Memorandum to the Departmental Committee on Finance and National Planning.
The Memorandum has since been referred by the Speaker to the Committee for consideration and reporting to the National Assembly when it next sits.
In the event the Committee fails to report to the House at its next sitting, the House shall proceed and consider the Memorandum at Committee of the Whole House upon resumption from recess.
What should guide the Committee and the House in considering the
President’s Memorandum?
The President’s Memorandum recommending deletion of all clauses of the Bill, notes that it is informed by the need to reflect the voice of the people of Kenya who have rejected the bill in its entirety. The Committee and the House shall take this justification into account in their deliberations.
What is the link between the Budget, the Finance Bill and the
Appropriation Bill?
The Budget for any financial year comprises Estimates of Expenditure for the national government. The approved Estimates of Expenditure are translated into an Appropriation Bill for consideration and passage by the National Assembly.
Documents supporting the Budget contain also projections of revenue, loans, and grants required to finance the Budget for a Financial Year.
The projections of revenue are derived from existing tax measures and proposed revenue-raising measures through new or additional taxation.
Any new or additional taxation measures and any variation to existing tax measures are introduced through a Finance Bill.
The Finance Bill is a piece of legislation that largely consolidates the various proposed taxation measures intended to raise additional revenue to support the budget.
It may lead to an increase or reduction of taxes. The various revenue-raising measures in a Finance Bill are costed and therefore constitute part of the Estimates of Revenue.
Will the National Assembly be recalled to consider the President’s
Memorandum?
Standing Order 42(3) of the National Assembly Standing Orders requires the Speaker to transmit to every Member any Message received from the President at a time when the House is not in session and to report the Message to the House on the day it next sits.
Additionally, the National Assembly altered its Calendar and proceeded for a short recess on Wednesday, June 26, 2024.
The House is scheduled to resume its regular sittings on Tuesday, July 23, 2024. The Departmental Committee on Finance and National Planning shall be required to report to the House on the President’s Memorandum on this day.
Emphatically, No!
Having been referred back to the National Assembly for reconsideration on account of the President’s reservations, the Finance Bill, 2024 cannot become law through mere lapse of time.
What are the implications of the Rejection and Loss of the entire
Finance Bill, 2024?
The House is guided that the rejection and loss of the entire Finance Bill, 2024 shall occasion a financing gap of approximately Ksh.300 billion between the expenditure approved by the National Assembly through the Appropriation Bill, 2024 and the projected revenues that may be raised from the existing tax measures.
The next Financial Year shall commence in the next four days, being 1st July 2024. The instrument which authorizes the withdrawal of monies from the Consolidated Fund for utilization by the national government is the Appropriation Bill, which is distinct from the Finance Bill.
Notably, the House has already passed the Appropriation Bill, 2024. The House is guided that the financing gap may be bridged by the reduction of approved expenditure.
This may be achieved by enacting a Supplementary Appropriation Bill in accordance with the applicable procedure.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/history-at-kicc-as-president-ruto-signs-a-bill-outside-state-house-for-the-first-time-n345517,"President Ruto signs a Bill outside State House for the first time
The Kenyatta International Convention Centre (KICC) played a pivotal role as a neutral host for the signing of the bill to reconstitute the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC).
This event was attended by key political figures including President Ruto, Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua, former Prime Minister Raila Odinga, and former Vice President Kalonzo Musyoka, among others, symbolizing a moment of unity and reconciliation for the nation.
The choice of KICC as the venue follows recent challenges, such as public protests in Nairobi's central business district and other parts of the country triggered by the rejection of the Finance Bill 2024, which the President has withdrawn. However, a major underlying issue was the demand for a properly constituted electoral body.
KICC Chief Executive Officer James Mwaura welcomed the decision to sign the bill at KICC, emphasizing the significance of the iconic Centre, which has hosted several other landmark milestones and key national occasions.
“I am glad that KICC is making history once again by hosting this significant event that will bring calm to the country,” said Mwaura, underscoring the safety and readiness of the Centre to host upcoming events.
Former Vice President Kalonzo Musyoka highlighted the importance of holding the event at KICC, emphasizing its neutrality and symbolic value as a national asset representing unity.
Among the significant events hosted at Africa’s premier Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions (MICE) hotspot are the 59th African Development Bank Group Annual Meetings in May, attended by over ten African presidents. However, ongoing protests led to the postponement of major events, including the 8th African Anti-Corruption Dialogue originally scheduled for July 9, 2024. The African Union Advisory Board against Corruption has committed to rescheduling this event and will hold a virtual commemoration of African Anti-Corruption Day on July 11, 2024.
KICC's historical significance dates back to its inauguration by Kenya's first president, Jomo Kenyatta, in 1973. It has hosted numerous landmark events and remains an iconic symbol of Kenya's self-rule and ambition.

This follows a petition filed by Saitabao Ole Kanchory where Justice Mugure Thande also prohibited the use of brute force or any form of violence against protestors.
""I find the petitioner has demonstrated that the petition is arguable and not frivolous. Second, she has demonstrated that it is in the public interest that the orders sought are granted,"" ruled Justice Thande.
Similarly, the court has issued an order stopping the police from committing any extrajudicial killings, arrests, abductions, detentions, harassment, intimidation, torture, or cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment of persons protesting against the Finance Bill.
In the petition, Kanchory argues that the police have resorted to arbitrary arrests and illegal abductions of protesters, as well as intimidation and harassment.
According to him, the police have been violating their right to liberty and their freedom from torture.
""The 1st and 2nd Respondents have deployed the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) to harass and intimidate perceived leaders of the Gen Z,"" reads court documents.
He further claims that Gen Z, being youth, are members of a vulnerable group requiring special protection under Articles 20 and 21 of the Constitution.

Published on: June 30, 2024 07:16 (EAT)

Argentina shrugged off the injury absence of Lionel Messi to maintain their perfect start at the Copa America on Saturday with a 2-0 victory over Peru in Miami.
Lautaro Martinez scored twice at the Hard Rock Stadium to seal a win that ensured Argentina advance to the quarter-finals as Group A winners.
With Messi sidelined after complaining of a sore right hamstring, and coach Lionel Scaloni serving a one-game suspension, Argentina made nine changes to their starting XI at the Hard Rock Stadium.
But despite the makeshift-looking line-up, Argentina were always in control against a disappointing Peru side who managed just one shot on goal during a one-sided encounter.
Martinez's first goal came just after half-time. A sublime through ball from Angel Di Maria released the Inter Milan forward, who calmly lifted a deft finish over advancing Peru goalkeeper Pedro Gallese.
Argentina had a chance to double their lead in the 72nd minute after Jesus Castillo handled in the area to concede a penalty.
But Leandro Paredes crashed his ensuing spot-kick against the woodwork to leave the score at 1-0.
Martinez then grabbed a second in the 86th minute, latching on to a long pass forward before finishing past Gallese.
Replays indicated Martinez appeared to shove defender Aldo Corzo in the build-up but referee Cesar Ramos waved Peru's protest and the goal stood.
""It was tough in the first half because they were defending deep, but the first goal opened up the game,"" Martinez said afterwards. ""There's a lot more to come from us.""
Martinez has now scored in four consecutive appearances for Argentina and is relishing his hot streak.
""Every time I put on this shirt, every training session, every meal, every team talk, I enjoy it,"" Martinez said.
Argentina will now face the runner-up from Group B in the quarter-finals in Houston next Thursday, most likely either Ecuador or Mexico.
In Saturday's other Group A game, Canada held 2015 and 2016 Copa America champions Chile to a 0-0 draw in Orlando, which was enough to see the Canadians into the last eight.
Chile needed a victory to leapfrog the Canadians into the knockout rounds but were left with a mountain to climb early in the game when Gabriel Suazo was dismissed for a second yellow card after only 27 minutes.
""It took a lot of hard work - it's our first time in this competition and it's not easy,"" Canada captain Alphonso Davies said about his team's advance to the last eight.
""There's a lot of good teams in this competition and a lot of good players. But we stuck to our plan and we played well. We showed a lot of fight. We had to show our teeth at times, but overall we did well.""
Canada will play the winners of Group B in the quarter-finals.

According to reports, the two who were part of the protesters in Nairobi were shot by the police and killed while participating in the riots.
HAKI Africa Executive Director Hussein Khalid while addressing the press outside Kenyatta National Hospital on Tuesday confirmed that one person died on the spot from a headshot injury while the other succumbed later before he could access medical care.
“The doctors have told us that they received two dead who arrived when already dead; one was shot in the head while the other was already dead, I don’t know where he was injured. So far they have treated 125 people, most of them soft tissue injuries while others were injured in different places,” he said.
Khalid condemned the use of police brutality in what he said was a peaceful protest saying that the killings organization would take action against the extra-judicial to ensure victims got justice.
“We are very saddened and we want to inform the state that Kenya has moved many years from those dark days and we are not in a police state. The police should not use excessive force on peaceful youthful protesters,” he stated.
""We will work with the necessary authorities to make sure that those who have been killed or injured get justice. We cannot allow any use of excessive force like this.""
He noted that out of the 125 people injured, most of them were suffering from gunshot injuries.
“The doctors could not count those suffering from gunshot wounds, but said that a good number of the 125 people had been shot,"" said Khalid.
The Haki boss at the same time urged the government to heed the calls by Kenyans to reject the Bill instead of trying to force it on the citizens.
""The message is very clear; reject the finance bill. Why are we being forced to accept this. You cannot force this Bill on Kenyans’ throats. Why is the message not getting through to these people? 204 people against 54 million people. You can't say you want to dialogue then you are killing people,""

https://www.citizen.digital/news/how-burkina-fasos-junta-is-conscripting-critics-to-fight-islamist-rebels-n345068,"How Burkina Faso's junta is conscripting critics to fight Islamist rebels
Arouna Loure, a vocal critic of Burkina Faso's ruling military junta, received a conscription order on Sept. 7 last year requesting that the anaesthesiologist start a month of military service four days later.
The order, seen by Reuters, did not specify a date or location for the doctor to report for duty.
Days later, on Sept. 13, two armed men intercepted Loure between operating theatres at a hospital in the capital Ouagadougou, forced him into a 4x4, and drove to a military camp near the northern city of Kaya, he told Reuters.
Loure, 38, had denounced the violence linked to Burkina's almost decade-long fight against Islamist insurgents in the West African country.
His abduction made headlines in local media, adding to a flurry of articles and civil society statements over the past 15 months on the forced disappearance of dozens of activists, journalists, rights defenders, military officials and other critics of Burkina Faso's military government.
Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch (HRW) have accused Burkina's junta of kidnapping and conscripting some of its critics, citing victims and civil society groups.
Reuters could not find any public response by authorities to the reports and the junta did not reply to requests for comment for this story.
Loure, who was released after three months of forced military service, said he was conscripted at the same time as eight other government critics and activists at the Kaya camp.
""They want to silence us,"" he told Reuters during a telephone interview in March. ""These conscriptions are arbitrary and punitive.""
Reuters directly verified 19 abductions since March 2023 through interviews with civil society groups, relatives, colleagues and released victims. It identified four more using public statements from family members, civil society groups and political parties.
Most of those abductees remain unaccounted for.
Four victims who spoke to Reuters after their release said they were snatched from their workplace or the street by armed police or military officials.
Their kidnappers were either wearing Burkina Faso army uniforms or were men in civilian clothing who verbally identified themselves as police or military, they said.
The four victims described a violent system of intimidation that involved forced military service and torture.
Junta spokesman Jean-Emmanuel Ouedraogo, Interior Minister Emile Zerbo, State Minister Bassolma Bazie and army spokesman Isidore Noël did not respond to several requests for comment on the testimonies.
At the start of June, the national order of doctors in Burkina Faso issued a statement saying Loure had gone missing again. Two civil society sources confirmed the information. He has not reappeared since.
The abductions are part of junta leader Ibrahim Traore's efforts to silence critics since he seized power in a September 2022 coup - the second that year - with a promise to restore security, three analysts say.
""The regime's authoritarian drift is clear,"" said Mathieu Pellerin, a Sahel expert for the International Crisis Group. He said the government was hardening its stance towards internal critics as its position became more ""fragile"".
""It's the flip-side of its failure to restore security,"" he said.
Burkina Faso's army has only made incremental gains despite spending millions of dollars on the war and boosting its ranks with thousands of volunteer auxiliaries known as VDPs, three analysts and humanitarian groups say.
Frustrations about authorities' failure to shield civilians from the insurgency stoked the first military coup that ousted President Roch Kabore in January 2022, and then the toppling of Traore's predecessor eight months later.
In Burkina, more than 6,500 civilians have been killed since the start of 2020, according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED), a global source of data on political violence. More than half died under the current government.
Both sides are accused of attacking villages suspected of collaborating with the enemy and executing civilians, including women and children. Authorities have denied reports of soldiers killing civilians.
Earlier this year, the junta suspended several foreign media outlets for covering a HRW report accusing the army of extrajudicial killings.
The conscription of junta critics began in March 2023 with Boukare Ouedraogo, the visually-impaired president of a civil society group in Kaya.
Ouedraogo, 32, had spoken at a press conference that month about feeling let down by Traore. He denounced insecurity and lack of drinking water since insurgents destroyed a water tower.
Five days later, Traore visited Kaya, summoned Ouedraogo and ordered his arrest, said Moussa Sawadogo, a colleague who attended the meeting.
After Ouedraogo's arrest, Traore said during a speech that he had ordered the conscription of a citizen for disclosing sensitive information that triggered a jihadist attack - without naming anyone.
He said the same treatment would be given to ""all those incapable of defending the homeland"".
There was no sign of Ouedraogo for more than two weeks. Then a video appeared showing him in military uniform, rifle in hand, lauding the Burkinabe army.
""It marked the start of a trend,"" said Ousmane Lankoande of the Balai Citoyen, a prominent citizens movement that played a key role in 2014 protests that ousted president Blaise Compaore, who had ruled Burkina for nearly three decades.
""We used to feel so hopeful about the future,"" Lankoande said, describing the mood after the 2014 uprising restored civil liberties. ""Today that freedom has been stolen.""
Just after Ouedraogo's arrest, in April 2023, the junta issued an emergency decree that grants authorities the right to conscript citizens above the age of 18.
The junta has used the decree only in a targeted way, avoiding widespread conscription and relying instead on recruiting volunteers to help fight the insurgency even after it came into force.
Up to 60,000 volunteers were mobilised by the end of September 2023, according to an International Crisis Group report citing an interview with the commander in charge of the volunteer brigade.
The report noted other unofficial estimates suggesting the figure was closer to 30,000.
After the decree was issued, photos and videos of well-known missing Traore critics, some in military fatigues, started circulating on social media.
They included prominent rights defender Daouda Diallo, ex-foreign minister and opposition politician Ablasse Ouedraogo, and Loure.
Reuters was able to verify their identities from their facial features but could not confirm the date or location in which the footage was taken.
Ouedraogo, 70, and Diallo, 41, were wearing what appeared to be Burkina Faso military uniforms. The images of Loure showed him holding a gun next to a police sign in a khaki outfit.
Diallo and Ouedraogo, both taken in December, were freed in March. Ouedraogo did not respond to a request for comment and Diallo declined.
When Loure arrived at the military camp in Kaya in September, there were five other conscripted activists already there and three more were brought in during his five-week stay at the camp, he said.
Three of the activists spoke to Reuters after they were discharged from the military on condition of anonymity, citing fears of retribution. One was a young militant and two were Kabore supporters in their 50s.
The three said that, before they arrived in Kaya, men in military uniform tortured them for days in an ex-ministerial villa in the Ouaga 2000 neighbourhood of Ouagadougou.
They saw other prisoners during their stay, some with severe injuries. Reuters was not able to confirm independently the details of their accounts.
An analyst and an ex-gendarme who did not wish to be named confirmed the villa's existence. The junta did not respond to questions about the villa.
Tearing up, the young activist said soldiers held his nose and mouth under an open faucet and tied plastic bags over his face.
The two older men, who were abducted together, described beatings that opened wounds on their backs into which their captors rubbed salt.
During torture sessions, all were accused of conspiracy against the state and plotting to overthrow the junta.
Once at the Kaya base, they slept on old mats on the floor of a dirty, mouse-infested storeroom, while other troops stayed in better quarters with beds and mosquito nets.
They were made to clean toilets, do laundry and wash dishes. Soldiers bullied and fired guns at some of them. They suffered daily humiliation and exhausting sports drills the older conscripts struggled to follow, they said.
""They treated us like animals,"" one of them said.
The head of the camp, Captain Emmanuel Gnoumou, oversaw lengthy whippings on arrival and other beating sessions, which he sometimes filmed, the said. Reuters was unable to contact Gnoumou for comment.
When asked about military training, all four said they were just taught basic firearm skills. The junta did not respond to requests for comment.
After a few weeks training, Loure and the young activist were sent to the frontline, they said. While Loure worked as a doctor, the activist joined a regiment of VDPs for a three-week deployment.
There were two attacks during this time, one on a nearby village and one directly on their camp, the activist said, though his unit suffered no casualties.

The two women identified as Roseline Akinyi Opiyo aged 29 and Judith Achieng Ochiel aged 28 died on the spot after they came into contact with live electric current.
Both were living at a rental house whose owner is accused of using illegal means to connect electricity to tenants.
According to assistant chief of Karading sub-location Alphonse Odero, the woman woke up on Monday to wash clothes and hanged them one of the clotheslines that was in contact with a live electric wire.
As the women were hanging their wet clothes on the line, Roseline touched the metal and was electrocuted.
Without knowing what happened, Judith Achieng rushed to help her friend who was still holding on to the wire and was also electrocuted to death on the spot.
Homa Bay County Police Commander Hassan Barua confirmed the incident.
He said preliminary investigations have revealed that the landlord had engaged in illegal connections.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/charlene-ruto-blasted-for-appearing-to-take-credit-of-countrywide-blood-drive-n345664,"Charlene Ruto blasted for appearing to take credit of countrywide blood drive
Charlene, who back in December 2023 was appointed the Kenya Blood Ambassador by the Health CS Susan Nakhumicha, on Wednesday took to her Instagram account to share a poster lauding Kenyan medics for their efforts in a massive blood drive across the country.
Part of the congratulatory poster reads: ""Thank You Kenya! Together we made the blood drive a success.""
The poster, however, was not initially designed by Ruto's team but by Dr. Austin Omondi, popularly known as Ja Prado, who originally shared it on his X account.
He wrote: ""We confirmed we had the biggest blood drive in Kenya’s history. It is possible for us to end all deaths due to lack of blood. We can reduce hospital stay and bills as we wait for blood. We did it guys! And we shall do even bigger things.""
Soon after Charlene re-shared the poster, many doctors, especially on X, immediately took issue with her involvement in the matter - and what appeared to be an attempt to insert herself into a success she wasn't a part of.
One person said, ""Please @charlruto have some shame and don’t take credit for work that was done by other people. You are not with us, you are not like us!""
Popular X personality Dr. Salim Ishmael also took issue, simply writing, ""We were not associated with @charlruto. Thank you!""
Dr. Caroline Ngetich, yet another medical professional, also chimed in, saying, ""Does she understand that people actually donated blood because her father's regime killed and harmed innocent Kenyans? How can you now jump onto this conversation without shame? This is outrageous!""
Dr. Omondi's initiative, which covered the entire country, saw thousands of Kenyans come out in droves to donate blood for injured protesters across various Kenyan towns.
Official figures shared by the Kenya Tissue and Transplant Authority (KTTA) show that the blood drive managed to collect 8,900 pints of blood nationwide.
Nairobi County led with 2500 pints, Mombasa collected 1500 pints, Nakuru did 1300 pints and Kisumu 1100 pints.
Despite being the Kenya Blood Ambassador, a position she had held for the last seven months, Charlene Ruto has been conspicuously absent when it came to initiatives meant to mass-donate blood for the victims of police brutality during the anti-government demos.
The nationwide blood drives have mostly been conducted by doctors on X, with the notable effort of Dr. Austin Omondi alongside several of his compatriots.

Erik ten Hag has signed a contract extension that keeps him at Old Trafford until 2026, the Premier League club announced on Thursday.
There had been intense speculation over the Dutchman's future after a poor 2023/24 Premier League campaign but he guided the club to FA Cup success against Manchester City.
It was widely leaked in the British media last month that after a review by the club's new part-owner, British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe, Ten Hag would be staying at the club.
""Erik ten Hag has extended his contract as Manchester United men's first-team manager until June 2026,"" United said in a statement.
The former Ajax manager, whose deal had been due to expire in 2025, admitted there was work to be done to close the gap on United's Premier League rivals.
""Looking back at the past two years, we can reflect with pride on two trophies and many examples of progression from where we were when I joined,"" he said.
""However, we must also be clear that there is still lots of hard work ahead to reach the levels expected of Manchester United, which means challenging for English and European titles.""
Dan Ashworth, Manchester United sporting director, said: ""With two trophies in the past two seasons, Erik has reinforced his record as one of the most consistently successful coaches in European football.
""While the club's review of last season highlighted areas for improvement, it also reached a clear conclusion that Erik was the best partner for us to work with in driving up standards and outcomes.""
Ten Hag, 54, ended a six-year trophy drought for United in his first season by lifting the League Cup in 2023 and finished third in the league, encouraging fans that they might launch a Premier League title bid in 2023/24.
But they lost 14 games and ended with a negative goal difference, finishing a whopping 31 points behind champions Manchester City.

Published on: July 03, 2024 11:08 (EAT)
Bars and cafes in the French capital will be allowed to stay open round-the-clock for the opening and closing ceremonies of the Paris Olympics, a city decree said Wednesday.
The decision ""is linked to a range of free festivities organised by the city, away from the sports venues"" and is justified ""by the exceptional nature of the opening and closing ceremonies,"" the ruling from the city prefect says.
It means bars will be able to stay open all night on July 26, when the Olympics are set to open with a boat parade on the river Seine, as well as the closing ceremony on August 11.
The same exception to licensing rules will be made for the opening of the Paralympic Games on August 28 and the closing ceremony on September 8.
The decree states that bar owners ""remain in these exceptional circumstances the guarantors of public order inside their establishments.""
The City of Light has around 15,000 bars, many of which close during the month of August for the summer holidays in normal years.
Several residents' associations, including ""Droit au Sommeil"" (The Right to Sleep), have been critical of moves by Paris authorities to extend licensing hours for temporary outdoor eating and drinking areas during the Games.
Those establishments will be able to serve until midnight, instead of 10pm as usual.

https://www.citizen.digital/business/explainer-why-you-could-lose-your-land-to-govt-if-mps-pass-new-bill-n344901,"Explainer: Why you could lose your land to Gov’t if MPs pass new Bill
The ongoing discourse on Finance Bill, 2024
has brought to the forefront a number of other issues that the public has
expressed skepticism about, among them the proposal to amend the Land Act of
2012.
The Land Amendment Bill number 2 of 2023
proposes to insert a new clause which will force freehold land owners, property
owners who enjoy free ownership for perpetuity and can use the land for any
purposes, to pay land rent.
According to the Bill, the Land Act 2012 is
amended by inserting the new section immediately after section 54 which states
that the owner of any freehold land within the boundaries of any urban area or
city shall pay an annual land levy equivalent to the land rent charged on a
comparable leasehold property of the same size in the same zone.
Experts however opine that if enacted, the
amendments, currently awaiting scheduling for second reading before Parliament,
could see hundreds of Kenyans lose their property to the government.
According to Dr. Mwenda Makathimo, the
Executive Director of Land Development and Governance Institute (LDGI), this
translates to taxing Kenyans for owning land in urban areas.
""This means the government is charging
you a tax for owning freehold land which is not government land. That is what
this Act will bring. Land you might have inherited from your parents or land
that you might have bought is freehold land,"" he told Citizen TV.
""Imposing this annual levy on land that
is freehold property essentially has the effect of converting freehold property
into leasehold property and by that, running the risk of dispossessing many
Kenyans who may not afford to pay the levy and this includes indigenous people
whose lands are ancestral,"" Eva Makori, Acting Regional Coordinator,
International Land Coalition (ILC) Africa added.
The Bill, sponsored by Ruiru Member of
Parliament Simon King’ara, could further give the Lands Cabinet Secretary power
to acquire land compulsorily whenever the county or the national government determines
that there is need to acquire a particular piece of land.
This, Dr. Makathimo believes, will be
retrogressive in the long run, adding that the Bill is taking away the power
from an independent commission and this could leave Kenyans counting losses
should there be need for compulsory acquisitions.
""This brings in more risks; risks that
can lead to arbitrary denial of property rights as provided under article 40;
arbitrary denial of just compensation in case of compulsory acquisition for
public purpose, so therefore the amendment is retrogressive,"" he said.
""It is returning Kenya to the framework
where land was managed and held on behalf of the President before the 2010 Constitution.""
""Any amendment should not be contrary to
the current title or interest that the person holds. if the Constitution says
you have a right to property then that should be protected. If the land law
says you have a freehold interest and that interest carries an ultimate or
superior title, where you are not paying annual land rate then that should be
considered,"" Marjorie Kivuva, Partner. Tarra Agility Africa, added.
Despite claims by the government through National
Assembly Majority Leader Kimani Ichung'wah that there is no such a Bill,
Citizen TV has learned that the Bill has gone through all the steps at the
National Assembly and is currently at the Senate.

The duo, currently visiting Kenya, emphasised the importance of voicing one's opinions in a civil and just manner that doesn't infringe another person's rights.
They noted that such spirit embodies the call upheld by his father, Dr King in the 1950s.
""My father and mother held an unwavering commitment to non-violence and civil rights which transformed the landscape of America and inspired movements for justice and equality worldwide. We stand before you today on your land here in Kenya not as strangers but as fellow travellers on the road to peace, justice and equity. The world watches Kenya as its citizens take to the streets to make their voices heard in protests,"" he said.
""We implore you to remember the profound power of non-violent protests. It is a profound expression of moral courage. It is a powerful and just weapon which cuts without wounding and nobles the man who wields it.""
They also expressed grief over the death of protestors during the demonstrations and urged the police officers to use non-violent tactics.
President William Ruto, in his state briefing on Wednesday, confirmed that six people died in the demonstrations and 214 were injured. From this, 95 were already discharged from hospitals while 14 were still receiving medical treatment.
""We are deeply saddened by the tragic deaths of protestors and violence and burning parts of the Parliament building. We implore protestors and security forces to use non-violent tactics at this time,"" she noted.
""The greatest legislative strides my dad and his team made such as the passing of the Civil Rights Act were realised through non-violent tactics. My parents envisioned a non-violent community based on justice, equal opportunity and love for one's fellow human beings.""

https://www.citizen.digital/news/joe-bidens-disastrous-debate-blamed-on-bad-preparation-exhaustion-n344977,"Joe Biden's disastrous debate blamed on bad preparation, exhaustion
Trump, 78, repeated a series of well-worn, glaring falsehoods during the 90-minute debate on Thursday, including claims that he actually won the 2020 election.
Biden, 81, failed to refute them and his fumbling, halting performance has sparked calls from Democrats for him to end his quest for a second term and for ""soul-searching"" or resignations among top aides.
""My only request was make sure he's rested before the debate, but he was exhausted. He was unwell,"" said one person who said they appealed to Biden's top aides in the days before, to no avail. ""What a bad decision to send him out looking sick and exhausted.""
Others were even more pointed.
""It is my belief that he was over-coached, over-practiced. And I believe [senior aide] Anita Dunn... put him in a venue that was conducive for Trump and not for him,” said John Morgan, a Florida-based attorney and major Biden fundraiser.
Morgan said Dunn and her husband, Bob Bauer, the president’s attorney who played Trump in pre-debate rehearsals, should ""be fired forever and never let back anywhere near the campaign.""
Biden's debate strategy was signed off on by campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, who helped him win in 2020 and was appointed in January to boost an uneven reelection campaign. Dunn, a longtime Biden aide and former Barack Obama campaign strategist, backed that strategy.
Confidence going into the event was high. Trump was convicted of falsifying documents by a jury in New York on May 31, while Biden held back-to-back visits in Europe.
To the surprise of some Biden aides, his stubbornly low poll numbers began to inch up nationally in the weeks that followed.
Advisers set up a rigorous debate prep calendar, with Biden sequestered at Camp David for six days.
An inner circle, some close to Biden for decades, were involved: Ron Klain, his first White House chief of staff, Dunn, former White House counsel and long-time adviser Mike Donilon, as well as about a dozen other policy and political experts.
Biden's campaign said on Friday that no staff shake-up was under consideration. Multiple aides, not just Dunn and Bauer, were involved in the preparation, said a campaign official, who also noted that Morgan was not there.
In an email to supporters Saturday, O'Malley Dillon said internal polls and focus groups showed no change in voters' opinions in battleground states after the debate. She warned ""overblown media narratives"" may drive ""temporary dips in the polls,"" but said she was confident Biden would win in November.
FACTS AND ZINGERS
Biden's trips abroad, especially to France earlier this month, generated Republican social media clips poking fun at his age but, his team believed, it also showed him as a strong leader on an international stage.
White House aides who traveled with the president were in a good mood as he headed to Camp David on June 21. They believed Biden was going into the debate with the most precious political asset: momentum, the wind at his back.
Biden had flown to France, back to the United States, to Italy, and to the West Coast, among other travels, over a 14-day period before taking just a few days to rest at his vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.
He was dragging, according to several people who observed him during this period.
As Biden and his aides settled in at Camp David six days before the debate, aides figured he had a lot to accomplish, more than his opponent. Trump could just complain about the present administration - and Biden would need the facts and some zingers at his fingertips.
They expected Trump would be far more disciplined and prepared than he had been in 2020 and believed that they would need to counter a string of rapid-fire lies.
In lengthy prep sessions, they peppered Biden with details, then followed them up with mock debates.
Critics say now that the preparation should have focused on the bigger vision he needs to sell to the country, and that Biden had insufficient rest headed into the debate.
Run down, Biden would also catch a small cold, White House aides said, as he has regularly during his term after long stretches of time zone-bending work.
The result, critics say, was candidate Biden at his worst: He appeared on stage with his face wan, his hair straggly at his collar and his voice hoarse. He was frequently incoherent.
""I've never seen him perform that way before,"" said Michael LaRosa, former special assistant to President Biden and press secretary for first lady Jill Biden.
""He can run circles around most people on matters of complex policy,"" LaRosa said. ""This was always going to be a matter of presentation and cosmetics, and superficial judgments that were going to be made about his performance. And he wasn't able to clear the bar.""
NEW DEBATE FORUM
Earlier this year, some Biden aides discussed whether he should debate Trump at all, arguing that it could give Trump a broad public platform that would disadvantage Biden.
Then Biden himself, in an April interview with shock jock Howard Stern, delivered a decision on debating Trump that was a surprise to some advisers. ""I am, somewhere,"" he said.
The triumphant memory of his State of the Union address in March fresh in their minds, Biden's team geared up to debate but took radical steps to control the terms.
They decided to reject three long-scheduled presidential debates in September and October organized by the Commission on Presidential Debates, still smarting over the group's handling of the 2020 debates.
Trump repeatedly violated the rules of what would be a chaotic first debate in 2020, showing up despite having tested positive for COVID-19, and talking over Biden relentlessly.
His team tried to set the contest on their own terms, with what they saw as a more pliant host in CNN. No audience cheering Trump's invective. Networks and moderators inclined to challenge Trump. No Robert F. Kennedy Jr. A mute button.
The day after the debate, Biden bounced back with a forceful speech in North Carolina, and a pledge to keep going. Many donors and Democrats are rallying around him.
But the damage has been done.
Asked on Sunday whether the Democratic Party was discussing a new 2024 candidate, Maryland Congressman Jamie Raskin told MSNBC: ""There are very honest and serious and rigorous conversations taking place at every level of our party, because it is a political party and we have differences in point of view.""
Raskin added: ""Whether he's the candidate or someone else is the candidate, he's going to be the keynote speaker at our convention.""

Alice Nekesa, whose daughter, Caroline Shiramba, 35, lost her life during Tuesday’s protests, has had her life turned upside down.
Speaking on Wednesday, she said her daughter went to meet her at the market where she sells fruits in Ikolomani on the fateful evening and said she would have an early supper before proceeding home.
“All of a sudden, we saw a group of people approaching as officers engaged them in running battles,” she said.
She lost contact with her daughter in the fracas and a little while later, she said she heard people screaming that a woman had been killed.
“I didn’t know who it was that had been shot at first,” Alice said.
She proceeded to spend the night at a friend’s house for fear the route to her house was unsafe following the demos.
On proceeding to her business the following morning, Alcie said a fellow vendor approached her, condoling with her over “my loss”.
“I asked him why he was telling me sorry… He proceeded to tell me that he saw my daughter was shot by officers during the fracas the previous evening,” she said.
She said she was in denial as the man proceeded to say that her body was now at the mortuary.
“I told him he probably had confused my daughter with someone else. However, I did go to the mortuary and confirmed my worst fears that it was indeed her,” she said.
Morris Shiramba, Caroline’s mother, called for justice to be served, adding that they had lost the breadwinner in their home.
“I am a retiree and Caroline’s mother and I depended on her,” he said.
At least 29 people have been killed across the country, and dozens injured in the protests against the Finance Bill 2023.
The protests led to President William Ruto rejecting the Bill on Wednesday and sending a memo back to Parliament with his recommendations that all clauses of the Bill be dropped.

However, a section of residents from the the communities, lead by those from the Marakwet community, have come together to call for the embracing of culture as a tool to restore peace and foster unity.
Some of the activities being used to foster unity are the use of songs and cultural festivals.
Speaking to Wananchi Reporting during a celebration of culture held at Moi Kapsowar Girls' School on Monday, Rose Kibet, a local, said, “Our traditional attire plays a significant role in our community. When you see members of the community adorning belts and beadwork on their feet, it is a sign of bravery. It means that even when we are faced by adversaries, we are able to emerge victorious.”
Wesley Korir, another resident, said, “When we engage in the activity of exchanging cultural practices, each community gains an understanding of what the other is about and we are therefore able to foster unity.”
elgeyomarakwet county government together with kapsowar ward representative joshua kipruto together said that the system of celebrating community cultures helps a lot in maintaining peace and uniting communities that for a long time have been at fight.
County executive for Culture, Purity Koima, said, “The use of song and dance is important and effective in fostering unity because each of the communities appreciates song and dance.”
Those attending the festival said that it is a good opportunity to nurture the talent of locals.

https://www.citizen.digital/wananchi-reporting/wananchi-opinion-is-kenya-breeding-a-reserve-army-of-labour-enter-gen-z-n344779,"WANANCHI OPINION: Is Kenya breeding a reserve army of labour? Enter Gen Z
Karl Marx warned about the danger of creating the ""Reserve Army of labour"" where the ranks of the unemployed who – through the absence of any meaningful choice – are prepared to work for very low wages in temporary jobs.
His thesis on the Class Struggle between the bourgeoisie and Proletariat and the control of the means of production is playing out before our eyes. The rise of Gen Z is by no means an accident; one could have predicted it ages ago.
For a long time, Azimio leader Raila Odinga played a galvanizing role in politics, keeping the Reserve Army away from the periphery of power. He was the voice of protests.
The debate about corruption, pilferage of resources, and nepotism was associated with Raila’s Struggle.
Once he exited the political scene, there was a visible vacuum in rising against perceived oppression, and the Gen Zs readily filled it. The Leaderless and eclectic Reserve Army, depending on TikTok for persuasion and convictions, is more dangerous than an active nuclear facility.
No other agitation has reached what the Gen Z did. No one could have ever imagined breaching the walls of Parliament; let alone invading the chambers and visiting the office of the Chief Justice of Kenya; the two arms of the government. Gen Z did it.
Matters have also been worsened by reports of torture that occurred in Githurai night.
Gen Z has presented a consequential period in the history of Kenya; rewriting of political agitation, a mixture of teenage exuberance, style, streetwise occupation, energy and restive public; a debt-ridden economy, and apprehensive parliamentarians.
The involvement of religious facilities in accommodating the protesters shows a wavering sign of sympathy with Gen Z.
Abductions, on the other hand, show panic in some government quarters.
Make no mistake; Gen Z has entered a new period of political reformation in Kenya. Whether this protest will upend politics during an election, no one knows.
I have worked in war-torn countries like Somalia for over a decade and can smell tragedy in the air before it comes. The president must take a strategic retreat, listen to Kenyans, who overwhelmingly support Gen Zs, or face the consequences of the reserve army takeover.

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/djokovic-murray-launch-wimbledon-campaigns-n345025,"Djokovic, Murray launch Wimbledon campaigns
Wimbledon greats Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray launch their
campaigns at the All England Club on Tuesday after both went under the knife in
the build-up to the Grand Slam.
Djokovic, who had a knee operation after pulling out before
his French Open quarter-final, is chasing a record-equalling eighth men's
Wimbledon title and opens against Czech qualifier Vit Kopriva.
Britain's Murray, a two-time champion, takes on another
Czech, Tomas Machac, just over a week after having surgery to remove a cyst
from his spine, in his farewell appearance at the tournament.
Also in action on the second day of the Championships is women's world number one and five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek, eager to progress beyond the quarter-finals for the first time.
Novak Djokovic v Vit
Kopriva
World number two Novak Djokovic has declared himself
""pain-free"" after initial fears he would miss Wimbledon following surgery
to repair a torn meniscus.
The Serbian has not played since he was forced to withdraw
from the French Open before his last-eight tie against Casper Ruud.
Now 37, he knows time is not on his side as he bids to equal
Roger Federer's Wimbledon record and become the first player -- man or woman --
to win 25 Grand Slam singles titles.
Djokovic, who practised with a knee support on Sunday, said
he had an ""incredible desire"" to play"".
He arrives in London without a title to his name this
season, losing his Australian Open crown and the number one ranking to
22-year-old Jannik Sinner.
The Serbian, who has reached the past five finals at
Wimbledon, faces Vit Kopriva, ranked 123rd, for the first time in his career.
Andy Murray v Tomas
Machac
It has been a case of ""will he or won't he?"" in
the build-up to Wimbledon for home hero Andy Murray after his operation just
over a week before the start of the tournament.
The 37-year-old is hoping to finish his career at the
upcoming Paris Olympics but desperately wants to make a final appearance in
London.
The injury-ravaged Scot has slipped to 113th in the world
rankings but it now appears he will get his dream of a send-off at Wimbledon,
where he is also listed to play doubles alongside brother Jamie.
The former world number one is due to face 39th-ranked Tomas
Machac on Centre Court on Tuesday, with emotions running high.
The Czech player leads 2-0 in head-to-heads, with both wins
coming this year.
""I'm hoping maybe for a bit of closure,"" said
Murray, who won the Wimbledon title in 2013 and 2016.
""I just want the opportunity to play one more time out there, hopefully on Centre Court, and feel that buzz.""
Iga Swiatek v Sofia
Kenin
World number one Iga Swiatek arrives at the All England Club
on the back of a 19-match winning streak but with lingering questions over
whether she can transfer her clay-court form to the grass.
Swiatek, who has won five trophies already this year, has
not played a warm-up tournament on grass, opting to withdraw from the Berlin
event in order to rest.
Last year's quarter-final appearance was her best showing so
far at Wimbledon but the Pole, 23, is justifiably tipped to go far at this
year's Wimbledon, where she clinched the junior title in 2018.
First up is Sofia Kenin, whom Swiatek defeated in the first
round of the Australian Open this year.
The 49th-ranked US player has struggled this season but she
has experience of the sharp end of Grand Slams, triumphing at the 2020
Australian Open before losing to Swiatek in the final of the French Open months
later.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/anti-finance-bill-protests-what-is-treason-n344685,"Anti-Finance Bill protests: What is treason?
After Tuesday’s day-long nationwide protests
against the unpopular Finance Bill 2024 that culminated in crowds breaking
through police lines and breaching Parliament buildings in Nairobi, President
William Ruto late in the evening denounced the day’s events as treasonous.
In the demonstrations at the capital, angry
crowds broke through the Parliament barricades past the heavy police presence
around 3 p.m. after legislators passed the bill, which now awaits presidential
assent to become law.
The ceremonial mace, which symbolizes the authority of the legislature, was stolen, some parts of the parliament building vandalised and a section of it set on fire.
Police fired live ammunition at the mob, killing at least five people and injuring over 30 others, according to Amnesty International.
Moments later, the nearby City Hall, which houses the Nairobi Governor’s office, was also set on fire.
President Ruto in a televised late evening address
from State House Nairobi said “organised criminals” hijacked a “critical
conversation” on the proposed law -- which seeks to hike taxes -- and caused havoc.
Terming the events a threat to national
security, the president vowed to crack down on the “planners, financiers, orchestrators
and abetters of violence and anarchy” and deployed the military to back the
police force’s security enforcement.
Over 125 people were injured in the day’s
events, the human rights organisation HAKI Africa said.
Treason is a major offence against the State. It is defined as conduct which comprises a breach of allegiance owed to
the State.
The crime falls under offences against
public order as defined in Section 40 of the Penal Code.
Per the law, the State has a duty to
protect its citizens and those who reside in it. Similarly, the citizens and the
residents owe allegiance to the State and when this allegiance is broken, it is
termed as treason against the State.
The Penal Code spells out that treason can
occur when a person who owes allegiance to the republic, in Kenya or elsewhere,
compasses, imagines, invents, devises or intends the death, maiming or
wounding, or the imprisonment or restraint, of the president.
It is also treasonous to depose, by
unlawful means, the president from his position or from the style, honour Head
of State and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Kenya.
It also includes overthrowing, by unlawful
means, the Kenyan government.
The law states that anyone who expresses,
utters or declares any such compassings, imaginations, inventions, devices or
intentions by publishing or writing or by any overt act or deed, is guilty of
the offence of treason.
“Any person who, owing allegiance to the
Republic levies war in Kenya against the Republic; or is adherent to the
enemies of the Republic, or gives them aid or comfort, in Kenya or elsewhere;
or instigates whether in Kenya or elsewhere any person to invade Kenya with an
armed force, is guilty of the offence of treason,” the Constitution states.
Any person guilty of the offence of treason shall be sentenced to death, says the law.

Published on: July 09, 2024 09:23 (EAT)

Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz will attempt to set up a blockbuster Wimbledon semi-final on Tuesday, confirming their status as the pathfinders of tennis's next generation.
Lulu Sun, the unheralded qualifier from a remote town in New Zealand, aims to become only the second woman from her country to reach a Grand Slam semi-final.
World number one Jannik Sinner and fifth-ranked Daniil Medvedev have clashed 11 times and their head-to-head reflects the rise of the beanpole Italian.
Medvedev won all of the pair's first six meetings while Sinner has swept the past five.
All have come on hard courts, including the Italian's fightback from two sets down to defeat Medvedev in January's Australian Open final, his first Grand Slam title.
Both men were losing semi-finalists at the All England Club in 2023.
""When Jannik came on tour, he hit strong from every position of the court, but he was missing a lot and losing matches,"" said Russia's Medvedev.
""Then he stopped missing less and now it's very tough to beat him. That's why he's number one in the world.""
Sinner's vanquished last-16 opponent Ben Shelton was left in awe of the Italian's hitting power.
""The ball was moving so fast, I wasn't even seeing it,"" said the American.
Alcaraz dreams of sporting double
Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz faces Tommy Paul, the American 12th seed, hoping to reach a sixth Grand Slam semi-final.
The 21-year-old will be desperate to have his Wimbledon business done and dusted in time to settle in front of a television to see Spain take on France in the Euro 2024 semi-finals in Germany.
Alcaraz is good friends with Spain captain Alvaro Morata.
""It's time to support them, as I know they are supporting me when I'm playing matches or I'm playing tournaments,"" said Alcaraz.
""Hopefully on Tuesday we are not going to play at the same time.""
Alcaraz is seeking to become just the sixth man to capture the French Open and Wimbledon titles back to back.
The 27-year-old Paul is in his first Wimbledon quarter-final but arrived at the tournament having won the Queen's title on grass.
He has also won two of his four meetings against Alcaraz.
Small town Sun in Grand Slam big time
Lulu Sun is the first New Zealand woman to reach the Wimbledon quarter-finals and is bidding to become only the second Kiwi woman to reach a Slam semi-final after Belinda Cordwell at the 1989 Australian Open.
Ranked at 123, Sun came through qualifying and has defeated eighth-ranked Australian Open runner-up Zheng Qinwen as well as 2021 US Open champion Emma Raducanu.
The 23-year-old left-hander, who hails from a small town on New Zealand's South Island, which she described as having ""more sheep and deer than people"", has crunched 21 aces through four rounds.
And her all-or-nothing game has produced a tournament-leading 162 winners but also 131 unforced errors.
Sun's opponent Donna Vekic, a former top-20 player with four titles, is also in her first Wimbledon quarter-final but made the last eight at the 2019 US Open and 2023 Australian Open.
""I don't know a lot about her,"" said Vekic of Sun. ""But no-one makes the quarter-finals of Wimbledon by accident.""
From nowhere to everywhere for Paolini
Until this year, Jasmine Paolini had never made it past the second round of a Grand Slam in 16 appearances.
That changed with a fourth-round run at the Australian Open followed by a runner-up finish to Iga Swiatek at Roland Garros.
Standing at just 1.63m (5ft 4ins), the seventh-ranked Italian, who plays Emma Navarro in the last eight, admits she has surprised herself.
""A part of me, I didn't really believe,"" said the 28-year-old after Madison Keys retired injured from their last-16 match.
""It's a little bit also strange to be in this position.""
Navarro, the 17th-ranked American, is also breaking new ground as she prepares for her first Grand Slam quarter-final.
The 23-year-old New York-born player stunned world number two and US Open champion Coco Gauff in the fourth round.
Navarro has the upper hand on Paolini, defeating her three times in the past 10 months -- in San Diego, Doha and Miami.

Moturi’s bid to have the high court overturn his conviction and sentence, initially imposed by Chief Magistrate Lawrence Mugambi in 2022, was declined.
Moturi, who had been head of the department responsible for purchasing shares, was fined Ksh.2.6 billion and sentenced to 14 years in prison for his role in the Ksh.1.2 billion loss at the pension fund.
He was convicted alongside officials of Discount Securities Limited (DSL) among them Isack Nyakundi, Wilfred Munyoro, and David Githaiga. Discount Securities Limited was also convicted.
Dissatisfied with the verdict, Moturi and the other parties appealed. However, Judge Sifuna upheld their convictions and sentences, emphasizing the importance of accountability in the management of public funds.
Trial Magistrate Lawrence Mugambi fined the three former DSL employees Ksh.803 million each or 12 years in jail.
Discount Securities Limited was directed to pay a fine of Ksh.4 billion for failure to which its assets were to be auctioned.
The convicts were accused of defrauding NSSF by purchasing non-existent shares between August 2002 and July 2007.
As the investment manager, Moturi was expected to act with diligence, prudence, and honesty according to the high court.

Published on: July 05, 2024 04:07 (EAT)
Netherlands coach Ronald Koeman wants his team to quiet Turkey's raucous fans in their Euro 2024 quarter-final clash on Saturday in Berlin.
With a large Turkish diaspora across Germany, Vincenzo Montella's side have been fervently backed this summer and Dutch defender Daley Blind said the clash at the Olympiastadion will feel like an ""away"" game.
""I've got some experience against Turkish teams, the atmosphere is always great,"" Koeman told a news conference Friday.
""We just need to keep the ball and they will become quiet. You need to be cool, business-like and play your game.""
The Netherlands started slowly at the Euros, creeping through the group phase as one of the best third-place teams, but thrashed Romania 3-0 in the last 16 in a much brighter display.
""The last match was at a really good level football-wise, if we keep that level then it can be a really good tournament for us,"" continued Koeman, who captained the Dutch to their sole Euros triumph in 1988.
""Every match is difficult, all the big teams have struggled in different matches to win them -- England scored in the last seconds, Portugal won on penalties. You have to fight for it.""
Netherlands were hurting from a 3-2 defeat by Austria in their final group game which Koeman called ""appalling"" and responded strongly against Romania.
The former Barcelona coach said they did not need that kind of inspiration to play well against Turkey.
""If you want to have a good game, you don't need to have a defeat first -- not an Austria all over again,"" said Koeman.
""You need to do it by yourself, the players are standing in front of a semi-final, it's an opportunity to progress in this tournament.""
Dutch defender Denzel Dumfries agreed with his coach. ""I don't need extra-motivation for this game, it's a Euros quarter-final, it's great to be here... and none of the other players need it either,"" said the Inter Milan full-back.
""We will need to have good possession and enough energy.""
Dumfries admitted the expected Turkish dominance in the stands could complicate things for his side.
""Everybody knows how important this game is, we know what we can expect in terms of the atmosphere in the stadium... it's probably a bit more difficult to hear each other,"" he said.
""We've seen how great our fans are (too)... they will support us, we need to play the game on the field, but it will definitely give us a boost.""

(Photo by EDUARDO MUNOZ / AFP)
Panama left the USA's hopes of qualifying for the Copa America knockout rounds hanging by a thread on Thursday after scoring a shock 2-1 victory over the host nation.
A stormy Group C battle in Atlanta saw both sides finish with 10 men as Panama came from behind to snatch a victory which reignites their Copa campaign after an opening loss to Uruguay.
The game turned on a moment of madness in the 18th minute, when US winger Timothy Weah was sent off for striking Panama defender Roderick Miller in the face in an off-the-ball incident spotted by VAR.
Although Folarin Balogun fired the US into the lead with a screamer from the edge of the area after 22 minutes, Panama got back on level terms only minutes later after Cesar Blackman's strike.
As the game wore on, however, Panama's one-man advantage began to take its toll on the weary US side.
The US might have snatched the lead in the 81st minute after Weston McKennie's fine run and cross found substitute Ricardo Pepi at the far post. Pepi's tame header fell into the arms of Panama goalkeeper Orlando Mosquera, however, to leave it at 1-1.
That miss proved costly, as with seven minutes remaining, Jose Fajardo swept in an emphatic finish from Abdiel Ayarza's low cross to put Panama 2-1 ahead.
A fractious finale saw Adalberto Carrasquilla sent off after a cynical hack on US captain Christian Pulisic in the dying minutes as Panama hung on for the win.
""That's soccer at the end of the day. We know what we signed up for and playing in a Copa America, we knew it was going to be a fight,"" US midfielder Tyler Adams said afterwards.
""Credit to Panama, they did their job and they got the result. Obviously, I think moving forward, we need to control our emotions in certain situations.
""The team fought for everything after we got the red card. Definitely can't fault the effort. But by winning the first game we've put ourselves still in a position that we have all to fight for in the next game.""
Adams said Weah had apologized for his rash dismissal following the game.
""You never mean to get a red card, under any circumstances,"" Adams said of Weah. ""He's not that type of person.
""He apologized to the team. And you know, just respect to the rest of the team because they they fought for every single ball, every single duel, every single minute, and we still created chances even after going down to 10 men.""
The defeat means the USA may well need to beat South American heavyweights Uruguay in their final group game next Monday to qualify for the quarter-finals.
Uruguay play Bolivia in Thursday's late game in Group C.

Reacting to a newspaper headline ""Why days are numbered for Ruto advisers"", Ndii said he will be glad to be relieved of his duties as one of the key advisers to the president.
""You don't know how relieved I’d be,"" Ndii said.
Asked why he can not resign from his position, the controversial economist said he is not a quitter, adding that quitters are losers.
He said he cannot resign because he is not a loser. Ndii insisted on staying put until the day Ruto himself fired him.
This comes after Ruto announced a list of austerity measures he plans to take to cut down government spending, following the rejection of the Finance Bill 2024.
Among the measures is the reduction of advisers in government by at least 50% with immediate effect.
Ruto also announced the removal of budgets allocated to unconstitutional offices of the First Lady, the second and spouse to the Prime Cabinet Secretary.
Further, Ruto said confidential budgets in Executive offices will be removed and that at least 47 state corporations with overlapping functions will be dissolved, with employees in those corporations moved to other ministries.
The austerity measures were as a result of sustained countrywide protests that saw protesters storm parliament when MPs passed the controversial Finance Bill 2024.
The protests turned tragic, with at least 42 people killed by security forces. Ruto was forced to eat a humble pie and rejected the bill.

In the 2024/25 budget, the Judiciary was set to receive Ksh.24 billion to fund all expenses but with the new directive, they will be allocated Ksh.20 billion.
According to JSC chairperson Chief Justice Martha Koome , the directive will have far-reaching consequences on Judiciary operations and hence necessitating major adjustments to planned programs including suspending the recruitment of 11 Court of Appeal judges which was set to commence on Wednesday.
Koome argued that pending cases will be affected.
""Currently, the Court of Appeal has a total of 29 Judges serving in only six stations across the country which translates to 9 benches at any given time. The court had a total of 13, 331 pending cases as at May 2024,"" the statement read in part.
Further, the JSC pointed out that the death of Magistrate Monica Kivuti of the Makadara Law Courts necessitated a restructuring and reallocation of the budget to meet security arrangements to provide a safe environment for all users of the courts.
""The Judiciary will therefore require additional resources in the FY 2024/2025 to address these immediate concerns.""
CJ Koome promised to engage Parliament and Executive to enhance and secure the Judiciary's budget.
The new directive is in line with the austerity measures promised by President William Ruto to cut across all arms of the government following the rejection of the Finance Bill.
Ruto also noted that budgetary expenses towards offices of the First and Second Lady would be scrapped and also promised to reduce salaries for public officers to reflect the current state of the affairs in the country.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/dedicated-inspirational-president-ruto-mourns-bishop-allan-kiuna-n345573,"‘Dedicated, inspirational’: President Ruto mourns Bishop Allan Kiuna
President William Ruto has eulogised Bishop
Allan Kiuna as a dedicated and inspirational Christian leader.
Kiuna, co-founder of the Jubilee Christian
Church (JCC), died at a Nairobi hospital on Tuesday aged 57.
In a post on X, Ruto said he was saddened
by Bishop Kiuna’s passing, describing him as an inspiration to many people of
the Christian faith.
“It is with profound sorrow that I learned
of the passing of Bishop Allan Kiuna. I join the Christian community in
mourning his death. Bishop Kiuna was a dedicated Christian leader who founded
the Jubilee Christian Church (JCC) and inspired many to follow the teachings of
the Lord,” wrote the President.
“To his wife, Rev. Kathy Kiuna and family we stand with you in this time of grief and mourning, and pray that you find the courage to persevere through this trying period. May he rest in peace.”
Reverend Kiuna in 2019 revealed that her husband
was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer the previous year.
The bishop would in 2022 seek treatment in
the United States, where he ended up spending a year and upon his return last
year announced he was cancer-free.
He told his Nairobi church on December 10,
2023, that his treatment cost over $3 million (nearly Ksh.460 million at the
time).
But the controversial bishop told the faithful
that not a single coin out of this amount came from his own pockets “because
the God of heaven provided.”
“Don’t get bitter with the process. If you
get bitter with the process, you shall abort your purpose. I am not bitter
about the process because I am better. My best days are ahead of me,” Bishop
Kiuna said then.
The Kiunas founded JCC in 1999 and the
church gained popularity among a section of the city’s middle class and several
local celebrities.
The church has however attracted
controversy as the congregants often referred to the founding couple as 'Daddy'
and 'Mummy'.
The couple was also criticised for parading their lavish lifestyle online, including pictures on a private jet. Their critics have also accused them of preaching prosperity theology.
Bishop Kiuna however dismissed the backlash saying, “A
tiger is not bothered about the opinion of the sheep.”
“…You have to get to a place where you just
keep doing what God has called you to do, and do it with all faithfulness, with
all humility. But don’t ever be detoured by the words of the haters because
people will always hate,” he said in a 2014 interview.
In 2016, the bishop published a book
titled ‘Living in Financial Distinction’.
To honour Bishop Kiuna's legacy, JCC has
organised a series of memorial services from Wednesday, July 10 through Sunday,
July 14.

""The Islamic Republic has always supported the resistance of the people of the region against the illegitimate Zionist regime,"" Pezeshkian said in a message to Hassan Nasrallah, leader of the Iran-backed Lebanese Hezbollah group.
The comments signaled no change in the regional policies of the incoming government under the relatively moderate Pezeshkian, who defeated his hardline rival in last week’s runoff election.
""I am certain that the resistance movements in the region will not allow this regime to continue its warmongering and criminal policies against the oppressed people of Palestine and other nations of the region,"" Iranian media quoted Pezeshkian as saying.
Shiite Muslim Hezbollah and the Palestinian Sunni Muslim Hamas are part of a group of Iranian-backed factions in the region known as the Axis of Resistance.
Israel did not immediately comment on Pezeshkian's remarks.
Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza began after the Islamist militant group that governs the Palestinian enclave led an attack on southern Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.
More than 38,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military offensive and nearly 88,000 have been wounded, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

Uruguay beat Brazil on penalties (4-2) to reach the semi-finals of Copa America after an ugly game ended goalless on Saturday.
Uruguay, who finished the game with ten men after Nahitan Nandez was sent off in the 74th minute, will face Colombia in Charlotte, North Carolina, in their semi-final on Wednesday.
Colombia, now unbeaten in 27 games, beat Panama 5-0 in Saturday's other quarter-final earlier in Arizona.
The other semi-final, in New Jersey on Tuesday, will see world champions Argentina face surprise package Canada.
For five-times world champions Brazil it was a disappointing early end to a tournament in which they never truly clicked, and a lot of work remains to be done if Dorival Junior's team are to be in shape to compete for the title in the 2026 World Cup.
In a city better known for boxing than for the beautiful game, it was a bruising contest with little quality play and a tournament high 41 fouls.
A poor quality playing field hardly helped with both teams struggling to produce their best football on an uneven surface.
The first - and best - chance of a game of few opportunities came in the 35th minute when Uruguay striker Darwin Nunez had a clear header in front of goal but mis-timed his effort which flew wide off his shoulder.
Within moments, Brazil created an opening of their own with Raphinha breaking clear, but Uruguay keeper Sergio Rochet stayed tall and made a vital save.
Marcelo Bielsa's Uruguay were as tenacious as always, harrying Brazil in midfield and never afraid to interrupt their flow with a foul.
Brazil resorted too often to long balls forward but with only their 17-year-old talent Endrick, in for the suspended Vinicius Junior, as a central striker they lacked the physical presence to make that approach effective.
The game deteriorated the longer it went on with foul after foul, not deterred by lenient refereeing.
But Uruguay's hopes of wearing Brazil down were dealt a blow when Nandez hacked down Rodrygo with a dangerous slide into his ankle and after a VAR review the defender was sent off.
From then on it was clear that Uruguay were simply trying to make it to full-time and penalties and with no extra-time in Copa America, they were able to achieve their aim.
After Federico Valverde scored with the first spot kick, Eder Militao saw his effort saved by the diving Rochet.
When Douglas Luiz hit the post for Brazil, they trailed 3-1 and Jose Gimenez had the chance to clinch the game for Uruguay. His effort was superbly saved by Alisson Becker.
Substitute Gabriel Martinelli scored to keep Brazil alive but midfielder Manuel Ugarte kept his cool to drive home the decisive kick and send the 15-times Copa champions into the last four.
Bielsa praised his team's calmness in the shoot-out and their desire during the 90 minutes.
""I'm more seduced by attacking than defending, but I have to appreciate that in a tight game we created one more situation than our opponents, we defended well and we played 15 minutes with one less player, which at this level is a real factor,"" he said.
""If you ask me if I'm happy with having created three goal situations in 90 minutes, no, I'm not. But our opponents had two,"" he said.
""Today we outplayed Brazil in segments of the game and were outplayed in others,"" added the Argentine.
For Brazil the thoughts turn to the need to ensure they make it to the next World Cup after a poor start to CONMEBOL qualifying.
""We leave the tournament undefeated but not satisfied,"" said Dorival Junior whose team won once and drew twice in the group stage.
""We didn't play at a high level from a technical point of view, but I don't dismiss any of the games. I think there was commitment, fighting spirit. At no time did the team stop going for the result,"" he added.
""This process needs patience. We have two years to work before the World Cup. The first thing is to qualify for the World Cup because we are sixth in the (South American qualifiers) and it is a position that makes us uncomfortable,"" he said.
The tournament's final will be held in Miami on July 14.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/kenya-protests-expose-jet-setting-rutos-neglect-of-discontent-at-home-n344923,"How Kenya's protests exposed jet-setting Ruto's neglect of discontent at home
As he notched up dozens of foreign trips, however, citizens back home endured gruelling economic hardship.
Already hammered by a cost-of-living crisis and watching those in government enjoy the largesse derived from their positions, Kenyans forced Ruto to ditch plans to introduce eye-watering tax hikes after days of protests.
The U-turn has exposed the gulf between the image of Ruto as the jet-setting global voice not just of Kenya but the wider continent, and the grinding realities his nation faces - weighed down by debt, corruption and security threats.
It has left him severely weakened domestically with his administration divided in its response and his opponents rejuvenated, seeking to harness the wave of discontent ahead of elections in 2027, analysts and politicians said.
""Enslaved and supported by foreign interests, and never pro-people in its outlook and interests, (Ruto's administration) was bound to face the consequences of its priorities,"" Willy Mutunga, Kenya's former chief justice, told Reuters.
""As long as the material interests of the youth are not addressed, the chasm grows bigger and bigger,"" he said.
A spokesperson for Ruto did not respond to requests for comment.
Kenya - already one of Africa's biggest economies and strongest democracies – has in recent years expanded its global role.
On the eve of the climax of the protests, Ruto flagged off 400 policemen to lead a stabilisation force in Haiti.
The U.S. has designated Kenya as a major non-NATO ally, the first in sub-Saharan Africa, which gives it access to training and equipment but does not oblige it to join NATO operations.
Earlier this month, Ruto spoke at the G7 summit about the need to reform the global financial system to help the poor and has emerged as a powerful advocate for Africa in calls for action on climate change.
However, with protests erupting countrywide, including in Ruto's hometown, Eldoret, and louder calls for his departure, some analysts say his administration is fighting for survival.
Should Ruto dedicate more time and energy to addressing domestic concerns, Western powers risk losing the focus of one of their strongest allies in the battle for influence in Africa, where they seek to counter the growing power of Russia and China, diplomats and analysts said.
Ruto has offered dialogue to allay the fears of protesters but it is not clear if that will be accepted or who talks would be with.
He must also come up with a new plan to tackle Kenya's economic challenges, likely a hard sell due to the deficit cuts he will need to make to meet the conditions of international lenders for future funding.
""Even if nationwide demonstrations dissipate, this civil disobedience is a generation-defining moment,"" said Declan Galvin, managing director of Nairobi-based Exigent Risk Advisory, a consultancy.
""The next election is still several years away but Ruto clearly needs to shift his political position to address public needs for his own political survival.""
'BRAZEN ARROGANCE'
Ruto's has earned a reputation for a fierce work ethic but has struggled to shake an indictment by the International Criminal Court for his role in post-election violence in 2007-8 even after the court dropped the case.
Gabrielle Lynch, a Kenya expert at the University of Warwick in the UK, said that Ruto was ""an incredible performer"", able to roll out facts and figures for donors and then adapt his body language and tone for a local rally later the same day.
""It is as if presenting himself as a world leader would help legitimise him at home and remove tag of parochial instigator of violence,"" Lynch said.
Underscoring the scale of his globe-trotting, Ruto went on a total of 62 trips to 38 countries in his first 20 months in power, according to a tally by Kenya's Daily Nation newspaper.
But when home, Ruto has appeared tone deaf to complaints over the direction the country was taking, according to two sources in regular contact with his office.
Having campaigned as a champion of low-income ""hustlers"", Ruto's opponents have since given him the nickname ""Zakayo"", the Swahili name for a greedy tax collector in the Bible.
As protests mushroomed, videos of politicians flaunting their wealth circulated widely. Homes and businesses of parliamentarians who supported the tax hikes have been targeted.
Mutula Kilonzo Jr, a member of the opposition and governor of Makueni County, said the ""brazen arrogance"" of government officials fuelled discontent.
Anger has also been directed at the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), seen as the drivers of Ruto's fiscal policies. Since his climb-down on tax rises, Ruto must now find another path to make his nation's debt pile of some $80 billion, around 70% of GDP, more manageable.
IRON FIST, VELVET GLOVE
Kenya's relationship with the United States has deepened under Ruto's presidency but critics complain the mutual admiration has clouded Washington's view on Kenya's challenges.
U.S. support has been crucial in the fight against Islamist militants in Somalia and in May, Ruto enjoyed the first state visit to the U.S. by an African leader in over 15 years.
Ruto is seen as close to Meg Whitman, a former CEO at eBay and Hewlett Packard who is currently the U.S. ambassador to Kenya and the relationship has helped attract foreign investors, particularly U.S.-based tech firms, Nairobi-based diplomats say.
Boniface Mwangi, a prominent Kenyan social activist, said diplomatic statements of concern and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken calling Ruto after the violence was ""too little too late"" and Washington must now take a tougher line.
A U.S. State Department spokesperson said the the embassy in Nairobi had consistently called for restraint and the respect for constitutional rights.
Mwangi said that he advised the U.S. embassy last week to leverage their influence over the president to urge him to engage the protesters as the movement was swelling.
""People had to die for them say something,"" he said. ""They have bought this all shine and charming personality. They don't see the iron first behind the velvet glove.""

(Photo by SIMON MAINA / AFP)
Kenyan protest organisers called Wednesday for fresh peaceful marches against deeply unpopular tax hikes, as the death toll from nationwide demonstrations climbed to 22, a state-funded rights body said, vowing an investigation.
Tensions sharply escalated Tuesday, as police opened fire on demonstrators who stormed parliament, after the mainly youth-led rallies began mostly peacefully last week with thousands marching across the country against the tax increases.
The unprecedented scenes left parts of parliament ablaze and gutted and hundreds of people wounded, shocking Kenyans and prompting President William Ruto's government to deploy the military.
On Tuesday afternoon, parliament passed the contentious bill containing the tax hikes, which must be signed by Ruto to become law.
But demonstrators vowed to hit the streets again Thursday as they called for the bill to be scrapped.
""Tomorrow we march peacefully again as we wear white, for all our fallen people,"" protest organiser Hanifa Adan said on X.
""You cannot kill all of us.""
Demonstrators shared ""Tupatane Thursday"" (""we meet Thursday"" in Swahili), alongside the hashtag #Rejectfinancebill2024 on social media.
""The government does not care about us because they shot us with live bullets,"" Steve, 40, who was at the parliament Tuesday, told AFP.
Ruto ""victimised innocent people"", he said, adding he would march on Thursday: ""I expect more violence and chaos.""
Roseline Odede, chairwoman of the state-funded Kenya National Commission on Human Rights, said ""we have recorded 22 deaths"", adding that they would launch an investigation.
""This is the largest number of deaths (in) a single day protest,"" she said, adding that 19 people had died in the capital Nairobi.
""We have over 300 injured in our records and over 50 arrests,"" she added.
Earlier, Simon Kigondu, president of the Kenya Medical Association, said he had never before seen ""such level of violence against unarmed people.""
An official at Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi said Wednesday that medics were treating ""160 people... some of them with soft tissue injuries, some of them with bullet wounds"".
- 'Violence and anarchy' -
In posts online, protest organisers shared fundraising efforts to support those hurt in the demonstrations.
Ruto warned late Tuesday that his government would take a tough line against ""violence and anarchy"", likening some of the demonstrators to ""criminals"".
""It is not in order or even conceivable that criminals pretending to be peaceful protesters can reign terror against the people, their elected representatives and the institutions established under our constitution and expect to go scot-free,"" he said.
Shortly before his address, Defence Minister Aden Bare Duale announced that the army had been brought in to tackle ""the security emergency"" in the country.
A heavy police presence was deployed around parliament early on Wednesday, according to an AFP reporter, the smell of tear gas still in the air.
A policeman standing in front of the broken barricades to the complex told AFP he had watched the scenes unfold on TV.
""It was madness, we hope it will be calm today,"" he said.
- 'Didn't leave anything' -
In the central business district, where the protests have been concentrated, traders surveyed the damage.
""They didn't leave anything, just the boxes. I don't know how long it will take me to recover,"" James Ng'ang'a, whose electronics shop was looted, told AFP.
Ruto's administration has been taken by surprise by the intensity of opposition to its tax hikes.
And while the rallies -- mostly led by young, Gen-Z Kenyans -- have been largely peaceful, tensions rose sharply Tuesday afternoon when officers fired at crowds near parliament.
Demonstrators then breached parliament barricades, ransacking the partly ablaze complex, with local TV showing burnt furniture and smashed windows.
AFP journalists saw three people bleeding heavily and lying motionless on the ground.
The unrest has alarmed the international community, with more than 10 Western nations including the United States saying they were ""especially shocked by the scenes witnessed outside the Kenyan Parliament"".
Rights watchdogs have also accused the authorities of abducting protesters.
The police have not responded to AFP requests for comment.
Long-running grievances over the rising cost of living spiralled last week as lawmakers began debating the bill containing the tax hikes.
The cash-strapped government says the increases are needed to service the country's massive debt of some 10 trillion shillings ($78 billion), equal to roughly 70 percent of Kenya's GDP.
The treasury has warned of a gaping budget shortfall of 200 billion shillings, following Ruto's decision last week to roll back some of the most controversial tax hikes.
While Kenya is among East Africa's most dynamic economies, a third of its 52 million population live in poverty.

""From your own home in Sugoi, down the mountain, across the Coast, Kenyans are saying you go because you have failed as the president of the Republic of Kenya. Enough is enough. William Ruto you must resign as the president of the republic. You have failed the people of Kenya!"" added the Nairobi Senator.
He further condemned the excessive force used by police on unarmed youth who are protesting against the Finance Bill which is set to be assented into law by the President after approval by Parliament.
Sifuna told police to realise that the Kenyan youth are not their enemies.
“Your enemy is the one shipping you to Haiti, despite the position of the people of Kenya that we do not support the deployment of people to Haiti,” he said.
Sifuna claimed that the President is not paying the deployed police officers enough citing that he is pocketing 80% of the required funds.
The Nairobi Senator praised the Kenyan youth for the continuous protests against the finance bill, stating “Be afraid not. This is your country.""
""You will take this movement to its logical conclusion. We are here on standby if there is any need or requirement you need from us let us know and we will do it,” said Sifuna.
“We have seen goons raiding homes of innocent people at 2 am very ungodly hours. The ungodly president is raiding people’s homes at ungodly
hours. At 2 am they picked up Gabriel Oguda here at his house,” said Sifuna
“You must release Gabriel Oguda unconditionally and immediately and all the others who have been arrested or kidnapped by the police and goos working at the behest of William Ruto.""

https://www.citizen.digital/news/anti-finance-bill-demos-39-people-still-missing-amid-fears-of-police-abductions-killings-n344883,"Anti-Finance Bill demos: 39 people still missing amid fears of police abductions, killings
The Law Society of Kenya (LSK) and the Azimio
la Umoja One Kenya leadership have handed over a report on 39 missing persons
from the anti-Finance Bill 2024 protests to the Directorate of Criminal
Investigations (DCI).
LSK
and Azimio say they continue to receive reports from families of people who
participated in the protests and cannot be accounted for.
Several
people are still nursing injuries in different hospitals across the country
even as LSK vows to seek legal redress on behalf of all who have been affected.
At
the Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH), Citizen TV spoke to the family of
20-year-old Annex Kanyi from the Canaan area of Dandora in Nairobi; they had
gone to the facility for the third time to confirm whether he was one of the
victims nursing injuries after he failed to return home on Tuesday this
week.
He
participated in the anti-Finance Bill demos and has been missing since.
“Walikuwa
watano, wengine walirudi…yeye pekee yake hakurudi… tukiuliza Kanyi ako wapi
wanasema alienda maandamano,” said Kanyi's aunt Mama Njoroge.
The
family of Kanyi is one of the more than 30 families in distress after their kin
went missing during the protests.
“Kama
alikufa tujue kwenye ako kama ako jela tujue juu tunasumbuka bure na hatujui
ako wapi na hatujamuona na alitoka tu kwa nyumba vizuri, hakusema kwenye
ameenda, tumeambiwa na wengine ameenda maandamano,” she added.
Several
others are nursing injuries in different hospitals across the country.
The
LSK says it will represent victims of police brutality in court accusing the
government of using excessive force.
“We
just came to assure them and share our details that once they are discharged
they can come to the law society so that we can give the necessary legal
support that they may need. We also spoke to one lady who was shot by a stray
bullet on her way from work so she will also be coming to the law society so
that we can seek legal redress,” LSK President Faith Odhiambo noted.
In
Mombasa, a family is demanding justice after their kin, 23-year-old Ahmed
Mohammed, was hit by a stray bullet on his way home on Thursday.
In
Karambaini village, Kiambu County, emotions ran high as family and friends laid
to rest 21-year-old Evans Kiratu who died after a tear gas canister hit him on
his private parts a week ago during the protests.
The family
is demanding justice for their son who was the second confirmed fatality from
the protests.

AFC Leopards top scorer Victor Omune has remained non-committal on
his future at the Kenya Premier League club next season.
The Harambee Stars striker has declined to state whether he will
be donning ‘Ingwe’ colours in the 2024/25 season, after enduring a tough season
with no guaranteed first eleven spot in the line-up.
“That one I can’t confirm anything for now. Only God knows what
is at stake tomorrow and therefore nobody knows what tomorrow holds,” stated
Omune.
He added, “If I will be playing outside Kenya, inside Kenya or
AFC Leopards, I can’t assure you of anything. I think the time I am fit, people
have seen what I am capable of doing on the pitch, and therefore the important
thing maybe is to pray to God that I remain fully fit and injury-free next
season.”
Omune scored a total of nine goals for the premier league
heavyweights; eight in the league and one in the FKF Cup despite missing
several matches and occasionally being used as a substitute.
“I didn’t start the season as a starter. Even before the injury,
I was a substitute player.”
But maybe when I returned, it took time for me to regain
match-fitness. All in all the most important aspect here is the team’s
performance and results,” averred the soft-spoken forward.
Omune also attributed his lack of game time to injuries and
falling out of favour with head coach Tomas Trucha.
According to the former KCB attacking midfielder, despite the rough
ride last season, he is proud of the teamwork and the team spirit in the
Leopards cage.
“The season has not been bad but tough. We fought hard and
managed to finish in position five climbing all the way from the relegation spot,”
he said.
AFC Leopards finished fifth
on the log with 51 points, 21 behind winners and arch-rivals Gor Mahia.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/uproar-as-kenyans-expose-police-officer-who-shot-at-peaceful-crowd-n344845,"Uproar as Kenyans expose police officer who shot at peaceful crowd
The video shows the officer clad in a black cap, blue shirt and grey pants firing his gun at a crowd that was calmly standing watching him and his colleagues load arrested protesters into their van.
The shocking video which was originally posted on TikTok and shared across all other online platforms, highlights the brute force used by police officers during the anti-Finance Bill protests.
In the video shared by Brian Robin, the officer and his colleagues had detained several protestors inside the vehicle and were about to leave when the rogue officer decided to open fire on the crowd just for fun.
The video has since garnered over 200,000 views, with Kenyans calling for the police officer to be arrested and calling on the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) to probe the matter.
Further, Kenyans online shared personal details of the rogue officer including his name, phone number, wife's name, and the year he entered police service among others.
“It's another day that IPOA has done nothing about the rogue cop. I am so mad at bureaucracy because we've all seen the videos, the evidence but he's still roaming free. Imagine what he's doing in private.”
“We demand hasty arrest and detainment of the rogue cop. His acts are direct portrayal of a crime against humanity.”
“What was the reason?? Zero provocation nothing. He was just like let me shoot one more to add on my list,” read some of the comments online.
The conversation has brought questions about the use of officers, both uniformed and plain-clothed, who often camouflage in crowds to nab the protestors.
Section 1 of the National Police Service Act 2011 dictates that an officer shall always use non-violent means first and only use lethal force when non-violent means are ineffective.
Further, firearms or lethal force may only be used when less extreme measures have been inadequate and one is forced to act in self-defence or protect other people’s lives.
The Act also states that an officer intending to use firearms shall identify themselves and give clear warning of their intention to use firearms, with sufficient time for the warning to be observed, unless in circumstances where the officer’s life is at risk.
Following the protests, Human rights groups have since called out the government for extra-judicial killings, citing over 20 deaths and scores injured. This was contrary to President William Ruto’s statement, who alleged that six people died during the protests. He also denied the existence of extra-judicial killings since he took office.
@brianrobinmusic Fellow Kenyans, we know When, Where, Whom and How to vote, we just needed a little Why and now we have it. Do not fail to turn up on polls day because you don't like the presidential candidates on the ballot, we also need sane MPs, Governors, Senators, Women Reps and MCAs. I'm familiar with Ruto's words, I'm not convinced, I'm not buying it. If anything, we're more informed and united now more than ever. Whatever the chants say🤝 Video @artbeatpictures #rutomustgo #rejectfinancebill2024 ♬ original sound - Robin

The girl was playing with her friends in Kyang’ombe area on Thursday evening when the incident happened.
Residents expressed anger at the lack of maintenance of facilities, questioning why the manhole had been left open for a while and led to the death of the girl.
“The owner of the plot should have ensured his plot is well maintained. The child would be alive had the concerned persons taken precaution and sealed the manhole,” one local, who sought anonymity for fear of victimization, said.
He went on, “County officials are also to blame because they are supposed to inspect buildings to ensure they are habitable.”
The child’s body was taken to Shalom Hospital mortuary.
Kajiado East subcounty administrator Bruce Likama regretted the incident and said officers have launched a drive to inspect buildings to ensure they adhere to safety standards.
“We will be looking at things such as roofing, water pipes. waste on the road, failure to seal pipes and so on and take action against those flouting rules,” he said.

In a statement, KTDA cited Chebochok's involvement in a sex scandal exposed by the BBC titled Sex for work as the reason to resolve all concerns raised by stakeholders before the confirmation of the newly elected directors.
KTDA assured stakeholders that unethical behaviour would not be tolerated because it jeopardised the sector's progress.
""We call upon all our tea buyers, stakeholders, and partners to allow us to work with all the concerned players and authorities to resolve concerns raised regarding his nomination due to the legal and procedural complexities outlined above. We shall continuously update you on this since the process of confirming the Directors is yet to be completed,"" the statement read in part.
""KTDA has a zero-tolerance policy on gender-based violence, sexual harassment, corruption, and any other such unethical behavior and we condemn such acts that pose a great risk not only to Tegat Tea Factory Company but also to the entire tea sector in Kenya.""
The agency also distanced itself from overseeing the election of tea factory directors, explaining that the role was delegated to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC), which also cleared all candidates to run in the elections.
KTDA confirmed that it issued a statement on June 25th urging independent bodies to ensure that those cleared were not of questionable character or unethical behaviour.
""Each factory Company is an independent entity with its own memorandum and articles of association that stipulate how the directors' elections are to be done. He was elected by one of the six electoral areas of the factory on June 28, 2024 and the shareholders of the factory will have to make a final decision at a special general meeting on whether to accept him as a factory director or not.""
The KTDA's statement comes after Finlays and Lipton announced that they would stop purchasing the factory until the situation was resolved.
""LIPTON Teas and Infusions had been the largest buyer of tea from the Ainamoi zone. In light of these developments, we have immediately ceased purchasing from the Tegat/Toror factory and we are urging our industry partners to do the same until appropriate measures are taken to address this serious issue,"" Lipton said.
""Please be aware that we will not be able to continue to purchase tea from Toror Tea Factory while Mr. Chebochok holds the role of Director. We are monitoring this situation closely and trust you will take swift and decisive action on this matter. We look forward to receiving your urgent response,"" read a statement from Finlays.
Finlays reported 1,527 cases of sexual harassment among its employees over the previous five years in 2023. Ninety-two percent of this has been resolved, with the remaining cases still pending in court.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/revealed-billions-mcas-earn-as-monthly-sitting-allowances-n345277,"Revealed: Billions MCAs earn as monthly sitting allowances
County Assemblies spent Ksh.1.09 billion on MCAs sitting allowances during the first nine months of Financial Year 2023/24, a report by the Controller of Budget now shows.
Dated April
2024, the report highlights how the counties spent their allocated budget during the
reporting period. In the report, MCAs were allocated Ksh.2 billion but spent
Ksh.1 billion, translating to 54.4 per cent absorption rate.
In contrast,
the MCAs spent 43 per cent more than the previous financial year whereby
Ksh.716.57 million was spent.
According to the report, Baringo MCAs earned the highest amount as each member earned an average monthly sitting allowance of Ksh.162,843. The County was allocated Ksh.89 million sitting allowances in the budget and spent Ksh.65 million from it.
This was followed by 31 Embu MCAs who earned Ksh.145,827 each, Kakamega MCAs (Ksh.100,282) and Machakos (Ksh.87,651).
Nairobi MCAs were allocated Ksh.84 million allowances in their budget but used Ksh.34 million, translating to 41 per cent. Each MCA earned Ksh.31,247.
Kakamega
MCAs accounted for the highest budget allocation with Ksh.131 million whereby
each MCA earned Ksh.100,282. Turkana MCAs
received the lowest allowances with each MCA earning Ksh.19,667.
This comes
amid calls by the Kenyan youth for the Kenya Kwanza Administration to cut down
on cost and the
funds to be allocated to critical areas.
During a
roundtable discussion with the media, Ruto warned that the country will have to
borrow extra funds to recoup the amount that was to be raised by Finance Bill, 2024.
Kenyans have, however, stressed that the government should reduce the public wage bill among other expenses to reflect on the current state of affairs.

Published on: July 07, 2024 03:35 (EAT)
Spain's Carlos Alcaraz celebrates winning a point against Australia's Aleksander Vukic during their men's singles second round tennis match on the third day of the 2024 Wimbledon Championships at The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in Wimbledon, southwest London, on July 3, 2024. (Photo by ANDREJ ISAKOVIC / AFP)
Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz targets the Wimbledon quarter-finals on Sunday against a piano-playing Frenchman, while Emma Raducanu has British fans dreaming of a first home women's champion in 47 years.
Alcaraz, chasing a fourth Grand Slam title, is attempting to become just the sixth man to win the French Open and Wimbledon back-to-back.
After cruising through the first two rounds, the Spanish world number three twice trailed by a set before defeating Frances Tiafoe in the round of 32.
""I realise that I'm a good player in the fifth set,"" said the 21-year-old.
""I push the opponent just to be at his 100% physically and mentally, and play at his 100%. Sometimes for the other player it is difficult to keep at this kind of intensity.""
World number 16 Humbert is in the fourth round for the second time, five years after reaching the same stage.
Away from the courts, the left-handed French number one can be found playing the piano, a passion since he was five years old.
""I love music. I play a little bit of electric guitar, but I'm better at piano,"" he said
""When you play piano, you are only with you. It's great to have the time to be alone, to enjoy. In tennis, it's the opposite.""
Humbert is one of three Frenchmen to have made the last 16 at this year's Wimbledon.
Three years after her breakthrough summer when a run to the last 16 at Wimbledon was followed by an historic US Open title, Raducanu is making headlines again.
The British star, now ranked 135 after a depressing run of injuries, indifferent form and questionable coaching changes, finds herself with a potentially clear run to the semi-finals.
On Sunday, the 21-year-old faces Lulu Sun, the first New Zealand woman in the fourth round since 1959.
If she gets through that, a quarter-final date with either Paula Badosa or Donna Vekic awaits.
Raducanu's win over Maria Sakkari on Friday was just her second over a top 10 player -- both have come in the last two weeks.
""I'm just trying to cherish every moment I have here,"" said Raducanu.
On Saturday, Raducanu pulled out of the mixed doubles where she had been set to play alongside Andy Murray.
That decision meant Murray's All England Club career ended on a low note.
Judy Murray, the mother of the two-time Wimbledon champion, described Raducanu's decision as ""astonishing"".
However, she insisted Sunday that her comment was tongue-in-cheek and not a criticism of Raducanu, who had been slated to play with Murray in the last match on Saturday night.
""Not sure anyone understands sarcasm these days,"" Judy Murray wrote on X.
""Pretty sure the scheduling (4th match court 1 with a singles following day) will have played a major part in any decision making.""
Sun, a 123rd-ranked qualifier, had played and lost her only Grand Slam match before this Wimbledon.
The 23-year-old is guaranteed to earn at least $340,000 for her efforts -- more than she has made in her entire career.
Sun will also be headline news in her sleepy home town of Te Anau which she described as having ""more sheep and deer than people"".
Ben Shelton has made Wimbledon a family affair, reaching the fourth round 30 years after his father Bryan made the same stage.
""We're back, big dog,"" the 21-year-old American told his dad after seeing off Denis Shapovalov in the third round.
Back in 1994, Bryan Shelton stunned former champion Michael Stich in the first round before eventually being knocked out by Sweden's Christian Bergstrom.
On Sunday, the 14th-ranked Shelton takes on world number one and Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner for a place in the quarter-finals.
Shelton defeated the Italian in their first meeting at Shanghai in 2023 before Sinner came out on top in Vienna later that season and at Indian Wells earlier this year.
US Open champion Coco Gauff, who made her breakthrough as a 15-year-old at Wimbledon in 2019, takes on American compatriot Emma Navarro.
Gauff, the world number two, has dropped just 10 games in three rounds so far.

Published on: June 25, 2024 12:50 (EAT)
A family from Mahola-Ulawe village in Alego/Usonga sub-county is living in agony following the mysterious disappearance of their 12-year-old kin who went missing three weeks ago.
Angelina Atieno Onyango said that her grandson, Fidel Onyango Ouma, who is a grade six pupil at Mahola primary school, left home on May 30 and his whereabouts are unknown to date.
She said the last time he was seen, Ouma was leaving his uncle’s home.
He left on a bicycle, carrying his school bag but never returned and efforts to trace his whereabouts have been futile.
Fidel’s uncle, Tobias Omondi Obunde, said Ouma had asked for permission from school to seek medication over a mild headache, but was only at home briefly.
The family started getting concerned when Ouma hadn’t returned home by evening.
A search was launched, but it yielded no fruit.
The family is now appealing to members of the public who may know about Ouma’s whereabouts to report to the nearest police station.

In Ghana, for instance, a Member of Parliament stood to make a point at the Ghanaian parliament, urging his colleagues to tread carefully lest they find themselves in the same rough waters their Kenyan counterparts experienced on June 25.
While addressing the country's deputy minister for Information, the member of parliament urged his colleague to comment on the Kenyan protests which saw angered protesters storm Parliament, plunging MPs into panic.
""He should have taken the opportunity to brief the House on what he saw in Kenya. The Kenyan public are beating up Members of Parliament for passing bad laws. Mr Speaker, it is a serious matter. I saw colleagues Members of Parliament beaten to a pulp,"" he said.
Amid what appears to be murmurs and interjections from the House speaker, the MP pushed on, urging his colleagues to take the matter seriously as it was not something to be laughed about.
""Mr Speaker, advise us on how to pass good laws to avoid being beaten by the public. We should be worried. It is not a laughing matter. It is not a joke,"" he reiterated.
The MP further emphasized the need for Ghanaian legislators to prioritize public opinion and enact fair laws to prevent the kind of backlash experienced in Kenya.
Even after the Speaker told him that the point was a 'sideline issue', he pressed on, saying, ""It's serious. I saw one running and the police ushering him through a tunnel to escape.""
In June 25, thousands of protesters breached Parliament security, pouring into the legislative house, causing massive havoc, vandalising critical material, wiping the cafeteria clean and even brazenly occupying parliamentary seats.
Reacting to the Ghanaian MPs statement, veteran journalist Beatrice Marshall said, ""Kenyan MPs, you're not an example and a laughing stock in Africa.""
One Nigerian said, ""I hope you are all taking notes because serious beating is around the corner starting with Edo State elections on the 21st of September.""
On his part, journalist Saddique Shaban said, ""Wake up @SaddickAdams. We have passed over the mandate to you in the West Coast of Africa. You're the Land of the Black Stars, make Kwame Nkuruma proud.""
Ghanaian X personality Blessing Aboagye also weighed in, saying, ""Ghanaians are cowards. I doubt we can pull off what we saw in Kenya. People are too docile here. I don't see change happening soon.""
The anti-Finance Bill protests have now quickly morphed into #RutoMustGo protests as Kenyans continue to pour into the streets across the country all calling for the President's resignation.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/embattled-biden-greets-nato-allies-in-washington-n345530,"Embattled Biden greets NATO allies in Washington
U.S. President Joe Biden welcomes the heads of NATO member states to Washington on Tuesday for an annual summit that gives the embattled Democrat an international stage to convince allies at home and abroad he can still lead.
Biden, 81, has vowed to press on in his race against Republican Donald Trump, 78, despite concern from Democrats on Capitol Hill and donors that he will lose the Nov. 5 election after a halting debate performance on June 27.
Biden made restoring the United States' traditional alliances abroad to counter the threat of autocracies the centerpiece of his foreign policy after Trump challenged allies as part of an ""America First"" approach. Who wins in November could have a substantial impact on NATO's and Europe's future.
Trump has suggested that, given a second term, he would not defend NATO members that did not meet the alliance's defense spending target of 2% of their respective GDP if they came under military attack.
He has also questioned the amount of aid given to Ukraine in its battle against Russia's invasion.
Aides said Biden's opening speech expected at 5 p.m. Eastern time (2100 GMT) will highlight what his administration sees as a key accomplishment: a stronger and more united NATO, under Washington's leadership, with more members and a resolve to meet their collective security needs.
That brings, they say, tangible results for American voters: a safer country, with a strong international economic position, more alliances and power abroad, and less at risk of conflict with its adversaries.
The mere presence of leaders from NATO and beyond shows Biden's power to assemble coalitions and inspire confidence, Kirby said, arguments that Trump and many of his Republican allies reject.
""Republicans, of course, celebrate the peace and prosperity that NATO has secured and will continue to stand by our partners as we prevent needless wars,"" said U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, a top Republican and Trump ally, on Monday. ""But we also believe that NATO needs to be doing more.""
WORRY FROM ALLIES ABOUT BIDEN'S STAYING POWER
NATO, celebrating its 75th anniversary, has found new purpose in opposing Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion and welcomed Finland and Sweden as new members.
The grinding Ukraine-Russia war will dominate private conversations between the leaders of the 32 NATO member countries, who have a full agenda focused on military and financial aid for Ukraine and offering some pathway toward eventual NATO membership for Kyiv.
But those leaders, already anxious about the prospect of Trump's return, come to Washington with fresh concern about Biden's staying power, according to diplomats from their countries.
One described Biden as bruised after a difficult political period and said their government was looking for signs about whether he would survive.
Joern Fleck, senior director of the Europe Center at the Atlantic Council, said questions about Biden's survival were ""absolutely on everyone's minds"" and raised the prospect that Trump could win the U.S. election and weaken the alliance.
NATO leaders face political uncertainty in Europe, with paralysis looming in France after gains for left and far right parties, and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's coalition weakened after a poor showing in European Parliament elections.
The week's events in Washington will give Biden a chance to address the concerns, including a high profile speech on Tuesday and a rare solo press conference on Thursday.
Biden will also highlight new support for Ukraine. During the summit, NATO leaders are expected to endorse an initiative that will see the alliance coordinate arms supplies and training for Ukrainian forces fighting Russia's invasion. They may also get more support on air defense.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy will attend the summit and meet with Biden. He is due to deliver an address on Tuesday evening at the Ronald Reagan Institute in Washington.
Ruslan Stefanchuk, speaker of Ukraine's parliament, met with U.S. lawmakers and representatives of legislatures of other NATO states on Tuesday and decried Monday's attack on a children's hospital in Kyiv and called for more air defense systems, aircraft and long-range artillery.
Ukraine ultimately wants to join NATO to ward against further future attacks by Russia, but candidates have to be approved by all of the alliance's members, some of which are wary of provoking a direct war with Russia.
Moscow sees NATO as a vehicle for U.S. dominance and has accused the alliance of returning to a Cold War mindset.
U.S. officials have said the summit will offer Ukraine a ""bridge to membership,"" which would include the new NATO effort to coordinate arms supplies and training.
Some members want the alliance to make clear Ukraine is moving toward NATO ""irreversibly"" and are keen for language in a statement emerging from the summit to move beyond the alliance's pledge last year that ""Ukraine's future is in NATO.""

https://www.citizen.digital/news/inside-the-iebc-act-that-paves-way-for-hiring-of-new-electoral-commission-n345563,"Inside the IEBC Act that paves way for hiring of new electoral commission
Protesters in recent anti-tax demonstrations demanded the reconstitution of the IEBC to pave way for the hiring of new commissioners and recall of incompetent legislators.
Heeding the calls, President William Ruto on Tuesday assented to the IEBC (Amendment) Bill which paves the way for establishment of the selection panel for the appointment of new IEBC commissioners.
President Ruto said new commissioners should uphold the electoral body’s mandate of ensuring elections are managed transparently and administered in an impartial, efficient, neutral, accurate and accountable manner.
“I concur with leaders who have said there must be professionalism and integrity as part of the cardinal principles of the men and women who will be charged with overseeing our elections,” he said.
The IEBC bill was the first to be processed by Parliament based on the recommendations of the National Dialogue Committee (NADCO) report tabled by a 10-member delegation after a disputed 2022 presidential election results which saw a section of the IEBC commissioners disown Ruto’s election victory.
The IEBC Act now requires any individual seeking to be an IEBC commissioner to possess proven knowledge and at least ten years’ of experience.
Aspiring commissioners will also require experience in Information and Communication Technology or accounting to bolster the Commission's efficiency and effectiveness.
Under the new law, members of the selection panel have been increased from seven to nine to accommodate a cast representation of stakeholders and interest groups.
The selection panel will include 2 persons nominated by the Parliamentary Service Commission (PSC); one representing the majority party and another from the minority party.
It will also have three persons nominated by the Political Parties Liason Committee; one not from a parliamentary party.
It will also include one person nominated by the Law Society of Kenya (LSK) and one nominated by the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Kenya.
Two other persons will be nominated by the Inter-Religious Council of Kenya.
The Commission will also, after every general election, be required to review its operations and make the necessary changes required to make its operations more efficient, effective, transparent and accountable.
Secretary
to the Commission shall also hold office for a term of three years and may be
eligible for re-appointment for one further term of three years.
""The review shall be completed within one year after every general election and the Commission shall publish the report in the Gazette and submit the report to Parliament,"" reads the law in part.
Opposition
leader Raila Odinga Odinga
said the Act comes at a time when Kenya is at a crossroads as a result of
deadly nationwide protests against taxation and President Ruto’s
leadership.
“Most
of the issues being raised by the youth today are contained in the NADCO
report. If it is implemented fully, it will address all the issues Kenyan youth
have raised,” said the former Prime Minister.
He
called for a wider engagement beyond committees such as NADCO for Kenyans to
“vomit all that is in their chests” to the government.
The
new law will now see President Ruto appointing members of the selection panel
which will select its chairperson from its members in its first sitting.
New
applications will then be invited within seven days of the panel's appointment and
shortlisting will later follow for interviews.
""The
chairperson of the Commission shall be a person who is qualified to hold the
office of judge of the Supreme Court under the Constitution,"" reads the
law.
Within
90 days the panel will be needed to forward two names for the chairperson
position and 9 others for the commissioner positions and thereafter the panel
will stand dissolved.
The
names will be forwarded to Ruto who will select one chairperson and six
commissioners.
After selection, he will forward the names to the National Assembly for approval and if a greenlight is given the names will be returned to Ruto for appointment.
The Act might now allow for the recall of MPs who have been put under the public's microscope on competence.

On Citizen TV Daybreak, Koech was grilled to elucidate on why he boldly condemns leaders brandishing money in public yet he was seen doing the same.
Koech argued that the money, Ksh.3 million, was an award in a football tournament organized by Senate Majority leader Aaron Cheruiyot and he was just handing over the money, which he says he was not supposed to in the first place.
The legislator noted that the money was to be handed over to the winning team by Senate Speaker Amason Kingi but he was forced to leave after bad weather.
""This was Senator Aaron Cheruiyot's tournament. My only mistake was to hand over the price to the people who had won the tournament. It is not my money you can see the t-shirt is written Cheruiyot,"" he said.
""In fact Honourable Kingi was going to do it but because he had flown in there and the weather was getting bad, he had to leave and I was given the money to hand over.""
Koech further argued that the money was not fraudulently acquired, noting that it was donated by friends and partners who organized the tournament.
He noted the annual tournament is sponsored by Cheruiyot and the prize money is always Ksh.3 million for the top team.
""This is a collection. He collects from friends, and corporate institutions to support the young people and he has this football tournament for young people,"" said Koech.
""I am very disappointed with the people who were in this tournament because they should have come out to defend Cheruiyot and myself from that lynching.""
Koech's defense comes amid public uproar on legislators flaunting money online whose sources have been put to question.
In the past few months, leaders have been conducting harambees where they donate ridiculous amounts of money including Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi who was seen donating Ksh.20 million.

The United Democratic Alliance (UDA) party Nominated MP Jackson Kosgei has narrated the events that unfolded after he was left behind in the National Assembly during demonstrations when Kenyan youth stormed Parliament in protest over Finance Bill, 2024.
He explained
that the chaos ensued after the lawmakers had passed the Bill in the morning
session and the Appropriations Bill in the afternoon.
Kosgei
pointed out that the opposition Azimio la Umoja One Kenya MPs had
stormed out of Parliament in protest against the majority vote for the Bill and
declared that they would join the protestors who were engaging police in
running battles in Nairobi’s CBD.
The
legislator claimed that shortly after passing the Appropriations Bill, the MPs
heard a commotion as protestors stormed the gates and walked in large numbers
towards the building.
Kosgei, who
is in a wheelchair, found himself in an unfortunate situation as other MPs ran
towards the evacuation route, leaving him behind to the mercy of the protesters.
The MP was
unable to escape on time and was unsure of how he would face the protestors as
he was among the 195 MPs who voted ‘Yes’ to pass the since withdrawn contentious
Bill.
“Unfortunately,
where there is an evacuation route is not friendly to wheelchair users like
myself. It was getting worse and my colleague Rose Museu, who was using
crutches, and I decided to face the protesters. We were at the private members
lounge,” Kosgei told The Standard newspaper.
Kosgei
detailed that the protesters stumbled upon him but were kind to him as they
requested to escort him out of the building.
“They came
in and saw us. They knew who I am and even knew how I had voted. But they told
me that I was a good man and asked me to allow them to escort me out of the
building. They said what would happen might not be good for me,” he noted.
He noted
that the youth engaged him in productive conversations on why they rejected the
Bill, citing overtaxation on Kenyans despite the high cost of living.
A video was
shared online showing protestors wheeling Kosgei out of the building while
chanting.
“I thank you
for saving my life and that of Rose Museu when everybody was running for their
lives, and rightly so. I appreciate that even in the moment of anger and
stress, they still had humanity in them,” he noted.

According to the Supplementary Order Paper slated for Wednesday, June 26, the action will be in line with Article 241 of the Constitution which requires approval from Parliament before deployment of KDF is enacted.
The motion was forwarded to Parliament after a request was issued by the Defence Council on Wednesday.
""THAT, pursuant to Article 241(3)(c) of the Constitution and sections 31(1)(b), 31(1)(c) and 32 of the Kenya Defence Forces Act, Cap. 199, this House accedes to the request of the Defence Council dated 26th June 2024 and, in the interest of national security, APPROVES the deployment of the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) in support of the National Police Service in various parts of the Republic of Kenya affected by ongoing violent protests that have caused destruction to critical infrastructure until normalcy is restored,"" the notice reads in part.
Further, Parliament has resolved to break for recess on Wednesday and resume regular sittings on Tuesday, July 23 at 2:30 pm.
This follows Tuesday's #OccupyParliament protests that saw youth storm the House and wreak havoc during the demonstrations.
The ceremonial mace, which symbolizes the authority of the legislature, was stolen, some parts of the parliament building vandalised and a section of it set on fire.
The protestors have vowed to continue with the protests with a plan dubbed #OccuptyStateHouse set to be carried out on Thursday.
Speaker Moses Wetangula had initially approved the motion for the House to break for a two-week recess beginning Friday.

Following are historical highlights of a movement that has been dominated by the Le Pen family for more than half a century.
1972
Former soldier Jean-Marie Le Pen founds the National Front, a fringe far-right party comprised of veterans from the Algerian war and French collaborators from the Vichy regime.
1974
Le Pen runs in the presidential election, but garners less than 1% of the vote. Two years later, his home in Paris is attacked with a bomb. No culprit is ever found.
1981
Le Pen is unable to secure enough backers to run for the presidential election, won by leftist François Mitterrand. In the following years, Le Pen gradually attracts new supporters.
1986
The party wins its first seats in the National Assembly.
1987
Le Pen makes disparaging comments about gay men with AIDS, part of a lifelong tendency to spark outrage with racist, antisemitic and homophobic slurs that often land him in legal jeopardy but which win support among a part of the electorate.
1988
Le Pen wins 14.4% of votes in the presidential election. The following year, the National Front wins more than 10% of votes in European elections. It also begins to zero in on Islam and Muslim immigrants as one of its major political concerns.
1995
The National Front wins three city halls in the south, Toulon, Orange and Marignane, underlining its growing electoral support.
2002
Le Pen runs for president and wins 16.86% of votes, enough to put him into a second-round run-off against Jacques Chirac. The strong showing sends shockwaves through France and there is widespread disgust that such a far-right party could do so well. Politicians from the right and left come together to prevent Le Pen from winning the second round. Chirac wins over 80% of votes in the run-off.
2008
A court hands Le Pen a three-month suspended prison sentence and a fine of 10,000 euros for saying the Nazi occupation of France was ""not particularly inhumane"".
2011
Le Pen's daughter Marine Le Pen becomes the new leader of the National Front after a period in which the party performs badly in polls and faces growing financial pressures.
2012
Marine Le Pen makes a first, unsuccessful run for the presidency.
2014
The National Front has a breakthrough election year, winning control of 11 town halls and also taking first place in European Parliament elections.
2015
Jean Marie Le Pen is suspended from the party after describing the Holocaust as ""a detail"" of World War Two. That same year, he is expelled by his daughter from the party.
2017
Marine Le Pen runs for the presidency again, but loses to Emmanuel Macron. After that she increases efforts to make the party more palatable to a wider electorate, seeking to distance it from its racist and antisemitic past, and also give its lawmakers a more professional veneer, with media training and a slick social media presence. In 2018, she changes the party's name to National Rally (RN).
2022
Jordan Bardella, a 28-year-old protege of Marine Le Pen, is chosen to be the new chairman of the RN.
June 2024
Bardella leads the party in the European Parliament elections, handing out a drubbing to Macron's party and prompting the president to call a snap legislative vote. Bardella is the RN's prime ministerial candidate.
In the June 30 first round of the French parliamentary elections, the RN finishes top with 33% of the national vote.

Former Migori Governor Okoth Obado and his
four children — Dan Achola Okoth, Scarlet Susan Okoth, Everlyn Zachary Okoth, and
Jerry Zachary Okoth — along with 11 other accused persons, appeared at the Milimani
anti-corruption court on Monday.
The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC)
presented evidence against the suspects over criminal charges of embezzlement
and conflict of interest in the Migori county government.
Investigating officer Robert Rono detailed
in court how Obado’s close associates used proxy companies and attempted to
close seven bank accounts that may have been used in the embezzlement.
The latest development comes amid uproar
from the public over an out-of-court settlement between EACC and Obado, where
he agreed to forfeit properties worth Ksh.235 million.
According to the EACC, although initial
investigations into payments made by the county following allegations of
suspicious payments showed a possible loss of Ksh.1.98 billion by the Migori
county government, subsequent findings revealed that most payments were
legitimate, as some of the executed contracts were verified during an audit.
The findings established that Ksh.235
million remained unexplained and suspected to have been fraudulently acquired
from the county government.
The unexplained funds included kickbacks
sent to foreign universities as school fees for Obado’s children and high-value
properties purchased for the family by implicated contractors.
These assets including prime property and
two vehicles were forfeited to the EACC and are set to be auctioned.
Obado's trial was deferred to Tuesday to
allow the prosecution to serve documents to the defence.
If found guilty, the suspects face
convictions under Section 48 of the Anti-corruption and Economic Crimes Act,
2003, which mandates a maximum jail term of 10 years per offence, alongside
other significant penalties, including a 10-year ban on holding public office,
as stipulated by law.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/lsk-boss-faith-odhiambo-speaks-on-abduction-torture-of-protesters-and-threats-to-her-life-n345149,"LSK boss Faith Odhiambo speaks on abduction, torture of protesters and threats to her life
Every day for the past three weeks, the Law
Society of Kenya (LSK) President Faith Odhiambo’s phone has been ringing off
the hook.
She wakes up to alerts and cries for help
from Kenyans illegally arrested and tortured, and families whose kin have had
their lives cut short during what began as peaceful protests against the
punitive Finance Bill, 2024, but have now morphed into anti-government
demonstrations.
Ms. Odhiambo spoke exclusively to Citizen
Digital about the protests, subsequent abductions, torture and the multiple
extra-judicial killings that have occurred amidst the largely peaceful demos.
Finance Bill, 2024 sparked widespread anger
among Kenyans, leading to protests majorly led by the country’s younger
population, referred to as Gen Z.
After weeks of mobilisation that was majorly
done online, the youth finally took to the streets across the country to oppose
the Bill in totality, with their irreducible minimum being; ‘Reject, Not
Amend!’
“I understood how heavy this Finance Bill was
going to be, I had seen the complaints online but I did not think it will get
to the magnitude of what we witnessed. So when it happened, my first thought
was ‘how can I help?’” Ms. Odhiambo told Citizen Digital Reporter Ann Nyathira.
The LSK boss emerged as a key advocate for
those oppressed, and quickly took on the role of representing Kenyans who were
arrested illegally by police, thereby becoming a hero to many of the prostests
who went ahead to christen her ‘The People’s Chief Justice.’
She went ahead and called on her fellow colleagues
to assist and ensure police conduct during the demos was monitored. Their
mission was to ensure people are allowed to peacefully picket without
harassment, arrest or trumped up charges.
“During this time, particularly, I felt the
biggest contribution that the legal profession can give with regards to all
those who were on the streets was to give legal assistance,” noted Ms. Odhiambo.
As she visited different police stations and
worked tirelessly to trace Kenyans who were abducted, Ms. Odhiambo was faced
with the fear and a painful reminder that Kenya could have been heading back to
the almost forgotten dark days of the Nyayo regime.
The extrajudicial killings in different parts
of the country starkly illustrated how decades of reforms could be lost, with
the advocate expressing deep concern for her own security amidst her advocacy
efforts.
“This was the day I was first tear gassed; they
initially refused to allow advocates to access people who had been arrested. They
arrested people who were armed with their phones, bottles of water and some
with vuvuzela. What has kept me going despite the fatigue is the goodwill
messages from Kenyans.” she narrated.
“People say when you are in trouble call
Faith, but we still have safety concerns; some of my council members have had
to go into safety houses for a while. It just takes courage, we have had
incidences where armed people came after us and I have been stalked around for
a while. One of our officers who mans our toll free line almost got attacked in
the middle of the night, luckily the authorities arrived on time and the perpetrators
ran away.”
According to Ms. Odhiambo, Kenyans who were thought
to have organised and moblised the protests were abducted and interrogated on
issues regarding the demos in isolation, with some of them even intimidated into
silence using threats on their families.
“Some had their private parts pressed and
hurt. These are things that happened during the Moi days. We will represent all
the victims and ensure the people involved are accountable and they get the
justice they deserve,” she noted.
Looking forward, the lawyers’ body boss
believes that the Head of State together with the State agencies must be held to
account and must follow the law that governs the country.
“The Head of State, the Inspector General of
Police, officers that were leading some of these battalions and the shooters
that were identified and those that were not must be held accountable and
command responsibilities,” she said.
“As for the shooters, they can be identified
by ballistics and I hope we can get an independent international body to offer
ballistics services because the same police who are perpetrators cannot investigate
themselves.”
She called on the President to listen to
Kenyans and their demands, further urging him to empathise with the parents who
painfully lost their children.
So how does the country move forward from
here?
According to Ms. Odhiambo, Kenyans now have a
powerful opportunity to demand for a better nation.
“We cannot achieve reconciliation and peace
without justice. To bring back the nation as a whole, the President needs to
ensure he holds relevant persons accountable, take measures to stop ongoing
corruption and ensure accused people are brought to book,” she said.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/sierra-leone-outlaws-child-marriage-with-new-bill-n345092,"Sierra Leone outlaws child marriage with new bill
Advocates hope the new legislation will better protect girls in Sierra Leone, around a third of whom are married before they turn 18, increasing the maternal death rate due to the physical risks they face from pregnancy, according to the health ministry.
Under the law, any man who marries a girl under the age of 18 could face at least 15 years in prison and a fine of around $4,000.
Parents or those attending such marriage ceremonies could also face fines.
The U.S. Bureau of African Affairs welcomed the passage of the bill as a ""significant milestone (that) not only protects girls but promotes robust human rights protections.""
West and Central Africa has the highest prevalence of child marriage in the world and is home to nearly 60 million child brides, according to the U.N. children's agency UNICEF.
A 21-year-old Sierra Leonean former child bride, who requested anonymity, told Reuters that she was forced into marriage at the age of 14 and was considering going to court since the new law would allow her to file for an annulment.
The legislation should ""break the cycle of early marriage and its devastating consequences,"" said Human Rights Watch researcher Betty Kabari. ""It also sets a pathway forward for other African nations, such as Tanzania and Zambia, to revoke laws that permit child marriage.""

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/england-euros-semi-against-dutch-a-premier-league-style-clash-n345446,"England Euros semi against Dutch a 'Premier League style' clash
Netherlands defender Micky van de Ven expects the Euro 2024
semi-final against England on Wednesday to be a Premier League-type clash.
The Tottenham centre-back is one of several Dutch players who play
in England, along with Liverpool duo Virgil van Dijk and Cody Gakpo, among others.
England's matches have been slow-paced, largely dull affairs this
summer but the meeting with the Dutch in Dortmund could produce a higher-octane
duel.
""I think so,"" Van de Ven told reporters Monday when
asked if he anticipated a Premier League-style affair.
""If you see the quality of players from both teams, you can
expect the rhythm and level of the game will be really high.
""Hopefully it's us that have more of the ball than England,
so it's more England that's running, but I expect a high-intensity game.""
Gakpo said the Dutch would try to stop Real Madrid midfielder Jude
Bellingham from deciding the game.
The 21-year-old scored a brilliant overhead kick against Slovakia
in the last 16 to save England when they were on the verge of elimination.
""Obviously he's having a very, very good season, he's a
world-class player and he made a fantastic goal,"" said Gakpo.
""He's a player we need to watch, but I think they have more
players we need to watch (too), they have a very good team with very good
players, but we have a very good team as well.""
England reached the semi-finals by defeating Switzerland 5-3 on
penalties after a goalless draw and Gakpo noted the quality of the Three Lions'
spot-kicks.
""Their penalties were very good, but if you see the players
who took them, quality players, some of them take penalties for their
clubs,"" added the left-winger, who is joint top scorer at this Euros with
three goals.
""I was impressed but not surprised. The quality is there and
we know they are very good when it comes to penalties.
""Hopefully if (the semi-final) comes to penalties we will
win.""
The Netherlands reached their first Euros semi-final since 2004 by
coming from behind to beat Turkey 2-1 on Saturday, building on reaching the
World Cup quarter-final in Qatar two years ago.
""We
are a step further than the previous tournament and I am happy that I can be
part of this too,"" added Gakpo.

https://www.citizen.digital/citizen-originals/samuel-mbeche-my-intriguing-ride-from-nairobi-to-south-africa-to-promote-eyecare-n345441,"Samuel Mbeche: My intriguing ride from Nairobi to South Africa to promote eyecare
In May 2024, Mbeche embarked on a solo ride from Nairobi to South Africa, with a sole aim of creating awareness on eyecare.
The optometrist notes that eyecare is often given less attention, proven to the fact that only a handful of medical students specialize on the eye, and a number of public health facilities lack professionals to attend to eyes.
“Growing up in a rural area, I saw a lot of people struggling with eyecare. In High Schho, I was playing rugby and got an eye injury. I got a very shoddy treatment since there was no specialist for eyecare. From there I realized there was a gap,” Mbeche recalls the origin of his passion.
During his adventure ride to South Africa, Mbeche cruised through 10 African countries in 22 days.
Armed with personal effects, a tight budget and a map, he made stops in villages to interact with natives and create awareness on eyecare.
“I only took one day break.”
Mbeche notes that he had a smooth journey within East African borders, but experienced immigration hurdles in the other countries.
“The toughest border to cross was Zambia. They have a lot of taxes like carbon tax, eco levy, Interpol charges…that I did not anticipate when starting the journey,” Mbeche notes.
Through Zimbabwe, Malawi, Mozambique, Lesotho, the adventure rider met communities with different cultures, talking different languages.
The optometrist dreams of doing another round trip across Africa as he advocates for attention to eyecare.
Mbeche remarks that eyes should be given equal attention, just like other body parts with complications.
“We have had opticians who just dispense spectacles. But the eyes are linked to the body, sometimes you have a bacteria or virus which manifests in the eye. We have to get more people being trained,” he advocates.
His vision is to see prioritization of eyecare services and creating awareness among the Kenyan population.
“Cataracts, Glaucoma are dangerous eye conditions. Glaucoma is a silent thief of sight. You can just lose your vision without noticing.”

Published on: July 05, 2024 02:40 (EAT)
England's manager Gareth Southgate congratulates England's midfielder #23 Adam Wharton after the International friendly football match between England and Bosnia-Herzegovina at St James' Park in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, north east England on June 3, 2024. England won the match 3-0. (Photo by Paul ELLIS / AFP)
Saved by a dramatic late fightback to beat Slovakia, Gareth Southgate will take charge of England for the 100th time in Saturday's Euro 2024 quarter-final against Switzerland under pressure to tear up his tactical plan.
The Three Lions have stumbled their way through to the last eight, winning just one of their four games within 90 minutes, and a star-studded squad who thrive when playing for their clubs has so far failed to deliver.
Yet history could still beckon for Southgate's men in Germany.
England are the highest ranked side left on the 'soft' side of the draw with Turkey or the Netherlands waiting in the semi-finals should they manage to defeat the Swiss in Duesseldorf.
Switzerland, who cruised past holders Italy 2-0 in the last 16 and held Germany 1-1 in the group stages, promise to be a step up from anything England have faced at the tournament so far.
Failure to change tack is likely to see Southgate bow out as England boss at a century of matches and invite a tidal wave of criticism for failing to make the most of the talent at his disposal.
He has already been targeted at this tournament with thrown beer cups after a dull 0-0 draw with Slovenia in the group stages.
Southgate has so far stuck to his guns with 10 of the same 11 starting all four matches.
There will be one enforced change to face the Swiss as defender Marc Guehi is suspended.
But it is further forward that Southgate faces bigger challenges to correct England's imbalance.
Any questions over Jude Bellingham's role as a number 10 appear to have been wiped away by his stunning overhead kick deep into stoppage time against Slovakia to keep England alive.
- Foden 'sorry' for Southgate -
However, Bellingham's position as the creative hub of the team does cause Southgate other issues.
Phil Foden, who picked up Premier League player of the year awards for his starring role in Manchester City's title triumph this season, has looked out of sorts shunted out to the left to accommodate the Real Madrid man.
Meanwhile, there is little threat down England's left as Foden has drifted inside and Southgate's decision not to take a fit natural left-back, with Luke Shaw battling back from injury, has proved misguided.
“I feel sorry for Gareth,"" Foden told reporters this week. ""We (the players) have to be leaders. In games we could have got together a little bit more and worked out a solution.""
Southgate also admitted after the Slovakia match that both his goalscorers, Bellingham and Harry Kane, were physically exhausted 15 minutes from the end but were kept on for the one moment of magic they can produce.
Bar a Bellingham exhibition for the first half of a 1-0 win over Serbia in England's opening game, both have been far from their best but are undroppable in the eyes of their manager.
Instead, Southgate is reportedly looking at switching to a back three, which served him well in reaching the 2018 World Cup semi-finals and the final at Euro 2020.
That would allow both Foden and Bellingham to play centrally, behind Kane, but runs the risk of still leaving England to easy to play against without natural width.
John Stones said he hoped the second chance offered by the Slovakia fightback will act as a ""turning point emotionally"" for a squad trying to find their mojo.
""It's time for us to realise where we are and the magnitude of what we can achieve and put that into practice,"" added the Manchester City defender.
Bellingham's memorable goal in Gelsenkirchen stopped the rot and all will be forgotten and forgiven should England emerge victorious in Berlin on July 14.
On the other hand, if they are instead on a plane home on Sunday morning, Euro 2024 will be a stain on Southgate's legacy after eight years as England boss.

At least 87 people were feared dead in a stampede at a Hindu religious gathering in India's northern state of Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday, broadcaster NDTV reported.
The stampede happened in a village in Hathras district, about 200 km southeast of the national capital New Delhi, where authorities said a large crowd had gathered on an area of open ground in response to a call from a local religious leader.
District police spokesperson Manish Chikara put the death toll at about 60 people, but said that figure may rise.
Videos on social media showed bodies piled up on the ground outside a local hospital. Reuters could not immediately verify the images.
""The incident happened due to overcrowding at the time when people were trying to leave the venue,"" Hathras district administrator Ashish Kumar told reporters.
An unidentified witness told broadcaster India Today that there was a narrow exit at the venue: ""As we tried to exit towards a field, suddenly a commotion started, and we didn't know what to do.""
Uttar Pradesh is India's most populous state with more than 200 million people. Its Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath ordered an investigation.
""Instructions have been given to the concerned officials to conduct relief and rescue operations on war footing and to provide proper treatment to the injured,"" he posted on X.

Kenya Sevens scrum-half Samuel Asati is brimming with confidence
as the team gears up for the Rugby Africa Sevens and the Paris Olympics, saying
the team has the capacity to finally clinch an Olympic medal.
The 25-year old who also features for KCB RFC, is part of a new
generation of Kenya Shujaa players set to debut at the upcoming Olympic Games
in Paris, and has promised to give his all in pursuit for a medal.
With the recent promotion back into the HSBC World Series after
relegation last season, the coach Kelvin Wambua-led team is in prime form to go
all the way in the two competitions, according to Asati.
“We qualified for the Olympics not to just go and participate
but to go and show what we have to offer in the in the largest sporting event
in the world. We are preparing very well to go and compete, and this time round
we want to for a medal,” said Asati.
Under Wambua, Asati has been a key player since making his debut
during the last Africa 7s in Zambia September 2023, and believes that the
Shujaa squad has what it takes to not only compete but excel on the global
stage.
“Being in the Olympics is the greatest achievement because it is
the biggest sporting event in the world and anyone qualified for it is arguably
ahead of the rest. It means a lot to the whole squad as we only have two Olympians
in the team. As a new generation it means a lot to us, and want to make a big
statement there,” he noted.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/ethiopias-abiy-visits-sudans-army-chief-on-red-sea-coast-n345531,"Ethiopia's Abiy visits Sudan's army chief on Red Sea coast
Ethiopian Premier Abiy Ahmed met Sudan's army chief General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan on Tuesday, becoming the first foreign leader to visit him in his war capital Port Sudan since the start of the conflict between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).
Abiy, who was previously seen as closer to the RSF than the army and hosted its leader Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo in Addis Ababa in December, framed the visit as part of a push to bring stability to Sudan after nearly 15 months of conflict.
The war between the Sudanese military factions has forced almost 10 million people from their homes, created famine-like conditions in parts of the country, and threatened to destabilise the region.
While the RSF has taken most of the capital Khartoum and the centre and west of Sudan, the army controls eastern and northern states, including Port Sudan, which has become its base.
Talks hosted by Saudi Arabia and the United States in Jeddah aimed at brokering a ceasefire stalled last year and attempts to bring the army back to the negotiating table have so far failed.
Images shared by both sides showed Burhan and Abiy laughing and walking hand in hand after the Ethiopian leader's arrival. On X, Abiy's office called the visit part of efforts to find ""sustainable solutions for Sudan's stability"".
A source close to the matter said Abiy had a better chance of achieving a breakthrough by being on the ground.
""The very existence of the Sudan is at stake and when the world turned away, the PM has turned facing the Sudan,"" the source said.
The visit took place after an RSF attack on the southeastern state of Sennar last month brought the war closer to Sudan's border with Ethiopia.
There have been signs the RSF is moving into Gedaref state, which hosts more than 600,000 displaced Sudanese as well as tens of thousands of Ethiopian refugees.
Last month, Sudanese farmers in the state said that Ethiopian Fano militiamen had entered the disputed Fashaga territory between the two countries. Abiy said in a speech on Monday that he would not take advantage of the war to settle the issue, and that his government would not side with any of the parties.
Abiy's visit to Port Sudan also comes despite past tensions with the army.
RSF leader Dagalo, known as Hemedti, chose Addis Ababa as the venue to meet the civilian Taqaddum coalition criticised by the army.
One of Burhan's deputies alleged last year that Ethiopian fighters were backing the RSF.
Abiy is an ally of the United Arab Emirates, which the army accuses of providing material support to the RSF, allegations the UAE denies but U.N. experts say are credible.
""The big question many have is if Abiy could position himself as a mediator between Burhan and the UAE, or carry messages between them,"" said Alan Boswell, Crisis Group's Horn of Africa project director.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/rwandan-troops-fought-alongside-m23-rebels-in-dr-congo-un-experts-n345451,"Rwandan troops fought alongside M23 rebels in DR Congo: UN experts
Published on: July 08, 2024 09:22 (EAT)

Some 3,000-4,000 Rwandan soldiers fought alongside M23 rebels in east DR Congo, said a UN expert report seen by AFP Monday, which noted that Kigali had ""de facto control"" of the group's operations.
The North Kivu province has been in the grip of the M23 (March 23 Movement) rebellion since the end of 2021, with the group seizing swathes of territory in the region and installing a parallel regime in areas now under its control.
Kinshasa has accused Rwanda of backing the mainly Tutsi-led M23 rebel group - an accusation that Kigali has so far denied.
But the report commissioned by the UN Security Council said the Rwandan army's ""de facto control and direction over M23 operations"" renders the country ""liable for the actions of M23"".
Rwanda Defence Force (RDF) military interventions and operations in the Nyiragongo, Rutshuru and Masisi territories -- all in North Kivu -- ""were critical to the impressive territorial expansion achieved between January and March 2024"" by the M23, the report stated.
In response to AFP's request for comment, Rwandan government spokesperson Yolande Makolo accused the Democratic Republic of Congo of having ""consistently threatened war on Rwanda"", and said the country ""will continue to defend itself"".
The report's researchers estimated that at the time of writing in April, the number of Rwandan troops were ""matching if not surpassing"" the number of M23 soldiers, thought to be at around 3,000.
Until the end of 2023, Rwandan authorities publicly denied that their troops were operating alongside M23 rebels in North Kivu, but has not directly commented since then.
The report contains authenticated photographs, drone footage, video recordings, testimony and intelligence, which it says confirm the RDF's systematic border incursions.
The footage and photos show rows of armed men in uniform, operating equipment such as artillery and armoured vehicles with radar and anti-aircraft missile systems, as well as trucks to transport troops.
Rwandan President Paul Kagame said on June 20 on France 24 ""we are ready to fight"" against the Democratic Republic of Congo if necessary, although he avoided the question of his country’s military presence in the country.
For several months the United States, France, Belgium and the European Union have been calling on Rwanda to withdraw its forces and ground-to-air missiles from Congolese soil and to stop supporting the M23.
The report also said that children from the age of 12 have been recruited from ""almost all refugee camps in Rwanda"" to be sent to training camps in the rebel zone under the supervision of Rwandan soldiers and M23 combatants.
""Recruits aged 15 and above were combat-trained and dispatched to the frontlines to fight,"" it said.
It added that the recruitment of minors in Rwanda was generally carried out by intelligence officers ""through false promises of remuneration or employment,"" and that those ""who did not consent were taken forcefully"".
During their offensives the M23 and Rwandan army ""specifically targeted localities, predominantly inhabited by Hutus, in areas known to be strongholds of FDLR"" - the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda.
The FDLR is a Rwandan rebel group formed by former senior Hutu officials behind the genocide of the Tutsi in Rwanda in 1994, who have since taken refuge in DR Congo.
The presence of the group in the eastern DR Congo is considered by Kigali as a threat.
The international community has called for an end to foreign intervention in war-riddled DR Congo and also asked Kinshasa to distance itself from the FDLR.
But the UN report noted that the DRC government has used several ""North Kivu armed groups, including the FDLR, to fight M23 and RDF"".
This mixture of armed groups fighting alongside the Congolese army is known as the Wazalendo – Swahili for patriots.
The experts who wrote the report accused the Wazalendo of numerous violations of human rights and international humanitarian law.
The experts also said they had confirmation of ""active support"" for the M23 from members of the Ugandan intelligence services.
This comes even though Uganda’s army has been working alongside the Congolese army in its fight against another rebel group affiliated with the Islamic State group, some 100 kilometres (62 miles) north of the area under the control of the M23.

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/messi-a-doubt-for-argentina-ahead-of-copa-quarter-final-n345175,"Messi a doubt for Argentina ahead of Copa quarter-final
Lionel Messi's fitness remains in doubt ahead of Thursday's Copa
America quarter-final with Ecuador with coach Lionel Scaloni saying he will
wait before deciding on his team.
Messi missed Argentina's final group stage match on Saturday, a
2-0 win over Peru, after complaining of a sore right hamstring.
Argentina will hold a training session later on Wednesday and
Scaloni said he would make any decision afterwards.
""We'll wait a couple of hours and make the decision. It is
always better to have one more day,"" he told a press conference.
""Yesterday we had good feelings and we'll take this day
to define the team based on the response we get today,"" he added.
Scaloni said he would consult with the 37-year-old Messi about his
readiness for the game.
""We'll try to get him in and then, if he's not (ready), we'll
look for the best solution for the team. I'll talk to him today. I think it's
fair that he takes his time and trains as much as possible,"" he said.
Scaloni made nine changes against Peru as he took the chance to
rotate his squad with qualification to the knockout stage already secured.
Should Messi not be ready to start against Ecuador, Scaloni could
start with both Julian Alvarez and Lautaro Martinez as twin strikers in attack.
Lautaro is the top scorer in the Copa so far with four goals from
three games, including a double against Peru while Alvarez found the target in
the opening game against Canada.
""They have already played together against this rival. We
will make the decision after today's training session. We are not ruling
anything out because they have worked well and it is an option, it could
be,"" said Scaloni.
""Lautaro is doing very well, in a good moment, the same as
Julian. Lautaro has not only done well, but he has waited for his chance and
that makes me very happy. They both scored goals, let's hope that streak
continues tomorrow. We are satisfied with their contributions,"" he said.
Ecuador coach Felix Sanchez said he doesn't expect a radical
change of approach from Argentina -- with or without Messi.
""We know we are playing a high-level team, Lionel Messi is
the player that makes the difference and we have played against them with him
and without him on the field,"" he said.
""Their
gameplan doesn't change much - they are a group who have been with their head
coach for a long time, they know their gameplan and we have had to be ready
either way,"" added the Spaniard.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/kindiki-disputes-human-rights-reports-on-protest-deaths-says-25-killed-400-injured-n345249,"Kindiki disputes Human Rights reports on protest deaths, says 25 killed 400 injured
Kindiki spoke on Citizen TV's The Tonight Show on Thursday night, dismissing reports from human rights organisations that more than 40 people died and over 600 were injured during the protests.
He revealed that only 400 people were injured in the melee, including 43 police officers, contradicting reports of the alleged Githurai massacre, in which scores of people were reportedly injured.
“The people who have died out of these protests are 25 and nearly 400 people were injured including 43 police officers. I have heard of other figures including the ones you are quoting, but I also had heard about a massacre in Githurai from other sources which turned out not to be true so I don’t want to cast aspersions at anybody but we have lost 25 people,” he stated.
Kindiki, who expressed the government's commitment to investigating the deaths, clarified that the majority of the 25 people killed were shot, while the rest died from injuries sustained during beatings.
He stated that the government had since launched an investigation into the killings, and that those found responsible would be prosecuted.
“Many of them died out of gunshot wounds but others died out of blunt objects and trauma caused by beatings and assault and I want to assure the people of Kenyan that of every single person who died, we will account for each of them,” he said.
“We have an account of each and every death, the manner in which they died. Many of them died of gunshot wounds and we have activated ballistic and accosting units of the DCI, the Crime Research and the Intelligence Bureau to help us account for the source of ammunition that killed the people of Kenya but also the circumstances they were killed.”
Despite acknowledging that some police officers used excessive violence, the CS defended the officers' actions, noting that the law allows police to use lethal force in certain circumstances as part of their law enforcement mandate.
Kindi claimed that if the officers' or the people's lives are threatened, the law allows them to take such measures.
“Law enforcers are allowed to use lethal force but only in very exceptional circumstances where their own lives or the lives of people are in grave danger,” he said.
According to the Kenya Human Rights Commission (KHRC), 43 people were killed during the demonstrations, and over 600 were injured.

Indonesian immigration
authorities have detained 103 foreign nationals after a raid at a villa on the
resort island of Bali, officials said Thursday.

This was confirmed by X user Nyandia Gachago on Wednesday who said ""He is safe"" after sharing an image showing four people among them Oguda who had been missing since Tuesday morning.
""He is safe watu wangu,"" she wrote while thanking the Law Society of Kenya (LSK) and its president Faith Odhiambo.
His brother Zachary posted: ""GAB IS FREE. I can't thank you much Twitter community for coming through for our family when we needed you. Ahsanteni sana.""
Oguda, a vocal critic of President William Ruto’s government, was reported to have been taken away from his home at around 2 a.m. by men suspected to be policemen.
His arrest has been linked to his vocal stance online against the unpopular Finance Bill 2024 which has sparked nationwide protests that turned deadly on Tuesday.
Reports of his abduction were shared alongside concerns that other people behind the X pages Franje, Drey Mwangi and Osama Otero, were also captured overnight which sparked a public uproar.
The Law Society of Kenya (LSK) in a statement on Tuesday morning condemned the abductions as a return to darkness.
LSK President Faith Odhiambo vowed that the lawyers' body will bring those orchestrating the abductions to book.
""Over the last 72 hours, Kenya has been drawn back to the dark era of a rogue, irrational police force operating through repressive, retrogressive, clandestine, illegal, extra-judicial tactics to forcefully quell public dissent against misgivings of government, lapses in governance and more specifically, the contentious Finance Bill 2024,"" Odhiambo said.
During a National Assembly sitting on Tuesday, Minority Leader Opiyo Wandayi said that Oguda, who works as a political analyst at his office, called him to notify him that there were suspected officers who tried to breach his compound.
Speaker Moses Wetangula directed that a report on Oguda's whereabouts be availed in 2 hours.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/mackenzie-lured-victims-on-social-media-promised-them-land-before-killing-them-court-told-n345544,"Mackenzie lured victims on social media, promised them land before killing them - Court told
Controversial preacher Paul Mackenzie
leveraged technology and social media to lure victims into the Shakahola forest
where they were massacred, a witness has told the court.
According to a statement by the Office of the
Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP), Mackenzie would then indoctrinate them
with religious extremism and radicalization ideologies and entice them with a
promise of land in the vast area if they remained faithful.
“Mackenzie also promised his victims plenty
of farmland within Shakahola forest on which they will farm and build homes,”
ODPP stated.
Appearing before Shanzu court Senior
Principal Magistrate Leah Juma where Mackenzie and his 94 co-accused were
answering to charges of terrorism over the deaths of more than 400 of his
followers, the witness under protection recounted how the preacher conducted
his activities.
The court heard that Mackenzie first opened a
social media account to mobilize people from far and wide, after which he
promised them that land would be sold to them cheaply to enable them build
temporary homes.
“One by one, people of different walks of
life streamed into the forest situated about 200 kilometres from the Shanzu
court…Men and women, some married, arrived with their children after Mackenzie
assured them of abundant land with the forest. Each arrival was gifted with
some few acres of land sold to them at a throwaway price to put up their
homesteads,” the ODPP stated.
The villages were christened Biblical names
like Bethlehem, Judea and Jericho, among others, with some people losing their
portion of land for defying Mackenzie’s radical teachings such as travelling to
Malindi town - which he referred to as Babel - without his permission.
Magistrate Juma also heard of the horrifying
tales of how the futures of men, women and children were shut down once they
arrived in the forest by Mackenzie, his deputy Smart Deri Mwakalama, and a
clique of trusted radical men who barred anyone from leaving.
“Once inside the villages, the victims were
indoctrinated into his radical teachings anchored on doomsday under the strict
supervision of the armed militia tasked to deal with any escapee,” added the ODPP.
“The armed militia disguised as Good News
International Ministries (GNIM) church followers, secluded families, who had
brainwashed with teachings including discarding worldly affairs and loathing
the state system… the court heard that victims were cut off from the rest of
the world and their lives were brutally snuffed out as days passed.”
Later on, the brainwashed parents were
informed that taking their children to schools and hospitals was an ungodly
act, as Mackenzie also destroyed any non-Biblical literature.
The development led to the preacher ordering
parents to starve their children to death under a ruse that they would enter
heaven, an act which was undertaken under the strict supervision of his armed
militia.
The witness, who managed to escape, described
the deaths of children as harrowing and heartbreaking, saying they still haunt
him.

Skoda Fabia's Samman Vohra secured his second win of the 2024 Kenya National Rally Championship season following brilliant displays in Nanyuki.
The son of former Kenya Motor Sports Federation (KMSF) Chairman the late JS Vohra, led the Nanyuki Rally Group round from start to finish winning six out of six stages.
Defending Champion Jasmeet Chana came in second incidentally on his very first outing behind the wheel of a Ford Fiesta R5.
The legendary Ian Duncan, winner of the 1994 WRC Safari Rally, completed the podium winning the Classic Car category at the wheel of his Datsun 280Z.
Samman won the season- opening event in Eldoret but retired on Safari following a mishap on Kasarani SSS Stage.
Aakif Virani, winner of Nanyuki Rally in 2021, suffered adversity when his Skoda Fabia R5 went up in flames on CS4, the repeat run of Mlima Hema speed test. Both Aakif and his navigator escaped unscathed.
Following the stopping of SS 4 – Mlima Hema 2 due to an incident involving Aakif’s Skoda, and in accordance with Article 44 and 44.1 of the KMSF National Competition Rules (NCRs), a time of 21:57.9 was allocated to Ian Duncan, Shakeel Khan, Joey Ghose, lady driver Lisa Christoffersen and youngster Neel Gohil who finished fifth overall.
“Having considered that cars No. 7, 20, 25, 55 and 99 were shown a red flag, following the fire incident, and having considered that times and split times set before the stopping of the stage, a time of 21:57.9 was allocated to the rest of the drivers,” said Clerk of the Course Bimal Patel.
Nanyuki Rally is one of the longest running KNRC events. It joined the elite KNRC series in 1998, incidentally the same year former President Moi's son, the late Jonathan Toroitich, aka JT, emerged the Victor.
Following the weekend result, Samman now reclaims the KNRC lead from Carl Tundo who did not enter the Nanyuki leg. He now leads the series on 66points followed by Jasmeet Chana on 53.
Reigning Champion Jasmeet said: ""Nanyuki was good. We managed P2 despite some teething problems with our new Fiesta. In one of the stages our radiator was clogged up with grass, so the engine was running hot, but after that we were okay. We are getting used to the new car.""

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/england-beat-switzerland-to-keep-euro-2024-dream-alive-n345358,"England beat Switzerland to keep Euro 2024 dream alive
After the 120 minutes finished level at 1-1, goalkeeper Jordan Pickford was the Three Lions' hero in the shoot-out as he saved Switzerland's first spot-kick from Manuel Akanji.
Cole Palmer, Jude Bellingham, Bukayo Saka, Ivan Toney and Trent Alexander-Arnold converted their penalties to send England into a semi-final meeting with Turkey or the Netherlands in Dortmund on Wednesday.
After needing Bellingham's 95th-minute equaliser before going on to beat Slovakia in extra time in the last 16, England were again staring at defeat with 10 minutes to go.
A dreary encounter for the first 75 minutes came to life after Breel Embolo put Switzerland in front.
Saka's fine strike from outside the box levelled with England's first shot on target five minutes later.
Manchester City defender Akanji was then the unfortunate penalty villain as Switzerland's horrible record in major tournament quarter-finals goes on.
They have now lost five without ever reaching a semi-final.
By contrast, England march on despite another in a string of underwhelming performances from Gareth Southgate's men.
In his 100th match in charge of his country, Southgate again resisted calls for mass changes in personnel but did alter his system.
Ezri Konsa made his first ever competitive international start in place of the suspended Marc Guehi as England switched to a back three.
However, contrary to expectation, Saka remained on the right in what proved to be an inspired decision by Southgate.
The Arsenal winger was by far the biggest threat of a first half in which neither side managed a shot on target.
Saka was skipping beyond Michel Aebischer at will and created the best chance of the first period when Kobbie Mainoo saw an effort deflected behind just before the half-time whistle.
The game continued at the same laboured pace from both sides into the second half.
Embolo finally managed the first shot on goal when his weak effort was easily handled by Jordan Pickford.
Southgate has been repeatedly criticised for being too slow to influence games with his substitutions.
Despite having one of the most richly-talented squads at the tournament, it took until they fell behind for Southgate to shake things up.
England looked headed for a meek exit when Embolo pounced at the far post to turn in Dan Ndoye's deflected cross at the back post.
Southgate reacted immediately with Palmer, Eberechi Eze and Luke Shaw, making his first appearance since February, sent on.
Within five minutes England were level as Saka cut inside and fired low and hard in off the far post.
Switzerland were indebted to a brilliant save from Yann Sommer to deny Declan Rice a second for England early in extra time.
Harry Kane was then forced off injured after a nasty fall into the England dugout.
And it was Switzerland who came closest in the second half of extra time as Xherdan Shaqiri's corner came back off the woodwork before Pickford parried Zeki Amdouni's powerful strike from distance.
England won only one of five previous penalty shoot-outs at the Euros, including defeat by Italy in the final three years ago.
But they were perfect from the spot as Saka erased some of the pain from his decisive miss in the Euro 2020 final.

coach Gibson Weru has faulted the national U20 team, Chipu, for their
inefficient play in set pieces which he says cost them the game against Netherlands
at the World Rugby U20 Trophy in Scotland.
Chipu were hammered 51-3 by
the Dutch in their second pool match having lost 25-7 in their opening game
against Uruguay, and Weru says the team needs to do more to improve on their
set pieces.
“From what I saw I think we
struggled in the line outs and set pieces are a big part of the game, and we
could not gain an ascendancy defensively and at the same time during our
attacks. We struggled in the line outs and that made us lose a lot of
possession. Again, from my own perspective the kicking game was not where it's
supposed to be,"" said Weru.
Noting how crucial set
pieces are in rugby, Weru says it is the weapon that Netherlands used to slay
Simon Jawichre’s boys.
“I think Netherlands had a
very good kicking game which put us under so much pressure and we ended up
losing possession. Rugby is a game of playing with the ball and we didn’t adapt
to playing without the ball, so we really struggled and I think they
(Netherlands) had a game plan that worked for them,” noted Weru.
The former Kenyan
international further says that the team needs consistent training in camp to help
them harness its potential.
“It’s not a matter of being
in camp for three weeks, it’s a matter of being in camp for a long duration of
time. If they are elite players then three weeks would be sufficient, but these
are young boys who develop over time, so they need to be in camp continuously
over a period of time. If we can have them in camp for at least six months then
maybe that can translate to a result; and then making sure we play competitive
games,” said the Oilers tactician.
“But I must say the caliber
of players they have in that cohort is quite special and they need to be
nurtured. If you look at most of them, they are playing in the Kenya Cup and
they need to play at that level so that they can be able to compete a little
bit better,” he added.
Kenya will take on USA on
Friday, July 12, at 4.30pm East African Time in their final group match game
and will hope things work in their favor if they are to win at least a single
match in the tournament.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/lsk-demands-resignation-of-john-chebochok-as-tea-factory-director-following-sexual-misconduct-allegations-n345578,"LSK demands resignation of John Chebochok as tea factory director amid sexual misconduct allegations
In a statement on Wednesday, LSK noted that Chebochok's election into the office is alarming since he has been linked to cases of sexual exploitation against female workers at a James Finlay Limited factory in Kericho.
He was secretly filmed in an exposé by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) in 2023 titled 'Sex for Work: The True Cost of Our Tea' showing him preying on female workers at the factory in exchange for employment.
After heaping public outcry, KTDA disowned Chebochok's appointment, noting that it had no role to play in awarding him the position and that the election process was conducted by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC).
LSK questioned why Chebochok was allowed to contest for the seat despite the grievous allegations, arguing that his new appointment undermines efforts to safeguard women's rights within the tea industry.
""It sends a troubling message that individuals with allegations of sexual misconduct can still attain positions of power, thereby potentially perpetuating a culture of impunity and fear among women workers,"" said LSK.
""Allowing Mr. Chebochok to assume a leadership role not only jeopardizes the welfare of female workers but also tarnishes the reputation of the Kenyan tea industry on the global stage.""
LSK therefore called for Chebochok's immediate resignation, further wanting IEBC to review its vetting procedures to conform with the provisions of Chapter 6 of the Constitution to prevent persons with questionable characters from being elected to leadership positions.
It also wanted KTDA to implement robust policies to ensure the safety and protection of all workers from sexual harassment and exploitation.
Further, KTDA has been asked to be transparent on the steps being taken to address the concerns on Chebochok's appointment and should hold accountable those who fail to uphold ethical standards.
James Finlay Limited and Lipton Teas and Infusions have called for the immediate removal of Chebochok from the position.
In a letter penned by Group Corporate Affairs Director Ben Woolf, the international tea supplier noted that although Chebochok was not formally charged for the alleged offenses, the undercover footage and the testimonies of survivors presented in the documentary cannot be disregarded.
""We are writing to request that you immediately remove John Chebochok from his position as Director of Toror Tea Factory, a KTDA factory,"" said Finlays in the letter addressed to senior KTDA officials.
They have also since ceased purchasing tea from Toror Factory and urged other stakeholders to follow suit until Chebochok is removed as director.
Meanwhile, Chebochok has issued a demand letter to the BBC demanding a Ksh.100 million defamation settlement over their documentary.
Through his lawyer Danstan Omari, Chebochok pointed out that the claims were orchestrated by his competitors both in politics as well as the tea sector who allegedly sought to buy out Finlays from the factory.
""Politicians who are against our client’s political bid appeared to have been angered that he implemented mechanization at Finlay and as a result, some of their voters lost jobs and the said competitors fought the said process unsuccessfully,"" read a letter in part.

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/kenya-kabaddi-team-calls-for-government-support-after-conquering-africa-n344998,"Kenya Kabaddi team calls for government support after conquering Africa
After securing their victory against Uganda in the Africa 2024
Championship final on Saturday, June 29, 2024, Kenya national men’s Kabaddi
team is celebrating their success while highlighting a pressing issue – the lack
of support from the government, specifically the Ministry of Sports.
Team captain David Silishia has expressed disappointment over
what he described as neglect from the ministry, despite ensuring Kenya are
crowned the African champions.
“Kabaddi is a very good sport and our players are putting in the
effort, but sometimes we do not get the necessary support from the ministry,”
Silishia emphasized.
Despite their recent triumph, including a bronze medal at the
Bangabandhu Cup in Bangladesh, Silishia highlighted the discrimination in
treatment compared to their colleague in other sports.
“Just the other day we won a bronze medal in the Bangabandhu Cup
but up to date, we have not received a single congratulatory message from the Ministry,”
lamented Silishia.
Silishia also highlighted the stark contrast in support between
Kabaddi and other disciplines considered prominent like the women's volleyball
team, Malkia Strikers.
“Malkia Strikers receive comprehensive support at Kasarani,
including medical care, while many of our players struggle with injuries
without such resources,” he noted.
David Kamweti, named the man-of-the-match after Saturday's
triumph, echoed Silishia's sentiments, emphasizing the team's potential with
adequate backing.
“With proper support, we believe we can conquer the world at the
Kabaddi World Cup. We have talent and dedication, we just need the Ministry's
support to realize our full potential,” Kamweti declared optimistically.
However, amidst the calls for support, Kenya Kabaddi Union
Secretary General Japheth Munyendo expressed gratitude to the government, for
enabling the successful hosting of the Africa Kabaddi Championship in Nairobi.
“I want to thank the Kenyan government for creating an enabling
environment for us to host the tournament,” Munyendo acknowledged.
As Kenya's Kabaddi team
gears up for next year's World Cup in England, their appeal for governmental
support echoes strongly as they aim to capitalize on their recent successes and
leave a mark on the global stage.

Karua stated that ""dialogue can only be meaningful if the players are in good faith and guided by the best interests of the people.""
""Let’s be careful as the political class lest we hijack the genuine clamour for accountability and reforms by the GenZ. I agree with those who say Action Now on the clear and attainable demands of the GenZ to enhance accountability and make the state work for the masses rather than for a handful elites,"" Karua said.
""This is a trap period,"" she added.
On the other hand, her Azimio la Umoja counterpart Eugene Wamalwa has said he is not boarding, meaning he rejects calls for a dialogue.
Their reaction comes hours after Ruto, backed by opposition leader Raila Odinga, announced a six-day multi-sectoral dialogue forum beginning Monday, July 15, to discuss issues pressing Kenyans.
Ruto said the forum will draw representatives from political parties, religious groups, civil society, employers and youth.
“In the interest of making sure we live within our means; all participants will bear their attendance costs. This is a result of consultations we have held this morning,” he said.
The President said the forum “will propose the way forward for the country.”
This follows deadly anti-government protests spearheaded by Gen Z, that led to the killing of over 40 people by security forces, and forced Ruto to drop the unpopular Finance Bill 2024.
Gen Zs have continued to agitate for change, forcing Ruto to lay down austerity measures that will limit government spending.
Ruto has also engaged the jilted youth on social media platforms, and promised changes that also include reducing the number of his advisers and scrapping off some state corporations.

Gen Zs have now seemingly shifted their
protests to counties, with two parallel demonstrations scheduled for Thursday in
separate Rift Valley devolved units.
The planned demos come barely 24 hours after
protesters held peaceful demonstrations in Nandi County, complaining about
stalled projects while at the same time demanding for the audit of all
procurement contracts.
Hundreds of protesters on Tuesday marched to
Nandi Governor Stephen Sang's office, seeking answers for delayed projects in
the county.
""Hatuoni mpango wa Governor; hakuna hata
lami huku Nandi. Governor aende nyumbani kama hafanyi kazi,"" Hillary
Tanui, a resident, stated.
Governor Sang' however did not address the
protesters.
The demos have spread to the neighbouring
counties of Kericho and Bomet, where protests have been scheduled for Thursday.
Bomet Governor Hillary Barchok has since
claimed that politicians are orchestrating planned demonstrations in his county
to undermine service delivery.
""I am fully committed to acting on issues
of the Gen Zs, my administration cannot ignore that all is not well in our
county. This government is all inclusive,"" he said.
In neighboring Kericho County, protesters aim
to pressure Governor Eric Mutai's administration to account for compensation
funds for Londiani accident victims, among other audit queries.

Kenya Police Bullets FC head coach Beldine Odemba says they will
hit camp for early preparations ahead of the Cecafa Women Club Championship to
be held in August in Ethiopia.
Speaking on Citizen TV’s Sporty Monday show, Odemba said the
girls will have to sacrifice their rest period in order to get ready for the
tournament.
Bullets were crowned the FKF Women’s Premier League champions on
Wednesday, June 26, 2024, sealing off the league in style with a 3-0 drubbing
of Bunyore Starlets.
“We have to begin early preparations in order to be ready for
the tournament that will be very key, and it will take sacrifice from everyone.
I know they will not have enough time to rest but we have no option,” said
Odemba.
The head coach also said they are planning to bolster their
squad in all departments to increase firepower, as they eye a CAF Women’s
Champions League slot.
“We know we have a good team but we have many competitions to
take part in, and we have already identified the players that we will need to
strengthen the team in all departments,” she noted.
Police Bullets won their first premier league title this season
on their debut, after acquiring three-time women’s premier league winners,
Thika Queens last year.
Odemba attributed the recent league victory to hard work and
teamwork from every stakeholder.
“It is all about team work
and hard work that won us the title. Every stakeholder played their part in
this success and we hope more will come in future,” averred the head coach, who
is also in charge of the national women’s U20 team, Rising Starlets.

https://www.citizen.digital/entertainment/azziad-nasenya-sets-the-record-straight-on-paris-olympics-dubai-trip-controversy-n345657,"Azziad Nasenya sets the record straight on Paris Olympics, Dubai trip controversy
Taking to Instagram, where she boasts over 2.3 million followers, the sensational starlet categorically stated that she was not one of the people the Ministry of Youth Affairs was planning to fly out to Paris, also clarifying her initial association with the Ministry.
She wrote : ""I am not part of the Kenya delegation to the Paris Olympics 2024. It is unfortunate that someone would come up with false allegations on such a matter. My involvement with the Ministry of Youth Affairs, Creative Economy, and Sports was centred around the Creatives Technical Committee of the Talanta Hela Council, headed by Daniel Ndambuki, AKA Churchill.""
""I was selected and mandated to represent the younger population in the Creatives Technical Committee. However, the committee was disbanded in June 2023. I've not involved myself since.""
Nasenya went ahead to say that her last trip to Dubai, which caused controversy and misinformation online, was actually fully funded by the organizers behind the #VisitDubai initiative and not by the government of Kenya, further revealing that it was a content-creation trip whose receipts she had already published on her socials.
""I would also like to make it clear that my travel to Dubai and other places have been financed by myself, clients, or family, and never, as numerously claimed, by the Government of Kenya,"" she stated.
""There were allegations that I travelled to Dubai using money meant to renovate a stadium. At the time, I was in Dubai recording content for the #VisitDubai campaign, a trip that was fully funded by the client. The receipts are on my socials-smart, so people can confirm instead of believing rumours.""
Nasenya, who shot to fame circa 2020 after participating in the dance challenge #Utawezana, also added her voice to the ongoing Gen-Z conversation, lauding her generation for their efforts and condoling with the families who lost their loved ones to police brutality.
""As a Gen Z, I am proud of all that we have accomplished in addressing government accountability in the last few days. My heart goes out to the families who lost their loved ones while we fought for the future of our country,"" she said.
Nasenya's statement comes after intense public pressure has been applied on Sports Cabinet Secretary Ababu Namwamba to make public the full list of everyone traveling to Paris for the Olympics.
Many Kenyans have expressed fears that the CS might include tens of joyriders to the trip all on the Kenyan taxpayers' budget with others even going to court to pressure for the same.

Aldrine Kibet, 17, football prodigy, has rapidly ascended the ranks of Kenyan football this year.
Representing St. Anthony’s Kitale, Kibet's outstanding performance in the Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association (KSSSA) tournament in August catapulted him into the spotlight.
Playing as an attacking midfielder, his skills and vision on the field are unmatched, making him a standout player in the tournament.
Kibet’s journey took a significant leap when he was selected for Kenya’s national U20 squad earlier this year. His participation in the tournament in Malawi showcased his talent on an international stage, earning him attention from coaches and scouts.
Now, poised to feature in Kenya's U23 team for the COSAFA Cup tournament in South Africa, Kibet is ready to make his mark once again.
Reflecting on his experiences, Kibet shared his excitement and determination.
“It's a great opportunity for me to represent my country. At first, I was in disbelief, but now I'm ready to work together with the team. Getting to the national stage has really shown me what's more into football,” he said.
“Joining the national team exposes you to new coaches who offer new types of game play, so my experience with the national team has been perfect because every time I come, I learn something new,” he added.
Kibet’s versatility has been a key factor in his success. While his primary position is an attacking midfielder, he has also demonstrated his ability to adapt to other roles on the field.
“Playing for the national team also teaches you to adapt to new positions in the field. As an attacking midfielder, I'm also able to play number 6, 8, and 10. So right now, I'm comfortable playing in any of those positions,” he explained.
His journey with the national U23 team is set to begin with a tough Group B, where they will face formidable opponents Zambia, Comoros, and Zimbabwe.
The first challenge awaits them against Zambia on June 27, 2024 at NMB Stadium.
Despite the tough competition, Kibet remains optimistic and focused on the opportunity ahead.
Kibet’s aspirations extend beyond the national stage. Since childhood, he has dreamt of playing for Barcelona, a vision he has frequently shared with his parents.
“Since I was young, it has always been my dream to go to Spain, and it's something I've always shared with my parents. For me, it's a dream come true, but I'm not yet where I want to be until I get to play for Barcelona in the future,” he said.
As Aldrine Kibet prepares to participate at COSAFA tournament, his journey serves as an inspiration to young footballers across Kenya.

Unshaken Chavakali head coach Hillary Muleri lauded his charges for the game displayed in the finals.
“Ebwali were at home with a huge fan base but if today’s results are anything to go by, we have given them a run for their money. Our game was different from how we played when we met Ebwali at group stage,” Muleri said.
Muleri warned that if he meets Ebwali in the regionals he will punish them: “I have known their stronghold. Let them not over depend on Austin Odongo. Everyone has watched our match and can easily lay strategies to contain Odongo,” Muleri whose side exited the finals at Sub-County stage last said noting that Chavakali team is now up to the task to lift the national soccer title. Ebwali also exited the competitions at group stage last year.
In girls' soccer, last year's finalists Madira Soccer Assassins and the Maroon Queens met only for Madira to get revenge by beating Ibubi 3-1 in spot kicks. The match had ended in a 1-1 stalemate.
“From last year, we proceeded to the regionals as first runners up at County level after Ibubi edged us 1-0.
""The competition this year is tough but if we put in more effort we can lift the national trophy and represent Kenya in the East African Secondary School Sports Association in Soccer,”Madira Girls skipper Hellen Mito said.
Madira Girls also bagged the rugby 7s title with Joy Owiti taking the most valuable player honours. Madira qualified together with Kisangula, Kevehe and Idavaga Muslim secondary school teams. Vihiga Boys who emerged winners also produced Brandon Lilumbi as the Most Valuable player. Other Boys teams in Rugby include Senende, Chavakali and Nyang’ori.
Vihiga Boys and Chavakali Boys will represent Vihiga in the Boys team while Mudavadi Girls and Chamakanga Secondary teams will represent Vihiga in the girls’ category.
Basketball qualifying teams are Chavakali Boys, Ebunangwe Boys, Vihiga Boys, Hobunaka Boys, defending champions Tigoi Girls who proceed to regionals together with Bunyore Girls, Vokoli Girls and St. Clares Maragoli Girls with Sydnye Iravu from Tigoi being crowned the most valuable player in Basketball 3x3.
St. Clares Maragoli Girls won the netball trophy followed by Mudavadi Girls, and Hobunaka Girls where Edel Queen from St. Clares was crowned the most valuable player.

Law Society of Kenya (LSK) President Faith
Odhiambo has urged President William Ruto's administration to compensate
Kenyans injured during the ongoing anti-government demonstrations nationwide.
Addressing journalists outside the Kenyatta
National Hospital (KNH) where he visited some of the victims on Friday, Ms. Odhiambo
referenced recent utterances made by Ruto where he indicated that the
government would ""account for"" those injured, intimating that this
implied compensation.
""The Head of State confirmed that the
injured will be accounted for. We hope that will account for compensation so
that we won't need to go to court to ensure that these victims are
compensated,"" she said.
""We came here to assure the victims that
once they are discharged they can reach out to us so that we can give them all
the legal support they may need.""
She subsequently urged Kenyans to avail
themselves in large numbers at KNH and donate blood for persons injured during
the demonstrations.
The LSK boss noted that numerous Kenyans have
already joined the blood drive, but encouraged others to avail themselves as
well to ensure adequate supply is reached.
""We are happy that Kenyans came out in
large numbers to donate blood and those who still want to join in are free to
do so to support some of these patients that are still undergoing
treatment,"" she said.
""A lot of them have received surgeries
save for some who were brought in yesterday but they are scheduled for surgery
today. The doctors are doing the best they can given the varying injuries and
we thank KNH for receiving and treating the injured in large numbers.""
Ms. Odhiambo added that some of the injured
but discharged protesters will require further treatment and referrals as they
continue on their rehabilitation journeys.
""We met the patients and assured them of
our support,"" she stated.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/rutos-uda-receives-ksh316m-of-political-parties-fund-while-odm-gets-ksh168m-n344902,"Ruto's UDA receives Ksh.316M of Political Parties' Fund while ODM gets Ksh.168M
Registrar of Political Parties Ann Nderitu has
announced allocations to various political outfits in the Financial Year
2023/2024, with the ruling United Democratic Alliance (UDA) set to pocket the
lion’s share with a disbursement of slightly over Ksh.316 million.
Ms. Nderitu, in a gazette notice published on
Friday, announced that the new allocation of the Political Parties Fund was occasioned
by the second revision of the Supplementary Estimates.
The Registrar had slashed funds allocated to the
political parties in the first revision in January 2024, in which the UDA was
supposed to receive Ksh.237 million.
The opposition Orange Democratic Movement (ODM)
party’s funds were increased from the Ksh.127 million allocated in January to Ksh.168
million in the June allocation.
The Jubilee party has been allocated Ksh.74 million
up from Ksh.55 million, while the Wiper Democratic Movement’s funds shot up
from Ksh.29 million to Ksh.39 million.
The Kenya African National Union (KANU) also
received Ksh.13 million from the initial Ksh.9 million.
“In exercise of the powers conferred by sections
23, 25 and 34 of the Political Parties Act, 2011 and Regulation 6 of the
Political Parties (Funding) Regulations 2019, the Registrar of Political
Parties gives notice that Political Parties Fund (PPF) allocation has been
revised during Supplementary Estimates No. 2 of FY 2023/24 and this has
necessitated review of the distribution of the Fund,” read the gazette notice
in part.
According to the notice, the allocated funds will
be distributed upon receipt from the National Treasury.
The June allocations, despite being increases from
what was initially set out in January, are significant decreases from those of the
Financial Year 2022/2023.
During the November 2022 allocation, the UDA party received over half a billion shillings while ODM got Ksh.38 million, Jubilee (Ksh.135
million), and Wiper (Ksh.72 million).
In line with Section 25 of the Political Parties
Act, 95 per cent of the Fund is allocated to the total number of votes secured
by each political party in the preceding General Election and 5 per cent
accounts for the administration expenses of the Fund.
A party may however not receive funding if they
fail to secure at least 5 per cent of the total number of votes in the previous
General Election.
Further, a party will be denied funding if more than two-thirds of its registered office bearers are of the same gender.

According to reports, the mob descended on the police station after learning that a murder suspect accused of killing his brother on Tuesday night had been locked up there.
For the better part of Wednesday morning, a mob of women, men, and children engaged police in running battles, demanding that the suspect be released to them.
Police officers deployed to contain the mob lobbed tear gas and used rubber bullets, but tear gas ran out after a long running battle.
The mob eventually overpowered the police, pelting their landcruisers with stones before breaking into the cells and fishing out the suspect before beating him to death.
The suspect who was beaten to death is said to have plotted with his other brother to murder their sibling.

Published on: July 02, 2024 07:03 (EAT)
Tickets for the women's Euro 2025 in Switzerland will go on sale from Oct. 1, with Europe's football governing body UEFA hoping to surpass the record of nearly 574,000 fans who attended games at the previous tournament in England.
In line with the boom in popularity of women's football, 720,000 tickets will be on sale ranging from 20-40 Swiss francs ($22-44) for the 16-team tournament across eight venues from July 2-27 next year.
A ticket launch event is planned on one of Switzerland's best-known mountain peaks, the Jungfraujoch.
""This location perfectly highlights the tournament’s narrative, 'The Summit of Emotions', evoking the pinnacle of European competitive sport, while paying tribute to Switzerland's stunning mountain landscape,"" UEFA said in a statement.
With environmental concerns now high on the agenda at major sporting events, Euro 2025 ticket holders will be offered free public transport to games around Switzerland.
""We anticipate an outstanding tournament that will create a lasting legacy in Switzerland and beyond, with fans coming to enjoy another wonderful celebration of football,"" UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin said.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/president-ruto-refutes-dp-gachaguas-account-on-security-intelligence-n344958,"President Ruto refutes DP Gachagua's account on security intelligence
The Head of State spoke at State House during a presidential roundtable, revealing that the State had adequate intelligence.
He said there were intelligence reports that criminal elements were planning to infiltrate Tuesday's peaceful protests, which culminated in a dramatic but historic raid on the August House.
""We had information, and that is why we prepared in the manner that we did, If we had not prepared, we would be counting different numbers of those who died,"" President Ruto said.
""Criminals mobilised heavily; in fact, many peaceful protesters left town by 10 a.m. after realising criminals had joined the protests.""
President Ruto also disagreed with his deputy on the issue of extrajudicial killings, telling the roundtable that claims that they had resumed under his watch were false.
""It is not fair to discuss the deputy president here because he is not present to explain the context in which he said those things,"" President Ruto stated.
When asked whether he had spoken with Gachagua about his claims of the return of killings, President Ruto asked the interviewers to direct their questions to Gachagua.
""I'm sure if you interview the deputy president he will answer that appropriately... but take it from me, extra-judicial killings will not be part of an administration that I'm part of,"" he added.
Last week, shortly after holding a press briefing in which he said his administration was dropping the widely-rejected Finance Bill, 2024, his deputy called a media briefing, accusing Kenya's spy agency of failing to give sufficient briefs.
According to Gachagua, if Noordin Haji, the NIS Director General, had properly informed Ruto of the widespread public opposition to the Bill, Ruto would not have forwarded it to Parliament, avoiding the nationwide protests that erupted on Tuesday, culminating in protesters storming Parliament.
""People had to die, property was destroyed, and protests were held to let the President know how Kenyans felt, but there is an organisation funded by Kenyans to inform the president and the public about Kenyan sentiments.""
""Officers from the National Police Service (NPS) have told me in confidence that they did not receive advance intelligence briefs about the magnitude of the protests. Never have protesters invaded Parliament.""
Gachagua continued his tirade, harshly criticising Haji, claiming that he was unfit and lacked the qualifications for the top position in the NIS.
""When he (Haji) was appointed to the office of the Director General, he chased away all the people who were senior to him when he was in the service because of an inferiority complex, crippling NIS and making it dysfunctional,"" he said.
""Three directors were chased away and reassigned to desk jobs across the government. 13 assistant directors, men and women with proven track records of intelligence and analysis, were removed from the NIS leaving a shell under a clueless Director General with no capacity to run the organisation. That is why the security sector was caught off guard by the intensity of the protests. Had Noordin Haji done his job; we would not be where we are today.""

https://www.citizen.digital/news/peter-salasyas-payslip-ignites-debate-on-kenyan-mps-real-worth-and-frivolous-expenditures-n345213,"Peter Salasya's payslip ignites debate on Kenyan MPs real worth and frivolous expenditures
On July 3, the MP, who is never shy of sharing his lifestyle with Kenyans, took to his social media pages to share his June salary - inviting Kenyans to dissect his earnings and gawk at his significant deductions.
""Hii ndio salary yangu. Kama yangu inakaa hivi, ya askari mwalimu na daktari zinakaa aje?"" Salasya said.
From the payslip, apart from the MP's basic salary of Ksh.435,301, the MP was paid an administrative allowance of Ksh. 140,201, a house allowance of Ksh.150,000 and a sitting allowance of Ksh.67,500.
The MP was also paid a telephone allowance of Ksh.15,000 and a vehicle fixed cost of Ksh.356,525.
The basic pay plus allowances totalled Ksh.1,164,527.
However, the amount was subjected to glaringly huge deductions which reduced his net pay significantly.
From the amount, Ksh.360,466 was deducted as PAYE, Ksh.541,947 went to mortgage, the staff pension fund took Ksh.54,847, Ksh.16,455 was deducted as Housing Levy and NHIF took Ksh.1,700.
Other deductions are Ksh.85,981 for car loan, Ksh.4,640 for ration and messing, Ksh.5,000 for Kenya Young Parliament Association (KYPA), Sacco Deposits Ksh.10,000, Housing Shares Ksh.10,000, Pacoso shares Ksh.70,000 and Car loan life insurance Ksh.1,124.
In total, the deductions came to Ksh.1,162,162, leaving the MP with a paltry Ksh.2,364 as net pay.
After the slip went viral, many Kenyans online reacted differently, with the vast majority saying that some of Salasya's expenses were his own making and that he did not deserve sympathy from Kenyans for deductions he was solely responsible for.
Financial analyst Kachwanya said, ""When you take loans, mortgage and shares, those are personal commitments that should not be used to seek sympathy from the public...their salaries should be reduced to Ksh.200K max!""
Someone else said, ""Now, ask yourself how this man survives throughout the month with less than 3k. Obviously, this is where handouts come into play. And CDF money too. These people will never fail to be corrupt!""
X personality Dr. Reign also weighed in, saying, ""And then you want to pay Kenyans that studied medicine for 7 years a taxable stipend of 70k. Even us medical specialists with decades of experience don’t get half this salary!""
On Dr. Kingori's YouTube show, the host asked Busia Senator Okiya Omtatah to explain the payslip and give his perspective.
After a breakdown of the deductions, Omtatah said,"" The car loan is a car grant. When you go in the Senate, you're given a car grant of 7.5 million. You don't have to pay it back. All you needed to do is to produce a logbook to show that you have the car.""
""If you've gotten a car loan, it means you've gone to get an extra expenditure which, maybe, you didn't require. It's a question of managing lifestyles.""
Omtatah went on to say that most of Salasya's deductions were his own creations - things he could have easily avoided by checking his lifestyle.
""If you look at most of those deductions, they're self-inflicted challenges. The first line of income for me, is my lifestyle...."" he said.
On the MP's half a million deductions on mortgage, Omtatah said, ""You're talking about 26-28 million shillings. That's money which could have gone into putting up a big palace at home or here in Nairobi.""
On Citizen TV's Day Break show, Belgut MP Nelson Koech said, ""Members of Parliament are living a lie; a fake life; an illusion. They take loans to give out in Harambees so that they can be reelected and continue to live this life that is not real.""

https://www.citizen.digital/wananchi-reporting/wananchi-opinion-finance-bill-protests-how-to-create-value-during-unprecedented-times-n345055,"WANANCHI OPINION: Finance Bill protests: How to create value during unprecedented times
Kenyan Gen Z who constitute about 33% of the population, used social platforms like WhatsApp and Zello to coordinate and lead protests. Major demands had a particular focus on the high cost of living, unemployment, corruption, and government accountability.
This unrest in Kenya echoes similar historical movements like the Civil Rights Movement and Occupy Wall Street in the United States. Parallel to the Civil Rights Movement, Kenya's youth are leading demonstrations and mass action with justice and equality as their main objectives.
Inferring comparisons with Occupy Wall Street, the economic focus and social media utilization highlight economic disparities and critique policies that widen the economic divide in the country.
Tackling these problems requires acquiring an innovative and sustainable solutions approach. Here's where Creating Shared Value (CSV) comes in. Entrepreneurship is about addressing societal problems, advancing human welfare, and gaining economic advantages. Valid business models constitute three crucial elements: value creation pegged on solving a problem , value distribution, and how value is captured back as economic benefits.
CSV advocates for enterprises solving societal challenges while adding value. This warrants that companies not only focus on profit making but capturing social value by addressing societal challenges such as poverty, unemployment, hunger, inequality among many others. Embedding CSV into business models will mitigate factors driving the current Gen Z protests in Kenya.
Practical ways of applying CSV calls for businesses to innovate products and services addressing the high cost of living. By innovating these solutions the private sector will directly impact young Kenyans' daily lives. Engaging and promoting ethical behaviors will combat corruption, restoring trust and accountability in systems.
The role of Government of the day is in fostering an environment conducive to CSV's success. Encouraging and mainstreaming policies promotes the private sector to embrace CSV practices enabling the government to bridge economic growth with social progress. This might involve things like offering incentives for businesses prioritizing sustainability and contributing to societal welfare.
The protests in Kenya point to a notable shift in political dynamics by stressing issue-based activism over traditional tribal affiliations. When enterprises embrace CSV principles, they will lead this transformation towards economic and social change. In essence, entrepreneurship transcends profit-making to mold a more just society enabling sustainable development and shared prosperity.

Published on: July 01, 2024 09:55 (EAT)
Injured men lay in a van as they arrive for treatment after a wave of suicide attacks in the North East of Nigeria, in Maiduguri on June 29, 2024.
At least 18 people were killed and 19 seriously wounded in suicide attacks targeting a wedding, a hospital and a funeral in northeastern Nigeria on June 29, authorities said. The region has been scarred by more than a decade of violence by jihadist group Boko Haram, which did not immediately claim responsibility for the string of attacks. (Photo by Audu MARTE / AFP)
The death toll from multiple suicide bombings in the northeastern Nigerian town of Gwoza over the weekend has risen to 32, the country's vice president Kashim Shettima said Monday.
Saturday's attacks involving female suicide bombers targeting a wedding, a hospital and a funeral was one of the worst in northeast Nigeria in years, a reminder of the darker days of the country's long-running jihadist war.
""So far, 32 people lost their lives. Forty-two (injured) were brought from Gwoza,"" Shettima said, visiting a hospital in the Borno State capital Maiduguri where some of the wounded were being treated.
Initial reports estimated the death toll at 18 people.
No group has claimed the blasts, but the Boko Haram jihadist group is active around Gwoza.
More than 40,000 people have been killed and another two million people displaced by the fighting which started in 2009.
Suicide bombings in towns have become rare since the army pushed militants back from territory they controlled at the height of the conflict in 2014, though they still carry out attacks and ambushes in rural areas.
""This incident is very shocking,"" Borno senator for the ruling APC party Mohammed Ali Ndume told reporters. ""This is a wake up call for all of us in Borno State, that we should not be relaxed about security.""
""The story of suicide bombing had gone from Borno, but it's unfortunate it is rearing its ugly head again.""
On Saturday, Gwoza was the target of four almost simultaneous suicide attacks, including at least three perpetrated by female bombers, according to local emergency services. Dozens more were injured.
Suicide attacks, including by women, have always been part of the militants' armed struggle to establish a caliphate in the northeast of Africa's most populous country.
A witness said one of the women attackers had two children with her, though officials have not confirmed those details.
Boko Haram jihadists seized Gwoza in 2014 after taking over parts of Borno State.
The town was retaken by the Nigerian army with the help of Chadian forces in 2015, but jihadists still launch attacks from the mountains overlooking the town on the border with Cameroon.
Nigerian President Bola Ahmed Tinubu condemned the attacks in a statement on Sunday, saying the assault was a ""manifestation of pressure mounted against terrorists and the success in degrading their capacity"", and called it an ""isolated episode"".
When he came to power a year ago, the Nigerian leader said dealing with insecurity was one of the main challenges for his government.
Nigeria's armed forces are also fighting heavily armed kidnap gangs in the country's northwest and simmering separatist tensions in the southeast.

Police are investigating an incident where one person died following a fire incident in Kirinyaga County.
41-year-old James Nyaga died after an inferno razed his house in Mirichi village, located in Njuki-ini, Gichugu Constituency.
Police said the matter was reported by family members led by his mother Margaret Wakarii.
“The deceased was burnt beyond recognition as efforts to put out the fire bore no fruit,” the family said.
Further reports point to domestic issues between the deceased and his estranged wife who is said to have left her matrimonial home after a disagreement.
The body of the deceased was taken to Kerugoya Hospital mortuary as investigations continue.
“We urge police officers to conduct thorough investigations into the incident,” Peter Mugo, an elder, noted.

Naomi Osaka rapidly switched her focus to the Paris Olympics after a chastening early exit from Wimbledon on Wednesday at the hands of America's Emma Navarro.
The Japanese superstar, playing at the All England Club for the first time since 2019, went down 6-4, 6-1 in her second-round match on Centre Court in less than an hour.
The players were locked at 3-3 in the first set before the four-time Grand Slam champion lost her way.
Osaka admitted she had been short of confidence.
""Honestly, I feel like even though in the beginning it was kind of like we were trading games, I don't know why, I didn't feel fully confident in myself,"" she said.
""I didn't feel like I was playing that well. I guess, like, those doubts started trickling in a lot into my game. Obviously the second set wasn't that great.""
Navarro, 17th in the world rankings, broke to love in the seventh game and went on to take the first set.
She tightened the screw in the second set, breaking twice to race into a 4-0 lead and repeated the feat again to seal the match.
Osaka's win over Diane Parry in the opening round on Monday was her first at Wimbledon since 2018.
Now she is ranked at 113 having only returned to the tour in January after giving birth to one-year-old daughter Shai last year.
Osaka said she was not sure what her schedule would look like but said the Olympics in Paris, starting later this month, would be a priority.
She reached the third round of the Tokyo Games, held in 2021.
The tennis tournament in Paris is taking place on the clay courts of Roland Garros, where Osaka held a match point against eventual champion and world number one Iga Swiatek at the recent French Open.
""Since I'm out so early, I really want to take the time and train for the Olympics because I do want to do well,"" she said.
""I do know that my last clay court match was really good. So I might end up liking that surface a lot more than grass now.
""As far as the schedule, I don't really know too much yet. I think I'm just going to go home and, I guess, see what Shai is doing and then plan from there.""

https://www.citizen.digital/news/lewis-ngunyi-arrest-and-detention-of-nanyuki-protester-angers-kenyans-online-n345569,"Lewis Ngunyi: Arrest and detention of Nanyuki protester angers Kenyans online
Ngunyi was arrested on July 8 soon after presenting himself to the Nanyuki DCI officers. He had earlier shared several tweets which detailed the drama surrounding him and the DCI officers in Nanyuki who he claimed had, more than once, attempted to abduct him.
For instance, on July 7, Ngunyi shared that DCI officers had gone to the wrong home (that of his friend) mistaking it for his home. In the video attached, Ngunyi added that the officers interogated his friend's mother, who denied having a son named 'Lewis'.
""Okay, I may have jinxed things. Apparently, DCI officers in Nanyuki went to a friend's home yesterday (a case of mistaken identity I think) and were harassing his mum to produce me (she doesn't even know me). @DCI_Kenya if you want me, just summon me, I'll present myself!"" he wrote.
Soon after the video went viral, Ngunyi took to his X account to once again share his tribulations, saying that the officers had not located his actual home and were 'disturbing' his apartment's caretaker, asking him to produce the protester.
""There are @DCI_Kenya officers at my door disturbing my caretaker to produce me. You couldn't have summoned me during the day? I am not in the house,"" he wrote.
Later, he updated his followers, saying that he was OK but that he would present himself at the Nanyuki DCI offices to know what crime he had committed.
""For those asking, yes I'm alright. In a safe location. I will present myself at Nanyuki Police Station tomorrow in the company of advocates so that @DCI_Kenya can tell me why they're looking for me,"" he wrote.
Things, however, turned ugly after he arrived at the offices - he would then be quickly arrested and attempts by a battery of lawyers dislocated by the Law Society of Kenya to see him were rebuffed. The lawyers also claimed to have been harassed and assaulted by the police based at the Nanyuki Police Station.
One lawyer, going by the username Mercy Legal Inc. wrote, ""Imagine we’re still at the police station awaiting the police verdict over 4 hours later. Are they charging him of something? Are they not? We shall NOT allow impunity in this country. Our duty is to safeguard all peoples interest.""
She added, ""The advocates at Nanyuki waiting for the release of Lewis have been assaulted by the police in the Nanyuki Police station.""
While also narrating the chain of events leading to the arrest and detention, Ngunyi's friend Rogers, explained how, after arriving at the police station, the protester was interrogated for four hours, later leading to fracas and confusion.
He wrote: ""Upon presenting him, he was interrogated for 4 hours in the CCIO's office Nanyuki. Initially they interogated him without an advocate present. The intervention of other advocates and @LawSocietyofKe, one advocate was allowed in.""
""He, very cooperatively, issued a witness statement on the events leading to the Nanyuki demonstrations.
After which the officers and the State Counsel known as Musau received orders from ""above"" to book and detain Lewis.
""However, the DCI and the State counsel initially refused to disclose the charges to all the advocates present which led to fracas at the police station resulting to some advocates getting assaulted by police, me included. Note that the fracas was instigated by the police.
""The state counsel later disclosed the charges levelled against Lewis and they include: arson, shop breaking and malicious damage to property. Tomorrow he will be presented before Nanyuki Law Courts at 9.00am.""
After Ngunyi's case reverberated across the internet, Kenyans on X have now joined hands in agitating for his immediate release, some have already designed posters calling for his freedom.
""Ruto wants to negotiate with young Kenyans but his regime is still abducting, killing and detaining Kenyans illegally. How can we dialogue when the likes of Lewis Ngunyi still cannot find justice in their own land?"" one Kenyan on X asked.
John Kiongo, on his part, said, ""Coming back to this again. A reminder that Ngunyi's pinned tweet is literally a letter he submitted to the Nanyuki OCS outlining his intention to carry out a peaceful march within Nanyuki. We cannot allow these charges to stand. #FreeLewis!""
According to Mercy Legal Inc., Ngunyi was to be produced in court on Wednesday, July 10 at 9am. There are no updates yet on the developments on the matter.

Top Kenyan coaches; Francis Kimanzi and Twahir Muhiddin are
convinced that Kenya has a big chance to qualify for the 2025 African Cup of
Nations following Thursday’s draw by the Confederation of African Football for
the qualifiers.
Kenya is in group J alongside five-time champions Cameroon,
Zimbabwe and Namibia, and the two former Harambee Stars coaches believe with
proper planning, the team will qualify for the fiesta to be staged in Morocco.
Muhiddin particularly noted Kenya’s recent performances against
top African teams, including their last 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier against
African Champions Ivory Coast in Malawi, which ended in a 0-0 draw.
""The team is showing great promise, and I firmly believe
they have the ability to compete and triumph against any opponent in Africa.
The important element is good preparations, sometimes the difference of making
it and failing is so small,"" said Muhiddin.
Kimanzi says that the African football landscape is fast
changing, and there are no small teams anymore, cautioning against underestimating
Zimbabwe and Namibia.
""Every game in this group will be crucial. We must approach
each match with the determination and focus of a final. Qualification is all
about ambition. If you have ambition and you want to do it, you can do it. But ambitions means preparing well, analyzing the group in detail and work on our
strengths,"" Kimanzi said.
However, Muhiddin raised concerns about hosting home matches, warning that a lack FIFA approved stadia could derail the team. At the publishing of this account, Kenya had no such stadium, with the Moi International Centre Kasarani and Nyayo National Stadium closed for upgrading.
""Playing at home provides a significant advantage with the
support of our fans. I urge the government to fast track stadium construction
and renovations to ensure our team can compete on home turf,"" Muhiddin
pleaded.
In June, Harambee Stars hosted her World Cup qualifiers in Malawi, against Burundi and Ivory coast much to the chagrin of the fans. Head coach Engine Firat also lamented playing home matches away from home dealt his boys a huge blow, remarks echoed by Captain Michael Olunga in separate interviews.
Harambee Stars are aiming to make a return to the African Cup of
Nations after a six-year absence.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/could-kamala-harris-beat-donald-trump-in-novembers-presidential-race-n345396,"Could Kamala Harris beat Donald Trump in November's presidential race?
Vice President Kamala Harris would be President Joe Biden's natural successor if he bowed to growing pressure and stepped aside as the Democratic candidate in the 2024 election, top Democrats say.
Now party donors, activists and officials are asking: Does she have a better chance than Biden of beating Donald Trump? Biden has said repeatedly he is staying in the race.
Harris, 59, a former U.S. senator and California attorney general, would be the first woman to be president of the United States if she becomes the party's nominee and prevails in the Nov. 5 election. She is the first African American and Asian person to serve as vice president.
Her 3-1/2 year White House tenure has been characterized by a lackluster start, staff turnover, and early policy portfolios including migration from Central America that did not produce major successes.
As recently as last year, many inside the White House and the Biden campaign team privately worried Harris was a liability for the campaign. The situation has changed significantly since then, Democratic officials have said, as she stepped forward on abortion rights and courted young voters.
She ""is proud to be his running mate and looks forward to serving at his side for four more years,"" the Biden Harris campaign told Reuters.
SOME POLLS FAVOR HARRIS
Recent polls suggest Harris could do better than Biden against Trump, the Republican candidate, although she would face a tight contest.
A CNN poll released on July 2 found voters favor Trump over Biden by six percentage points, or 49% to 43%. Harris also trailed Trump, 47% to 45%, within the margin of error.
It also found independents back Harris 43%-40% over Trump, and moderate voters of both parties prefer her 51-39%.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll after last week's televised debate between Trump and a faltering Biden found Harris and Trump were nearly tied, with 42% supporting her and 43% backing him.
Only former first lady Michelle Obama, who has never expressed any interest in joining the race, polled higher among possible alternatives to Biden.
Internal polling shared by the Biden campaign after the debate shows Harris with the same odds as Biden of beating Trump, with 45% of voters saying they would vote for her versus 48% for Trump.
Influential Democrats including U.S. Representative Jim Clyburn, who was key to Biden's 2020 win; Rep. Gregory Meeks, a New York congressman and senior member of the Congressional Black Caucus; and Summer Lee, a House Democrat from Pennsylvania have signaled Harris would be the best option to lead the ticket if Biden chooses to step aside.
House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has also privately signaled the same to lawmakers, a Congressional aide said.
Harris is taken so seriously, two Republican donors told Reuters they would prefer for Trump to face Biden than her.
""I would prefer Biden to stay in place"", rather than be replaced by Harris, said Pauline Lee, a fundraiser for Trump in Nevada after the June 27 debate, who said she thought Biden had proved himself to be ""incompetent.""
And some on Wall Street, an important Democratic fundraising center, are starting to indicate a preference.
""Biden is already behind Trump, and is unlikely to be able to overcome that gap given where his campaign is currently. Having VP Harris likely improves Democrats' odds of taking the White House,"" said Sonu Varghese, global macro strategist at Carson Group, a financial services company, after the debate. ""There's potentially more upside for her chances than Biden's at this point.""
A majority of Americans see Harris in a negative light, as they do both men running for president.
Polling outlet Five Thirty Eight said 37.1% of voters approve of Harris and 49.6% disapprove. Those numbers compare to 36.9% and 57.1% for Biden, and 38.6% and 53.6% for Trump.
WOMEN, BLACK VOTERS, GAZA
Since the Supreme Court repealed women's constitutional right to abortion in 2022, Harris has become the Biden administration's foremost voice on reproductive rights, an issue Democrats are betting on to help them win the 2024 election.
Some Democrats believe Harris could energize Democratic-leaning groups whose enthusiasm for Biden has faded, including Black voters, young voters and those who do not approve of Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war.
""She would energize the Black, brown, and Asian Pacific members of our coalition ... she would immediately pull the dispirited youth of our country back into the fold,"" said Tim Ryan, a former Democratic Congressman from Ohio, in a recent op-ed.
Democratic and Republican suburban women may also be more comfortable with her then Trump or Biden, he said.
As vice president, Harris's public Israel strategy is identical to Biden's, although she was the first senior leader of the U.S. government to call for a ceasefire in March.
""Simply swapping out the candidate does not address the central concern"" of the movement, said Abbas Alawieh, a member of the national ""Uncommitted"" movement that withheld votes for Biden in the primary based on his support of Israel.
If Biden were to step aside, there could be a competition between other Democrats to become the nominee.
If the party were then to choose another candidate over Harris, some Democrats say it could lose the support of many Black voters who were critical to Biden's election win in 2020.
""There is no alternative besides Kamala Harris,"" said Adrianne Shropshire, executive director of Black voter outreach group BlackPAC.
""If the Democratic Party thinks that they have problems now with their base being confused ... Jump over the Black woman, the vice president, and I don't think the Democratic Party actually recovers.""
LEFT-LEANING, TARGETED ATTACKS
However, Harris may struggle to reel in moderate Democrats and the independent voters who like Biden's centrist policies, some Democratic donors said. Both parties seek independents to help pull them over the finishing line in presidential elections.
""Her greatest weakness is that her public brand has been associated with the far-left wing of the Democratic Party ... and the left wing of the Democratic party cannot win a national election,"" said Dmitri Mehlhorn, a fundraiser and adviser to LinkedIn co-founder and Democratic megadonor Reid Hoffman. ""That is the challenge that she will have to overcome if she is the nominee.""
Harris would take over money raised by the Biden campaign and inherit campaign infrastructure, a critical advantage with just four months before election day on Nov. 5.
But any Democratic campaign still needs to raise hundreds of millions of dollars more before November to be successful, strategists say. And there, Harris could be a liability.
""I can tell you we have a really tough time raising money for her"" said a source at the Democratic National Committee.
As a presidential candidate ahead of the 2020 election, Harris lagged Biden in raising money. She dropped out of the race in December 2019, the same month her campaign reported $39.3 million in total contributions. Biden's campaign reported $60.9 million in the same period.
However, Biden's campaign raised a record $48 million in the 24 hours after he named Harris as his running mate in 2020.
Harris's prosecutorial background could shine in a head-to-head debate against Trump, some Democrats said.
""She is incredibly focused and forceful and smart, and if she prosecutes the case against the criminality of Donald Trump, she will rip him apart,"" said Mehlhorn.
Republican attacks on Harris are ramping up as she has been floated as a possible Biden replacement. Conservative talking heads are re-circulating criticism leveled at her during the 2020 race, including from some Democrats, that Harris laughs too much, that she is untested, and unqualified.
On July 6 the New York Post, owned by the conservative News Corp, ran a column headlined ""America may soon be subjected to the country’s first DEI president: Kamala Harris,"" that said her political rise was because of her party's diversity, equity and inclusion ""stranglehold.""
Kelly Dittmar, a political science professor at Rutgers University, said the attacks are part of a long history of objectifying and denigrating women of color in politics.
""Unfortunately the reliance on both racist and sexist attacks and tropes against women running for office is historically common and persists to this day,"" said Dittmar.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/biden-digs-in-as-pressure-from-fellow-democrats-escalates-n345361,"Some Democratic House lawmakers are circulating two separate letters calling for Biden to step aside, House Democratic sources have said. Many of those lawmakers had been waiting to see the ABC News interview before moving forward.
House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries scheduled a virtual meeting on Sunday with senior House Democrats to discuss Biden’s candidacy and the path forward.
U.S. Representative Lloyd Doggett of Texas, who had previously called on Biden to step aside, told CNN after the ABC interview, ""Every day (Biden) delays makes it more difficult for a new person to come on board to defeat Donald Trump.""
Meanwhile on the Senate side, U.S. Senator Mark Warner was contacting some fellow Democratic senators to invite them to a possible meeting on Monday to discuss Biden's campaign.
Biden spent Saturday at his home in Delaware, with no public events on his schedule, although he attended an evening church service. Sunday will be a busy day for him, with two Pennsylvania campaign events in Philadelphia and Harrisburg.
At a campaign rally in Madison, Wisconsin on Friday, Biden vowed to stay in the race.
""I am running and gonna win again,"" Biden told supporters.
Some polls show Trump's lead over Biden widening, and Democrats worry concerns about the president could weigh on down-ballot races.
But Biden registered his best showing yet in a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult tracking poll of battleground states, with Trump leading Biden by only 2 percentage points, 47% to 45%, in the critical states needed to win the November election.
One bright spot for Biden came early Saturday, when the Palestinian militant group Hamas accepted a U.S. proposal to begin talks on releasing Israeli hostages, including soldiers and men, a move that could pave the way for a ceasefire to end the nine-month-old war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.
Vice President Kamala Harris, the top choice to replace Biden if he were to step aside as the Democratic Party's standard-bearer, spoke in New Orleans at the Essence Festival of Culture, an annual culture and music festival sponsored by Essence magazine, whose target audience is Black women.
Harris attacked former President Donald Trump and the US Supreme Court for taking away abortion rights. The appearance was part of an effort by the Biden campaign to shore up support among Black voters.
Harris on Friday posted a supportive note on X after Biden's rally in Madison, saying the president had devoted his life to fighting for Americans. ""In this moment, I know all of us are ready to fight for him,"" she said.
Margaret Washa, 75, a retired physical therapist from Middleton, Wisconsin, saw Biden at the Madison rally and thought he looked more vigorous, but grew dismayed after watching the interview.
""It's starting to be about him and whether he can do it, and rather than about what's best for our nation, and about turning over leadership to the next generation,"" she said. ""It's time to pass the baton. There are so many good, strong, younger, intelligent, more charismatic Democrats out there.""

https://www.citizen.digital/news/cameroon-nigeria-agree-to-end-border-dispute-n344889,"Cameroon, Nigeria agree to end border dispute
Nigeria and Cameroon said Thursday they would
no longer seek a court ruling to settle their disputed border.
Rather, the two nations said, joint
delegations will validate a demarcation plan on site and put an end to
long-standing territorial disputes.
The nations share about 2,100 kilometers
(1,300 miles) of border, from Lake Chad in the north of the Gulf of Guinea to
the Atlantic Ocean coast.
Leonardo Santos Simao, chairperson of the
Cameroon-Nigeria Mixed Commission set up by the United Nations to solve the
countries’ territorial disputes, said he is delighted the two countries decided
to resolve their disputes without long and expensive processes at the
International Court of Justice.
The agreement to peacefully resolve border
disputes before the end of 2025 was made at a meeting of the Mixed Commission
on Wednesday and Thursday in Yaounde. Simao called it a milestone.
The two countries agreed to visit disputed
territories in Rumsiki and Tourou in northern Cameroon and Koche in eastern
Nigeria before the end of 2024.
Nigerian Justice Minister Lateef Olasunkanmi
Fagbemi, who is the leader of the West African state's delegation to the
Cameroon-Nigeria Mixed Commission, confirmed that the countries have agreed to
complete the project within 12 months.
""It's a consensus between Cameroon and
Nigeria. By the end of 2025, this project should be concluded,” he said. “We have
so admirably and maturely handled the situation in such a way that there is
hardly any dissent. We are satisfied with the outcome of the two-day meeting,
and we are hopeful that there is light at the end of the tunnel.""
Cameroon and Nigeria say the border
demarcation was slowed by Boko Haram terrorism in both countries. They say that
the Boko Haram group’s firepower is drastically reduced now and that the
demarcation can continue.
The two states say they will move past
existing differences over the precise location of the border in about 30
villages.
The Cameroon-Nigeria Mixed Commission was
established in 2002 at the request of President Paul Biya of Cameroon and the
then-Nigerian leader Olusegun Obasanjo to facilitate the implementation of an
October 10, 2002, International Court of Justice ruling that ceded Bakassi, an
oil-rich border peninsula, to Cameroon.
Nigeria initially rejected the verdict, with
its senate arguing that the ruling, based on a colonial era agreement, was
unfair and should be appealed. But Nigerian officials said the verdict should
be respected.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/wikileaks-founder-assange-welcomed-home-in-australia-a-free-man-after-us-deal-n344742,"WikiLeaks founder Assange welcomed home in Australia a free man after US deal
Assange disembarked from a private jet at Canberra airport just after 7:30 p.m. (0930 GMT), waving to waiting media and cheering supporters before passionately kissing his wife, Stella, and lifting her off the ground.
He embraced his father before entering the terminal building with his legal team.
Assange has not spoken publicly since being released and did not appear at a Wikileaks press conference at a hotel in Canberra, where Stella Assange said it was too soon to say what her husband would do next.
""Julian needs time to recover, to get used to freedom,"" she said. ""I want Julian to have that space to rediscover that freedom.""
She added she believed her husband would one day be pardoned.
Australia Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who has lobbied for years to free Assange, said he had spoken to him by phone after his plane landed.
""I had a very warm discussion with him this evening, he was very generous in his praise of the Australian government's efforts,"" Albanese told an earlier press conference.
""The Australian government stands up for Australian citizens, that's what we do.""
Assange's arrival ends a saga in which he spent more than five years in a British high-security jail and seven years in asylum at the Ecuadorean embassy in London battling extradition to Sweden on sexual assault allegations and to the U.S., where he faced 18 criminal charges.
Those charges stemmed from WikiLeaks' release in 2010 of hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. military documents on Washington's wars in Afghanistan and Iraq - one of the largest breaches of secret information in U.S. history.
During a three-hour hearing held earlier in the U.S. territory of Saipan, Assange pleaded guilty to one criminal count of conspiring to obtain and disclose classified national defence documents but said he had believed the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment, which protects free speech, shielded his activities.
""Working as a journalist I encouraged my source to provide information that was said to be classified in order to publish that information,"" he told the court.
""I believed the First Amendment protected that activity but I accept that it was...a violation of the espionage statute.""
Chief U.S. District Judge Ramona V. Manglona accepted his guilty plea, noting that the U.S. government indicated there was no personal victim from Assange's actions.
She wished Assange, who turns 53 on July 3, an early happy birthday as she released him due to time already served in a British jail.
HAILED AS HERO
While the U.S. government viewed Assange as reckless for putting its agents at risk of harm by publishing their names, his supporters hailed him as a hero for promoting free speech and exposing war crimes.
""We firmly believe that Mr. Assange never should have been charged under the Espionage Act and engaged in (an) exercise that journalists engage in every day,"" his U.S. lawyer, Barry Pollack, told reporters outside the court.
He said WikiLeaks' work would continue.
Assange's British and Australian lawyer Jennifer Robinson thanked the Australian government for securing Assange's release. His father, John Shipton, told Reuters he was relieved.
""That Julian can come home to Australia and see his family regularly and do the ordinary things of life is a treasure,"" Shipton said in Canberra, where he was waiting for his son.
""The beauty of the ordinary is the essence of life.""
Assange had agreed to plead guilty to a single criminal count, according to filings in the U.S. District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands.
The U.S. territory in the western Pacific was chosen due to his opposition to travelling to the mainland U.S. and for its proximity to Australia, prosecutors said.
Politicians in Australia who had campaigned for his release raised concern about the guilty plea on U.S. soil, saying he was a journalist who had been convicted for doing his job.
""That is a really alarming precedent. It is the sort of thing we'd expect in an authoritarian or totalitarian country,"" said Andrew Wilkie, an independent lawmaker who led a parliamentary group advocating for Assange.
Assange spent more than five years in what Judge Manglona called one of Britain's harshest prisons and seven years holed up in the Ecuadorean embassy in London as he fought extradition.
While stuck at the embassy he had two sons with Stella, who had been one of his lawyers. They married in 2022 at Belmarsh prison in London.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/lebanons-hezbollah-rains-200-rockets-on-israel-as-gaza-war-rages-n345233,"Lebanon's Hezbollah rains 200 rockets on Israel as Gaza war rages
The Iran-backed militant group said its latest attack, which followed over 100 rockets fired the previous day, came in response to Israel's killing of a senior Hezbollah commander in south Lebanon.
Israel reported no deaths in its northern border area, where most communities have been evacuated, but quickly said it had responded with strikes in southern Lebanon.
Israel and Hezbollah, an ally of the Palestinian militant group Hamas, have exchanged near daily cross-border fire since the Gaza war erupted on October 7, stoking fears of an escalation into all-out war.
UN chief Antonio Guterres voiced concern Wednesday ""about the escalation of the exchange of fire"", his spokesman Stephane Dujarric said, warning of the risk to the wider Middle East ""if we were to find ourselves in a full-fledged conflict"".
Hezbollah and Hamas are part of an Iran-led ""Axis of Resistance"" against Israel and the United States, a regional alliance that also includes Yemen's Huthi rebels and armed groups in Iraq and Syria.
The Israeli military confirmed Hezbollah's claims that over 200 rockets were launched on Thursday and said that its forces were ""striking launch posts in southern Lebanon"" in response.
Israeli air defences intercepted most incoming rockets, and the only reported casualty was a man slightly wounded by shrapnel, while some of the impacts sparked wildfires.
Israel killed senior Hezbollah commander Mohammed Naameh Nasser with a strike in the Lebanese coastal city of Tyre on Wednesday.
A source close to the group described him as ""responsible for one of three sectors in south Lebanon"". His death came after an Israeli strike in June killed Taleb Abdallah, who headed another sector.
Speaking at Nasser's funeral, top Hezbollah official Hashem Safieddine warned Israel against ""imagining that targeting these heroes would ever leave the south exposed"".
""When any leader becomes a martyr, another takes up the banner and proceeds with new, firm and strong resolve.""
- Heavy battles rock Gaza -
The Gaza war broke out after Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.
The militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza including 42 the army says are dead.
Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 38,011 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.
The Israel-Hezbollah border clashes have killed at least 496 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also including 95 civilians, according to an AFP tally.
Israeli authorities say at least 15 soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed on their side of the UN-patrolled border.
The Gaza war at the heart of the tensions has meanwhile raged on, and gun battles, air strikes and shelling rocked Gaza City for an eight-day on Thursday.
Israeli troops ""destroyed tunnel routes in the area and eliminated dozens of terrorists in close-quarters combat with tank fire, and in aerial strikes,"" the military said.
Gaza's civil defence agency said at least five people were killed in a strike that hit a Gaza City school.
Fears of renewed heavy fighting have also surged in southern areas near Khan Yunis and Rafah after the military on Monday issued a sweeping evacuation order that the UN said impacted 250,000 people.
- Efforts towards truce -
Israel has faced an international outcry over the soaring civilian death toll, punishing siege and mass destruction in Gaza.
The UN humanitarian coordinator for Gaza, Sigrid Kaag, this week called for an end to the ""maelstrom of human misery"".
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted Israel will destroy Hamas and bring home the remaining hostages.
US President Joe Biden, under growing domestic pressure over Washington's support for Israel, in late May outlined a roadmap for a six-week truce and exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners.
There has been little progress since, but Hamas said Wednesday it was communicating with officials in Qatar and Egypt as well as Turkey with an eye to ending the conflict.
Hamas said its Qatar-based political chief Ismail Haniyeh had ""made contact with the mediator brothers in Qatar and Egypt about the ideas that the movement is discussing with them with the aim of reaching an agreement"".
Netanyahu's office said Wednesday that ""Israel is evaluating the (Hamas) remarks and will convey its reply to the mediators"".
The main stumbling block so far has centred on Hamas's demand for a permanent end to the fighting, which Netanyahu and his far-right coalition partners strongly reject.

Kenya's Faith Kipyegon delivered a stunning
performance at the Paris Diamond League meet on Sunday, breaking her own world
record in the women's 1500m.
With the help of two pacemakers, Kipyegon
surged to the front, clocking an impressive 3: 49.04; which is 0.07 seconds
faster than her previous best set in Florence, in June 2023.
The feat comes as a timely boost for the
double Olympic champion ahead of the Paris Olympics later this month.
Australia’s Jessica Hull timed a personal best
of 3:50.83 to finish second, while Great Britain’s Laura Muir clocked a
personal best of 3:53.79 to take the third spot.
Kipyegon began her season in dominant fashion
at the Olympic trials, effortlessly qualifying for the Games with a blistering
3:53.98 at the high-altitude Nairobi's Nyayo National Stadium.
At 30 years, Kipyegon returns to Paris as one
of the top contenders for Olympic gold. She is already a double Olympic
champion in the 1,500m and holds three world titles in the same event.
In addition to her distance of super prowess
1,500m, Kipyegon will also compete in the 5000m, as she did at the Budapest
World Championships last year.
At the same time, reigning World 800m silver
medallist Emmanuel Wanyonyi made a significant impact at the Paris Diamond
League, settling for second in a photo finish against Algeria's Sedjati Djamel.
Wanyonyi achieved a personal best of 1:41.58,
just behind Sedjati, who clocked a world-leading time of 1:41.56 – the
third-fastest time ever recorded for the event.
Wanyonyi's remarkable performance in Paris
comes just over three weeks after he posted a time of 1:41.70 at the national
trials in Nairobi, securing his place in the upcoming Olympics, also set to be
held in Paris.
Only David Rudisha, with a time of 1:40.91,
and Wilson Kipketer, with 1:41.11, have run faster in the two-lap race.
Frenchman Gabriel Tual took third place with a
time of 1:41.61, narrowly beating another Kenyan, Aaron Kemei, who finished
fourth with a time of 1:42.08.
Commonwealth Games champion Wycliffe Kinyamal
closely followed in fifth, also clocking 1:42.08.

Kenya Prisons sensational attacker Meldina Sande, DCI's outside hitter Jemimah Siang'u, and KCB's libero Lincy Jeruto have been dropped from Malkia Strikers final squad for the 2024 Paris Olympic games.
The three were part of the Malkia Strikers squad that lost 3-0 to Puerto Rico in the quarterfinals of the Challenger Cup last week in the Philippines and were not lucky to be in Japheth Munala’s final squad.
Although not yet back at her top form yet, Chepchumba has done well to shake off a knee injury that threatened to scatter her Olympic debut dream.
The 25-year-old has been Malkia Strikers' most valuable player in the past three years, and her absence in the attack was felt when Malkia Strikers lost 3-2 to Egypt in the African Games' semi-final earlier this year.
Kenya Pipeline's Leonidas Kasaya is the only player from the squad who will be making her second appearance at the Olympics after featuring in 2020's Tokyo Olympic Games.
The 13-member squad will be captained by Kenya Pipeline's middle blocker, Trizah Atuka, who took over the armband from Mercy Moim, who remains away from the national team.
Trizah will be assisted by Edith Wisa, who is the captain of the KCB volleyball club.
Atuka, former Lugulu Girls alumnus, will be hoping to captain the ten-time African champions to their first win in the Olympic games this summer after failing to do so in their last two Olympic encounters.
The 32-year-old Malkia Strikers regular saw her 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games debut vanish into thin air after suffering an injury and has since risen to become indispensable in the national team.
Malkia Strikers will leave the country this week for a two-week high-performance training in Miramas before heading to Paris for the Olympic games that kick off on 26th July.
Malkia Strikers are
seeded in pool B alongside two-time Olympic champions Brazil and Japan and two-time Olympic bronze medalists Poland.

According to communication from Felix Koskei, the Head of Public Service, on Wednesday, the framework is an interim administrative state intervention until a law allowing structured, transparent contributions for public and charitable purposes is passed.
""All the Service Commissions (Public Service Commission, Parliamentary Service Commission, Judicial Service Commission, Teachers Service Commission and Police Service Commission) in collaboration with the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC), will establish an institutional framework ot monitor compliance with this new government policy,"" a memo addressed to all government units reads in part.
To enforce this directive, all public officers must maintain the highest ethical standards and ensure compliance among those under their supervision.
According to Koskei, the development will ensure that the spirit of Harambee continues to propel its noble ideals while addressing concerns about accountability and ethical conduct in the public sector.
In late June, President Ruto promised to address the opulence and extravagance displayed by some state officials, particularly Cabinet Secretaries and MPs.
The president was responding to concerns about a group of government officials walking around in flashy clothes and carrying wads of cash to harambees.
He also revealed that he has spoken with UDA MPs, who are considering doing away with harambees, particularly in churches.
""We are actually going to do away with harambees, because when a junior state officers donates Ksh20 million in a harambee, there is something fundamentally wrong. That is wrong,"" Ruto asserted.
Concerns have been raised about MPs like Kapseret's Oscar Sudi distributing millions of shillings in church harambees.

https://www.citizen.digital/opinion-blogs/opinion-unlocking-food-security-smallholder-farmers-and-digital-innovation-key-amidst-growing-population-n344978,"OPINION: Unlocking Food Security - Smallholder farmers and digital innovation key amidst growing population
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), food security is defined as ensuring that all individuals have consistent access to safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and preferences.
Recent reports from the World Food Programme (WFP) underscore the gravity of the situation, revealing that over 780 million people, approximately 1 in 10 of the world's population, struggle with chronic hunger.
This crisis is worsened by complex challenges such as climate change and the relentless rise in global population, projected to reach approximately 10 billion by the year 2050.
These alarming statistics paint a glaring reality, serving as an upsetting reminder for all stakeholders to urgently address this pressing issue.
In response, in 2015 the United Nations called upon member states to commit to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, with SDG 2 focusing on Zero Hunger – aiming to eradicate hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture.
This commitment demands a collective effort involving governments, non-governmental organizations, and the private sector at large. Recognizing the urgency for action, Bayer has embarked on a mission to combat food insecurity pegged on its mission, 'Health for All, Hunger for None'.
Smallholder farmers stand as the unsung heroes silently feeding nations and sustaining livelihoods in the face of monumental challenges.
The number of smallholder farmers currently stands at approximately 33 million across Africa, with over 2 billion people globally reliant on their produce. In Kenya alone, they are 7.5 million and they account for 80% of the country's total agricultural output further highlighting their pivotal role in achieving food security.
With the world's population swelling and urbanization accelerating, the pressure on the smallholder farmers to increase productivity and ensure food security has never been more pronounced. This requires scaling their subsistence farming practices.
In the face of shifting weather patterns and the endeavor to achieve zero hunger, Bayer is equipping smallholder farmers with climate-resistant seeds tailored for diverse climatic conditions, backed by robust research and development.
These seeds offer a guarantee of high yields on limited land, with the planting cycle encompassing soil testing, land preparation, and safe application of pesticides and fertilizers. Bayer's has deployed field representatives who play a pivotal role in disseminating this knowledge to farmers, ensuring effective implementation.
Moreover, Bayer has established Centers of Excellence in various regions in Kenya, serving as hubs for educating farmers on sustainable practices.
These centers boast expert agronomists who provide insights on seeds, product safety, and other pertinent farming techniques. Additionally, Bayer collaborates with farmers to promote sustainable practices such as drip irrigation, particularly in areas prone to extreme heat, thereby enhancing water efficiency and crop resilience.
A key pillar for sustainable smallholder farming is digital innovation. In recent years, the fusion of agriculture with digital technology has ushered in a new era of possibilities for smallholder farmers. Bayer, a steadfast advocate for agricultural progress, recognizes the pivotal role of digital solutions in transforming the landscape of food production.
By leveraging digital tools and platforms, smallholder farmers can overcome traditional constraints and unlock their full potential as key contributors to global food security.
There still remains a lot that can be done in this space. The realization of this digital agricultural revolution pivots on concerted efforts from all stakeholders.
Governments must prioritize investments in digital infrastructure and policies that foster innovation and entrepreneurship in the agricultural sector. Private sector entities have a responsibility to develop and disseminate user-friendly digital solutions tailored to the unique needs of smallholder farmers.
The journey towards zero hunger demands intensive efforts from governments, private enterprises, and smallholder farmers alike.
Embracing innovative farming practices is paramount, aiming for high yields that are both abundant and nutritious. In today's digital age, the dissemination of information on best practices and tested methods around the globe has become easier than ever, hence why all should embrace it as a key driver towards realizing food security.
In conclusion, smallholder farmers are the backbone of global food security, and digital innovation represents a cornerstone in their empowerment.
By harnessing the transformative potential of digital technologies, we can amplify the resilience, productivity, and sustainability of smallholder agriculture, safeguarding the well-being of present and future generations.
By empowering smallholder farmers and fostering collaboration across sectors, Bayer embodies a proactive approach towards achieving SDG 2 and ensuring a food- secure future for generations to come.

Germany winger Leroy Sane said his side could ""hurt"" Spain in Friday's Euro 2024 quarter final, thanks to the impressive return of midfielder Toni Kroos.
Sane started from the bench in all three of Germany's pool games but returned to the starting line-up at the expense of Florian Wirtz in Saturday's last 16 win over Denmark.
With pre-tournament favourites England and France struggling despite reaching the quarter finals, Spain have emerged alongside hosts Germany as favourites for the tournament.
The only side to win all four of their games, Spain are the form team of the tournament, having scored nine goals and conceded just one.
Sane said Germany and Spain had ""played the best football"" of the tournament.
""We need to keep control of our game, then we can hurt the Spaniards.""
Both Spain and Germany each have three Euros titles -- more than any other team.
Germany lost 6-0 to Spain in the Nations League in 2020, during a desperately poor period.
After winning the 2014 World Cup and reaching the semi-finals of Euro 2016, Germany were eliminated at the group stage of the past two World Cups and lost to England in the last 16 of the Euros in 2021.
""The heavy defeat hurt a lot, but that's in the past,"" Sane, who started that match in Seville, told reporters.
The 28-year-old Bayern Munich winger said 2014 World Cup winner Kroos, who returned to the national team in the lead up to Euro 2024 having retired from international football three years prior, had given Germany control again.
""Before we weren't always stable enough, that was a big weakness of ours.
""He took away that weakness with the calmness he brings with him. Now things are going well and we're happy he's come back and made us stronger.""
Handed his first Germany start of 2024, Sane struggled for rhythm against Denmark but provided speed running behind the lines.
The former Manchester City winger said ""it is still not clear whether I will start or not,"" but the team's trust in coach Julian Nagelsmann's decisions ""is what makes us special"".
Midfielder Emre Can was the only member of Germany's 26-man squad not to train on Tuesday, but the federation said his omission was just a precaution.
Antonio Rudiger, Manuel Neuer and Pascal Gross completed the training session despite carrying niggling injuries.

the only way to end oppressive taxes, such as the housing levy, and to combat
corruption and budgetary excesses.
“They have carried the struggle of Saba Saba,
we want them to know Azimio stands with them,” said the Wiper leader.
“Tunashukuru hawa vijana wanaitaka serkali
iwajibike,” added Munya.
The opposition criticised President Ruto's recently
formed Public Debt Audit Taskforce, terming it illegal and unconstitutional.
They reiterated that the office of the Auditor-General
is the rightful entity for such audits and told the president to stop using
superficial task forces to mislead Kenyans.
“The task force is unconstitutional; those
appointed would have taken note. Cosmetic changes will not do,” said Musyoka.
This comes shortly after the Law Society president,
Faith Odihambo, declined an appointment to the task force.
Azimio warned that protests would continue
until all issues raised by Kenyans, including the high cost of living and
reforming IEBC, are addressed.
They called on Kenyans to persist in their
pursuit of change and to completely eradicate what they termed as a corrupt
regime.
Saba Saba, meaning ""July 7th"" in Swahili,
commemorates a significant historical event in Kenya's struggle for democracy.
It marks the day in 1990 when pro-democracy
activists rallied at Kamukunji Grounds to demand multi-party democracy,
challenging the then one-party rule.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/odm-to-recall-six-mps-for-voting-to-pass-finance-bill-2024-n345058,"ODM to recall six MPs for voting to pass Finance Bill 2024
The Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) now says it will initiate
and lead recall processes for six Members of Parliament elected on the party
ticket.
The MPs on the chopping block and the various constituencies
they represent are; Gem (Elisha Odhiambo), Bondo (Gideon Ochanda), Navakholo (Emmanuel
Wangwe), Kajiado Central (Elijah Kanchory), Ikolomani (Bernard Shinali), and
Suba South (Caroli Omondi).
Addressing journalists after a Central Committee meeting in
Nairobi on Tuesday, ODM Secretary General and Nairobi Senator Edwin Sifuna
highlighted that the MPs disregarded their oaths of office by not considering
the wishes of their constituents before voting on the now withdrawn Finance
Bill, 2024.
""ODM shall initiate and lead recall processes in the
following constituencies in light of the current office holders repeated
violation of their sacred oath and the wishes of their electorate. They are;
Gem, Bondo, Navakholo, Kajiado central, Ikolomani and Suba South,"" said
Sifuna.
Sifuna also commented on the recent incident where protesters
stormed Parliament, interpreting it as a vote of No confidence in the Kenya
Kwanza administration.
He further called on the President William Ruto-led government
to wake up and smell the coffee, and heed to the demands of the Kenyan people.
""In our view what happened on June 25, 2024, amounted to
a vote of No confidence in the Ruto regime; it is clear that this fact is
totally lost on Ruto and it is reflected in his petulant proposals on how we
manage our economy following the rejection of the tax Bill,"" said the
Senator.
""Instead of focusing on cutting wastage, opulence and
corruption in his regime, he is hitting back at the Kenyan people with threats
to cut funding for the Judiciary and county governments.""
The ODM Secretary General also condemned the excessive use of
force by police to disperse demonstrators and condemned reported cases of
police abductions of protesters.
""We condemn the abuse of police power in the deployment
of violent suppression techniques on innocent and unarmed protesters. we
further condemn the ongoing arbitrary abductions of innocent Kenyans who are
carted away in the most violent and inhumane manner and held incommunicado for
days,"" said Sifuna.
""The Head of State has tried to distance his regime from
its killings, injuries and abductions, instead conjuring up theories when
everybody can see the blood on his hands. We have the most callous, insensitive
and obtuse regime in the history of Kenya. It is no wonder chants of ‘Ruto must
go’ are ringing out all across our land.""
Sifuna, while criticizing President Ruto for downplaying the
severity of the protests, likewise urged the Kenya Kwanza administration to
take full responsibility for the deaths, injuries and property damage recorded
during the demonstrations.
According to the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights
(KNCHR), 39 people have been killed while a further 361 have been injured in
the protests between June 18 to July 1, 2024
""We were shocked to see the President claiming on Live TV
that only one life was lost; it tells you how out of touch with reality he is.
The Kenya Kwanza regime must take full responsibility for all the deaths,
injuries and destruction of property arising from the violent suppression of
peaceful protests,"" noted the Senator.
""The President must publicly direct his security organs
to forthwith cease the ongoing abductions; an exercise we believe is being
undertaken by his full approval and that of the State. He must account for and
order the release of all the detainees abducted by security agencies.""
Furthermore, the opposition party called on the Independent
Policing and Oversight Authority (IPOA) to swiftly investigate allegations of
police brutality during the demonstrations.
""IPOA must expedite investigations into all these
incidents including allegations of mass murder by police in Githurai and
Rongai,"" said Sifuna.

They took to the streets on Wednesday to protest, accusing security officers and the chief of laxity in dealing with culprits.
The group lamented that many locals’ lives were wasting away because of addiction to the illicit brew, adding that several people have died after consuming the alcohol, while youths have turned to crime and are no longer productive members of the community.
Families have complained of breadwinners using the little money they earn to buy the illicit brew, while abandoning their duties.
Residents have warned that they will take legal action against the culprits if security officials do not arrest them.
Bernard Terer, a resident, said, “We cannot sit back and watch these people (illicit brew makers) destroy our families. We have come out to protest against this vice which is destroying families.”
Another resident, Esther Korir, who is a retired teacher, said, “So many people have been affected by the illicit brew. We have decided that the sellers must leave this village and there is no negotiation about it because they have been defiant in selling the brew, knowing very well it has caused death and left youths hopeless, turning them into criminals.”
She continued, “There is one notorious brewer who is arrogant and has gone as far as threatening those who have told him to stop the business.”
Korir’s sentiments were echoed by Betty Cheruiyot, a local, who said, “That particular brewer came to this village and found us peaceful. We welcomed him, but he repaid our goodness with evil, engaging in the sale of illicit brew.”

Kenya Rugby Union Under-18 head coach Paul Odera expressed his admiration for the burgeoning rugby talent in Western Kenya over the weekend.
Odera spoke to Citizen
Digital after overseeing the Under-18 trials held at Kakamega School last Saturday, and is impressed
by the skills and dedication of the young players.
""There is so much talent in this region (Western). When
I came to watch the region last time, it was even better now to see all these
players playing together. Butula, Kakamega School, Chavakali, Koyonzo, Vihiga,
etc., and I think it's a testament to how hard Western Kenya has worked on
getting their players to a very good standard.""
The trials at Kakamega School brought together a total of 66
players from several prominent schools like Vihiga, Chavakali, KSSSA 7s
champions Koyonzo, hosts Kakamega School, and Butula Boys High School.
Odera said the plan was to select 30 players from Western
Kenya, along with selections from other regions, to participate in a regional
tournament. The best players from this tournament will form the national
Under-18 team which Citizen Digital
understands is set to take part in a tournament in South Africa later this
year.
The level 3 holder tactician also hailed the crucial role
educators play in nurturing young talents in the region as a way of promoting
rugby.
""Teachers in Western are doing their best. If you are
not a rugby expert, you can only do what you can do. Here, teachers are doing a
lot for the game, and we need to support the teachers by developing their
coaching skills. I commend them,"" he voiced.
The national under-18 rugby team will be used as a feeder
team to Under 20 'Chipu' and Kenya Simbas.
The Western Kenya Rugby Development Officer (RDO) Shirley
Anindo who was also present during the trials lauded the young talents.
""We've witnessed massive talents today, and it marks a
step in the right direction for the future of rugby in this country, I want to
thank teachers and schools who have allowed their students to take part in this
important exercise” she noted.
A total of 32 out of 71 players have already made the final
cut in the Nairobi region trials.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/business-owners-recount-massive-losses-after-premises-raided-during-anti-finance-bill-protests-n344867,"Business owners recount massive losses after premises raided during anti-Finance Bill protests
The Kenyan business community has decried
this week's Anti-Finance Bill demonstrations which saw multiple businesses
looted by rogue protesters in various
parts of the country.
The business men and women, many of whom ran
small businesses which are yet to take off and had just started posting
profits, have now said that the Tuesday unrest, which saw protesters breach
Parliament grounds and even set City Hall ablaze, left them buried in
incalculable losses after some errant protesters turned rogue, effectively
turning their businesses into chaotic playgrounds of wanton thievery and
destruction.
From Nairobi to Nyeri, Embu to Eldoret, what
started as an otherwise peaceful gathering of crowds quickly turned into a ball
of lawlessness as goons and mischievous rogues poured into the streets with the
sole intention of destroying livelihoods, plunging businessmen to losses and
denying Kenyans their daily bread.
Speaking to Citizen Digital, Chris Njagi, the
General Manager at Baniyas Square, a nightclub in Eldoret, explained the
unimaginable loss he incurred after goons raided his premises, plundering it
and sweeping it clean of any valuable on sight.
There, chaotic anarchists went ahead and
plundered the entire facility - they stole the kitchen machinery, took away all
the sound systems, broke the CCTV cameras, stole the POS system and broke into
the fridges, cleaning them of all the stored beers.
""I personally watched as the madness unfolded...Crowds
of young men running away with stolen beers and soft drinks, people forcing
their way in, people carrying away stolen television sets, people just doing as
they wished for hours,"" he said.
""It got even worse as they stormed into
the kitchen and wiped it clean, looting all the kitchenware, all the groceries,
refrigerated meats, breaking into the freezer and smashing the counter to
pieces.""
Njagi continued to say that the establishment
employs over 100 people and was put up through blood and sweat, adding that the
nightclub lost property estimated at Ksh.40 million.
""Some of us took loans to put up these
businesses. We are still servicing these loans. Baniyas is less than a year
old. I could never imagine such a horror even in my wildest dreams. We are
honest businessmen and did not deserve this cruelty,"" he added.
""We are now staring at losses amounting
to over Ksh.40 million. This is obviously a nightmare to even the most
established business.""
The businessman went on to urge protesters to
exercise restraint and maintain the initial non-violent stance they had adopted
when the protests began.
""I wish we could remain as peaceful as
when we started. I saw crowds telling the police that they come in peace. I
don't know what happened to that. We started off well. Kenyan business people
did not anticipate such incredible losses,"" he lamented.
At Eldoret, yet another club, Timba XO, which
has been associated with Kapseret Member of Parliament Oscar Sudi, was raided
and extensively looted with the photos and videos trending online.
In Nairobi, a business complex along Mfangano
Street, as well as Uganda House, were also set ablaze - the building in
downtown Nairobi burning to ashes with all the stalls, numbering over 700,
going up in flames.
Margaret Githinji, the owner of Executive
Beddings, a shop in downtown Nairobi, explained her losses, even asking clients
to help her get back on her feet again.
""Just to inform you my clients that our
building along Mfangano Street was razed down by goons after looting, Kindly pray
for us,"" she wrote.
Githinji went on to reveal that she lost
goods worth Ksh.5 million. She has now shared her number publicly, asking
well-wishers to help her get back on her feet again.
In Nyeri, Kieni Member of Parliament Njoroge
Wainaina said he incurred losses worth millions of shillings following the destruction
of his businesses.
The lawmaker noted that he suffered losses
amounting to Ksh.550 million during the Tuesday protests after his supermarket
in Kieni was razed down.
These included stock worth Ksh.450 million
and equipment such as bakery shelves estimated to cost around Ksh.100 million.
""The scrap metal dealers are now
scavenging for the metallic stands that remained after the inferno even as the
employees have been left jobless,"" he told The Standard, pointing out that
he had 350 employees.

Published on: July 09, 2024 12:22 (EAT)
This photograph taken on July 3, 2024, shows the arrivals hall at the Terminal 2E of Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport on the day of the presentation of the measures to ease border controls for foreign visitors for the upcoming Paris 2024 Olympic Games, in Roissy-en-France, north of Paris, on July 3, 2024. (Photo by Dimitar DILKOFF / AFP)
Unions representing workers at Paris' airports said Monday they had called for a strike the week before the Paris Olympics over a dispute about bonuses for staff.
The CGT, CFDT, FO and UNSA unions called the strike on July 17 -- nine days before the start of the Paris Games -- to demand that all staff receive an Olympics bonus, denouncing ""unilateral decisions from the chief executive to pay a bonus to only some personnel.""
Unions at state-controlled Groupe ADP, which runs Paris' main airports Charles de Gaulle and Orly, had previously called a strike on May 19, which did not cause major disruption.
The two airports will be the main gateways into France for foreign visitors to the Olympics, with up to 350,000 people expected to transit there daily, as well as most athletes and their equipment.
Competitors are expected to begin arriving in large numbers from July 18, when the athletes' village opens, with a new temporary over-sized baggage terminal at Charles de Gaulle set up to handle equipment such as kayaks and bikes.
Unions representing workers across the public sector in France have demanded extra pay or support for having to work over the July 26-August 11 Games, which fall during the traditional summer holiday in France.
As well as company-wide bonuses, the ADP unions want a ""massive"" recruitment plan for 1,000 extra staff and a guarantee that they can take holidays during the Olympics, which run from July 26-August 11, followed by the Paralympics from August 28-September 8.
""All the trade unions have unilaterally denounced the divisive methods and choices of management,"" a joint statement from them said. ""We have to conclude that the chief executive has dismissed our demands.""
CEO Augustin de Romanet is set to step down after the Olympics.
The threat of strikes disrupting the Paris Games has been regularly discussed in France because of the country's often tension-filled industrial relations and militant trade unions.
Chief organiser Tony Estanguet called for a ""truce"" during the competition.
""I want us to welcome the world in the best possible conditions and that we don't spoil the party,"" he told French television in February.
On the eve of the 1998 football World Cup in France, pilots at national carrier Air France went on strike along with taxi drivers and other transport workers.
Police, air traffic controllers, rubbish collectors, central government employees, metro and train drivers as well as firefighters have all made pay demands ahead of the Olympics, with bosses under pressure to yield to avoid disruption.
Workers at the national mint, which is making the medals, have also been on strike, but management says that production has not been affected.

(Photo by Angelos Tzortzinis / AFP)
France coach Didier Deschamps savoured seeing his side win a penalty shoot-out for the first time since the 1998 World Cup as they beat Portugal in Friday's Euro 2024 quarter-final after another difficult night for star man Kylian Mbappe.
""It's been a long time,"" Deschamps said after France beat Portugal 5-3 on penalties following a 0-0 draw at the end of extra time in Hamburg.
""It was a very hard game. We knew how good a team Portugal were, and both sides could have won.
""It was a bit more difficult for us in extra time, maybe because we were tired and they had a lot more of the ball, but we kept our calm and those who took penalties took them well.""
France lost the 2022 World Cup final on penalties to Argentina and also went out of the last European Championship three years ago in a shoot-out against Switzerland in the last 16.
Also beaten by Italy on penalties in the 2006 World Cup final, this was France's first win in a shoot-out since they defeated the Italians in the quarter-finals of the 1998 World Cup, when Deschamps was a player.
Ousmane Dembele, Youssouf Fofana, Jules Kounde and Bradley Barcola all scored penalties for France before Theo Hernandez converted the decisive kick.
""I am proud of my players, even if we are not doing everything perfectly we don't give up, and once again we are in the semi-finals,"" Deschamps said.
""I will savour this a little even if we have another game coming up.""
France are into a fourth semi-final in the last five major tournaments and will now face Spain in the last four in Munich on Tuesday.
Deschamps' team have made it this far despite scoring only three goals in five matches - one a penalty by Mbappe and the other two from own goals.
Mbappe, again wearing a mask to protect the nose he broke against Austria in France's opening game, struggled against Portugal and was not involved in the penalty shoot-out having been taken off midway through extra time.
""He was beginning to really feel it. Kylian is always very honest with me and the team, and it got to the point where he no longer felt able to accelerate,"" Deschamps said.
""Given everything that has happened to him, that he is not as fit as he would like to be, plus he has had a back problem and the injury to his nose, he is hanging in there.
""He knows he is not on his best form and with all the effort he put in he was very tired.""
France's problems in front of goal have been offset by a defence that has let in just one goal, which was a penalty in the 1-1 draw with Poland in the group stage.
Deschamps nevertheless admitted that his team need to improve in attack.
""You are not telling me we have usurped anyone to get here? Our solidity is exemplary, and that is essential in a major tournament,"" he said.
""When you are not scoring many goals it is better that you don't concede any, but I would prefer us to be more clinical.""

State House Press Secretary Emmanuel Talam made the announcement but failed to disclose the agenda.
This comes amid rising anticipation of a Cabinet reshuffle promised by President Ruto after the anti-government protests forced him to vow to heed the demands of vexed Kenyans.
Ruto has also previously promised to dismiss a select group from his advisory team.
""It is something to think about it is something that will exercise my mind. I have heard you and it is something I will think about going into the future. That's a possibility,"" he said during a round-table discussion with digital journalists.
The address will be his fourth state address in just under three weeks.
On July 5, Ruto announced a raft of austerity measures across various government agencies to align the country’s budgetary expenditure.
He suspended the decision to fill the Chief Administrative Secretary (CAS) positions and said that at least 47 government bodies with almost similar mandates will now be dissolved and their staff absorbed into parent ministries.
Ruto further said that the offices of the First Lady, Second Lady and the spouse of the Prime Cabinet Secretary will be starved any budget allocations.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/showdown-looms-as-defiant-kenyans-set-to-hold-parallel-x-space-at-the-same-time-as-ruto-n345261,"Showdown looms as defiant Kenyans set to hold parallel X Space at the same time as Ruto
A section of Kenyans on X have vowed to
massively boycott President William Ruto's X Space, instead preferring to host
their own parallel Space to counter the Head of State’s own engagement.
Soon after
the Presidency announced that Ruto would be engaging Kenyans on an X space on
July 5, from 2pm to 5pm, thousands of dissents sprang up to discredit the
initiative, with many saying that it was not the President's duty to schedule a
conversation, but rather theirs as his Constitutional employer.
Many others
faulted the move, saying that, over the last three weeks or so, they had made
their demands crystal clear - either in their placards, printed t-shirts,
tweets, street demonstrations and even essays.
Therefore,
they wondered why the President and his team felt the need to cluster around an
X Space even after all that had happened - and had been unequivocally
pronounced - over the course of the past month.
""What
else does he want to hear? Haven't we been repeating the same things over the
last one month? We've been saying it loud and clear. Offline and online. What
else does this man want to hear!? Boycott that useless Space!"" James
Kamau, an X user, said.
As the
boycott calls continued to reverberate across X, some influential figures on
the platform decided to do more than just talk; they vowed to host their own
parallel Space to rival that of the President - to be broadcast at the same
time.
X heavweights
Kimuzi, Osama Otero, Gabriel Oguda and Hanifa Adan all welcomed the idea with
the overwhelming majority settling upon Kimuzi and Osama to host the rival
Space.
Others even
went as far as suggesting that the parallel Space would be hosted in honour of slain
businessman Jacob Juma, a man whose old tweets have continued to provide the
backdrop for the country's current political climate.
Circulating
a poster titled ""Let's Rage On!"", Kenyans on X called upon their
compatriots to share the information widely, explicitly stating that they would
not attend the Ruto Space.
""The
only independent entity you have now as a country is social media. If you allow
Ruto to infiltrate it, you are done. For all those willing to join, it's a free
world. But remember, more than 100 families are grieving their children. Taken
early by this regime,"" Kimuzi tweeted.
Social
commentator Gabriel Oguda also joined in, saying, ""Gen Zs have said they
will also host their parallel X Space session at the same time Ruto will be
speaking to his children tomorrow. This is the violence I signed up for.""
On her part,
user Regina Nzomo said, ""Every Kenyan who respects themselves and loves
this country is hereby asked to boycott the Ruto space. He spoke to Linus
Kaikai, Joe Ageyo and Eric Latiff. The whole nation watched the interview. What
more does this man want to hear?""
Ruto's Space
has brought along with it a rather interesting angle as it appears all
government entities, including parastatals, have been asked - or instructed -
to join the Space convened by their boss.
All Cabinet
Secretaries, too, will all log in as the President seeks to talk to the Gen Z
directly.
Governmental
bodies who have, for the longest time now, shown indifference to government
policy are now even talking about the Space.
The
President's own daughter Charlene Ruto has also thrown herself into the
conversation too, urging Kenyans to heed to the President's unprecedented
invite.
""Young
people, the chance of a lifetime awaits you. I encourage you to use it wisely
and enagage constructively because you are the ones who will determine the
continuity of such levels of discussion for your success,"" she wrote.
""The
first ever president in the world to hold an online meeting with all Gen Z.
Leggoo!""
Miss Ruto's
comments, of course, did not go down with the majority of Kenyans. One asked
her, ""Chance of a lifetime? Is this what you call a chance of a lifetime?
Wow! One more reason for me to NOT attend that scripted Space!""

Ugandan midfielder Pius Chris Akena has penned
a two-year deal with record Kenya Premier League champions Gor Mahia, in the
run up to the CECAFA Kagame Cup and the CAF Champions League.
Prior to signing with Gor, Akena was a free
agent after his one-year contract with Greek second-tier side Apollon Pontou
FC ended last month, after playing seven matches without scoring.
He had previously made a historic move to UAE
second tier club Al Rams Club in January 2023, after leaving Shabab Al Ahli

Before that, Akena played for Uganda Premier
League side Maroons.
He later progressed to playing in Europe,
signing a one-year contract with Greek third tier club Megas Alexandros Agias
Marinas for the 2023–24 season.
The left-footed midfielder was part of the

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/yamal-makes-history-as-spain-sink-france-to-reach-euro-2024-final-n345550,"Yamal makes history as Spain sink France to reach Euro 2024 final
Lamine Yamal, 16, became the tournament's youngest ever goalscorer
as Spain came back to beat France 2-1 in Munich on Tuesday and reach the Euro
2024 final.
Trailing after Randal Kolo Muani headed in a Kylian Mbappe cross
in the ninth minute, Spain turned the match around in a four-minute period,
scoring twice against a side who had only conceded once in five previous games
in this tournament.
Yamal, who turns 17 a day before Sunday's final against either the
Netherlands or England in Berlin, equalised with a superb strike from outside
the box, curling a long-range effort into the top corner and past the
fingertips of an airborne Mike Maignan.
Spain took the lead on 25 minutes, Dani Olmo expertly gathering a
loose ball and firing a low shot into the net with the aid of a deflection off
Jules Kounde.
Masters of midfield game management, Spain shut up shop after
taking the lead, frequently holding possession rather than attack on the
counter, controlling the match and claiming the win.
Three-time champions Spain became the first team to win six games
at a Euros and are one game away from a record-breaking fourth crown.
Finalists in three of the past four major tournaments, questions
will be asked of how France failed to click up front despite boasting enviable
attacking riches.
France had only scored three goals heading into the match, none of
which were scored by a French player from open play and coach Didier Deschamps
reacted, benching forward Antoine Griezmann for Ousmane Dembele.
Yamal created the first chance of the match four minutes in,
lofting a curling cross to an unmarked Fabian Ruiz, who headed over from
point-blank range.
Four minutes later, Mbappe skated down the left flank and sent in
a carbon copy of Yamal's cross, but Kolo Muani's header was on target to give
France the lead.
While the pre-match doubts focused on Spain veterans Jesus Navas,
38, and Nacho, 34, who replaced suspended duo Dani Carvajal and Robin Le
Normand, the younger Aymeric Laporte and Marc Cucurella were at fault for Kolo
Muani's opener.
France's strike seemed to take the wind out of Spain's sails but
it was the youngest player on the pitch who produce a piece of sublime
brilliance to level the scores.
Collecting the ball well outside the box, Yamal cut inside, took
one look at the goal and unleashed a perfect curling strike into the top left
corner.
The goal made Yamal, who already has three assists at Euro 2024,
the youngest scorer in the competition's history, beating the previous record
by a year and a half.
Lamal's goal, 13 minutes after France's opener, ignited Spain's
attack and La Roja took the lead four minutes later through Olmo.
Olmo leapt acrobatically to collect a cleared cross, shed a
defender and smashed goalwards, his shot taking a deflection off Kounde before
bouncing in.
France's
best chance to force extra time fell to their captain with five minutes
remaining, but Mbappe blasted well over with only goalkeeper Unai Simon to
beat.

Published on: July 02, 2024 03:40 (EAT)
Clashes between armed protesters and guards of Turkish positions in Syria's north killed seven people, a medical source and a war monitor said Tuesday in a revised toll.
The protests Monday in the Turkish-controlled border strip followed a rampage a day earlier against Syrian businesses and properties in central Turkey, where a Syrian man had been accused of harassing a child.
""Seven protesters have been killed... during exchanges of fire with people guarding Turkish positions,"" the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
Six were killed in the city of Afrin and one in Jarablus, said the British-based monitor with a network of sources inside Syria.
It did not specify whether the protesters killed were armed or not.
A medical source in northern Syria also told AFP seven people had been killed in the violence.
Calm prevailed on Tuesday morning, AFP correspondents in the area said.
On Monday, hundreds of Syrians demonstrated throughout the Ankara-controlled area, with some armed protesters attacking Turkish trucks and military posts, and taking down Turkish flags.
Some even attempted to storm crossing points, clashing with Turkish border guards.
According to the Syrian Observatory, four border crossings with Turkey have been shut in the wake of the violence.
The protests also extended to the rebel-held Idlib region, near the Turkish-controlled area, an AFP correspondent and the Observatory said.
Earlier Tuesday, Turkish authorities said they detained 474 people after the anti-Syrian riots.
Since 2016, Turkey has carried out successive ground operations to expel Kurdish forces from border areas of northern Syria.
Pro-Turkish forces in Syria now control two vast strips of territory along the border.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan supported early rebel efforts to topple Syrian President Bashar al-Assad at the start of the war in 2011.
But he has reversed course in recent years, with top officials from both countries meeting in Russian-mediated talks.
On Friday, Erdogan had pointed to a possible meeting with Assad, saying it was ""not impossible"".
Turkey, which hosts some 3.2 million Syrian refugees, has been shaken several times by bouts of xenophobic violence in recent years, often triggered by rumours spreading on social media and instant messaging applications.

https://www.citizen.digital/lifestyle/should-you-brush-your-teeth-before-or-after-meal-doctor-gives-best-dental-practices-n345579,"Should you brush your teeth before or after meal? Doctor gives best dental practices
According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), oral health is the state of the mouth, teeth, and orofacial structures that enable individuals to perform essential functions such as eating, breathing, and speaking.
Dr.Naftaly Macharia, a dental implant surgeon, appeared on The Day Break on Citizen TV and gave more insight into oral health care and its importance.
Dr.Naftaly states that brushing twice a day and after meals is important, “There is a controversy going around that you should brush before your meal but it should be after meals in the morning and in the evening for at least 2 minutes.”
“This is enough to remove the plaque causing cavities and other oral health diseases.”
Normally, people brush their teeth before breakfast with the thought that, they are getting rid of the bacteria of the previous night in order to eat breakfast with a fresh mouth.
This myth was debunked by Macharia, who said; “sugar is the most common cause of dental cavities, when you take bread it has sugar. If you brushed before you`ll end up the rest of the day with sugar in your mouth. It’s good to eat first so that you brush after, to wash away the sugar so that it doesn’t cause bacteria.”
Most people have ‘morning breath’ which is the bad breath that people have after sleeping.
Dr Macharai gives further insight into this stating that it is caused by plaque that was formed throughout the night when one was not active.
It is important to brush one`s teeth before sleep to minimize the amount of plaque in the morning.
Macharia elaborated how one should brush their teeth, the types of toothbrushes one can use, and the importance of using the correct toothpaste.
“One should change their toothbrush every 3 months and should ensure they have the proper bristles for their teeth. There are three types of bristles the soft ones, the medium ones and the hard ones,” said Dr. Macharia.
“The soft ones are for the people who have gum disease and should be gentle on their gum, the medium ones are for regular people who don’t have issues while the hard ones are for the people who tend to smoke a lot and stain their teeth, the hard bristles effectively wash away the tar.”
Macharia further elaborated on the most effective way to brush teeth.
“Brush your teeth in gentle round circular motions moving everywhere gently. When one brushes up and down it causes the gum to recede over a period of time and will also cause sensitivity. On top of the teeth is where one can brush up and down.”
“Remember to also brush your tongue it is something that people also forget. Flossing is also important at least once a day before brushing because food packs between the teeth and causes cavities then after flossing and brushing one can use mouthwash,” advises the dentist.
The doctor highlighted the importance of brushing the tongue with either a toothbrush or cleaning with a tongue scrapper in order to prevent bad breath. One may wonder why their breath still smells bad after brushing and this may be caused by not cleaning the tongue effectively.
There are very many types of toothpaste in the market and one may be confused about which one to use. There are two important components of toothpaste, one with fluoride that enhances the quality of the teeth while preventing cavities and abrasives that clean the plaque-causing bacteria.
“You should use fluoriated toothpaste because it comes to form a layer on top of the tooth to prevent bacteria that causes cavities,” says the dentist.
The medical practitioner debunked the myth that salt is effective for replacing toothpaste stating that one should stick to a toothbrush and toothpaste. However, he highlighted that a stick can be just as effective.
Dr. Macharia highlighted the importance of bi-annual dental checkups and stressed the importance of visiting the dentists early before the problem has deteriorated.

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/olympics-a-look-at-some-of-the-most-impressive-kits-as-kenyans-disappointed-in-their-own-n345591,"Olympics: A look at some of the most impressive kits, as Kenyans disappointed in their own
As Kenya continues to deal with the Olympics
kit debacle, other countries around the world have been making public their own
kits, with most of them putting to absolute shame Kenya's rollout.
Last
weekend, Sports Cabinet Secretary Ababu Namwamba unveiled Kenya's Olympics kit
- a rather shabby mish-mash of garments meant to bring out the Kenyan spirit
and pay homage to the Maasai culture.
Soon after
the uniforms were publicised, many Kenyans instantly expressed their
displeasure at the designs which they branded uninspiring and dull.
The kits,
which the athletes casually threw over themselves, saw the CS sustain online
attacks with many Kenyans even going as far as unmasking the men and women
behind the bland designs and putting them to task.
Renowned
apparel designer Brian Babu was even forced to distance himself from the entire
affair, saying that he was not part of the creative team behind the kits and
stating that the production was so shabby, it was basically finalised in a mere
three days.
Whilst all
that is happening, other countries have continued to wow the world with their
exquisite designs - some, like that of the USA team, are even designed by famed
international designers.
From voguish
volleyball outfits to sleek skatewear, this year's event – in the famously chic
French capital, Paris – has been called ""the most fashionable Olympics.""
Legendary
designer Ralph Lauren on Tuesday unveiled the U.S. Olympic team’s outfits for
the opening and closing ceremonies at the 2024 Games, with distinctly different
looks for each.
For the
opening ceremony — which will feature athletes from each country parading down
the Seine in boats — the American contingent will be in jeans and blue blazers
with red and white striping over a striped Oxford shirt. The men’s outfits come
with ties.
For the
closing ceremony, the design borrows from the world of motorsports with a
white-dominant racing-style jacket adorned with patches commemorating Team USA
and each athlete’s sport, along with white pants with ‘Team USA’ written down
the left leg.
Team Canada
will wear one of the country's most famous brands, lululemon, for both the
ceremonies and podium moments.
Looking at
the kit from afar, the standout theme is shades of red, but zooming in a little
closer reveals the intricate print detailing.
There’s both
flora and fauna in the print to showcase the country's vast and varied
landscape.
Fashion and
design commentator Elizabeth Segran, called it, ""The perfect kit.""
Throughout
the Games, Team France will compete in a kit designed by Stéphane Ashpool, best
known as the brains behind streetwear brand Pigalle.
The uniform
is 90s-inspired and celebrates the colours of the French flag.
In classic
Parisian style, the looks were unveiled at Paris Fashion Week, where Ashpool
explained his approach: ""The athletes told me they wanted to be chic,
elegant, bright. The result is these blended colours.""
And over at
the Caribbean, the Jamaican Olympic and Paralympic teams are keeping it
traditional by wearing the colours of the country's flag; streaks of black,
bright yellow, and electric green.
The kits
have been designed by Puma.
At the
launch, Puma CEO Arne Freundt said this year's design marries ""speed and
fashion"", and has been designed to look good while moving: ""The cut
lines have been strategically placed to accentuate the physique of the athletes
whilst providing a showstopping visual that emphasises the beauty of an athlete
in motion.""
And in Great
Britain, Adidas have kept it traditional, using the block colours of the Union
Jack and featuring the flag prominently on all designs.
Adidas
designer Lewer told the BBC: ""It's so important the athletes feel
connected to their team. This is the pinnacle of what they've been training to
be for years, and they really want to be representing their country, and for it
to be visible.""
More
countries have rolled out impressive kits including a Spain, Japan, Portugal
and The Netherlands.
Amsterdam
brand The New Originals, who will clothe Team Netherlands, says the company has
""collaborated closely with the dancers to design uniforms to suit each of
their distinct styles.""
The result
is an 80s-style tracksuit, playing on the colours of the Dutch flag and the
iconic orange of the national football team.
The Kenyan
designers have not explained the inspiration behind their kits neither have
they offered a plausible explanation to the lacklustre look of the entire
rollout, causing massive public uproar.

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/strike-call-threatens-paris-airports-olympics-preparations-n345522,"Strike call threatens Paris airports' Olympics preparations
A dispute between aviation workers and management at the French
capital's airports threatens to overshadow years of preparations and a
50-million-euro investment for visitors and athletes arriving for the Paris
Olympics this month.
Unions at state-controlled ADP group, which runs the main Charles de
Gaulle airport and its cross-town rival Orly, announced a one-day stoppage on
July 17 to press for bigger Olympics bonuses and staff recruitment.
If it continues, the stand-off with management could impact the Games,
with athletes set to start arriving en masse from July 18 and hundreds of
thousands of ticket holders flying in ahead of the July 26 opening ceremony.
""The fact that we are forced to call for a strike is because of the
obstinate refusal of management and in particular the CEO of the company,""
unions said in a joint statement on Monday.
Along with train stations, Charles de Gaulle and Orly are set to be the
main gateways into France for foreign Olympics fans, as well as athletes and
equipment.
The ability of ADP's unions to mobilise workers next week is uncertain,
however, with a previous stoppage called on May 19 having little effect on
operations.
The country's air traffic controllers, despite winning large pay
increases last year, went on strike again on April 25, causing thousands of
flight cancellations.
Charles de Gaulle and Orly will the first glimpse many foreign visitors
and athletes have of the French capital when they arrive for the Games.
As a result, ADP has spent 50 million euros ($54 million) upgrading its
infrastructure and French authorities are deploying extra resources to make the
experience as smooth and safe as possible.
""We know that there are some days that will be really intense and
we will maybe have 300,000 travellers in the same day at Charles de
Gaulle,"" Julien Gentile, director of border security forces at Paris's
airports, told reporters last week.
That number is well above the daily summer average of 200,000 at the
airport and is far beyond the record 250,000 daily fliers reached in the summer
of 2019.
For the duration of the Games, 250 border posts will be open -- 100 more
than normal -- and they will be staffed almost round-the-clock thanks to 2,000
reinforcements, including from the EU's border force Frontex.
""It's like if your supermarket had all of its tills open from the
start of the day to the close,"" Gentile added.
Automated passport control machines, which can be used by EU travellers,
as well as crowd-monitoring technology that alerts managers to the arrival of
passengers, are also part of the efforts to avoid bottlenecks.
One of the key challenges for ADP over the Olympic period is managing
irregular and sharp spikes in demand.
The busiest days are expected to come after the closing ceremony on
August 11 when spectators, officials and most of the 10,000 athletes will head
home.
This coincides with a big changeover period during the French school
summer holidays.
""Athletes and delegations arrive in a fairly dispersed manner and
will leave in very concentrated fashion,"" ADP deputy chief executive
Edward Arkwright told reporters in April this year.
Athletes will also arrive and depart with an estimated 47,000 pieces of
luggage, many of them large and cumbersome, containing items such as kayaks,
bikes or pole-vaulting poles.
A large, specially designed temporary oversized baggage terminal has
been built at Charles de Gaulle, measuring 8,000 m2 (86,000 sq. ft), with a
smaller version constructed at Orly.
As well the strike threats, the unusual baggage, and the spikes in
demand, the city's airports will also have to contend with the arrival of
thousands of VIPs, journalists and officials from the International Olympic
Committee.
The opening ceremony -- to be proceeded by a summit hosted by French
President Emmanuel Macron -- will draw more than 100 heads of state and
government, all of whom require protocol services and parking space for their
jets.
A vast no-fly zone around Paris, with a radius of 150 kilometres (93
miles), will be established during the opening ceremony, grounding all civilian
flights.
Once out of the terminals, regular travellers will find multi-lingual
""welcome teams"" offering advice on travel and buying tickets at the
train stations.
""There's a huge amount of work that's been done,"" the head of
the greater Paris region, Valerie Pecresse, said at the end of June when
unveiling the transport and security.
In the metro and train stations at the airports, police are set to step
up patrols against pickpockets and chain snatchers.
""France's image is in
the balance because this is the first step for a passenger as they arrive in
the country,"" deputy head of border forces at Charles de Gaulle, Regis
Bailleul, explained.

https://www.citizen.digital/wananchi-reporting/mental-health-champions-kilifi-mothers-who-changing-their-childrens-lives-n345100,"Mental health champions: Kilifi mothers changing their children's lives
Published on: July 03, 2024 08:48 (EAT)
Meet 76-year-old Regina Kasiku Mwendo, a mother whose story is known to many in her hometown in Kilifi County.
Mwendo, who hails from Vibao Viwili village, makes hospital trips twice a month to pick medicine for her son and daughter.
She makes the trips on behalf of the two, both adults, who wait patiently for their mother to return home.
With their home located on the border of Kilifi and Tana River Counties, Mwendo says the four-hour journey to Malindi Sub County Hospital has become a common practice.
“I cannot neglect my children. I pick their medicine which they take for at least two months,” she said.
A common figure in the mental health unit, she wakes up early so that she can catch the last bus from Malindi to Tana River, which departs at 3 p.m.
“My first born is in his early 50s. My second born is in her 40s. They have been battling mental health illness for more than 30 years now,” she added.
She says the journey has been fraught with challenges, ranging from the costs of the medicine to stigmatization.
“At first, we would lock them up. But with time, we understood that this is an illness just like any other and hence we resorted to medication,” Mwendo recalled.
Her plight is shared by many including Sidi Kalume, a young woman who was forced to resign from her job as a result of mental illness.
“People around me noticed that I would get easily irritated and I would at times abscond duty,” Kalume said.
Kalume now depends on her mother fully. “I had a good job and I used to be very independent but now I am just at home relying on my mother for everything”, she added.
The cost of her lifelong medication is a significant burden, highlighting the broader issue of expensive mental health treatments in the country.
A 2020 report by the Task force on Mental Health in Kenya recommended mental illness to be declared as a national disaster.
The report further revealed that one in every four Kenyans has a mental health issue.
Beatrice Njeru, head of the mental unit at Malindi Sub County Hospital, corroborates this, noting that the facility receives an average of five to ten new patients daily, resulting to about 30 revisits.
Njeru acknowledges the challenge of expensive medication and lack of enough facilities.
But with satellite clinics cropping up in far flung areas like Marereni in Magarini and Bamba in Ganze; hope lies ahead.
She added that even though the clinics have helped a great deal they are still faced with the shortage of staff.
“Today there will be no clinics in those areas because all three of us are in Malindi to attend to the increasing number of patients,” she added.
The Coastal Region has only one public mental health Unit in Mombasa which is domiciled at Port Reitz Hospital and offers inpatient services.
Dr. Janbiby Yusuf Mohammed, a psychiatrist in Mombasa, acknowledges that there has been an increase in awareness on mental health issues compared to in the past.
“Lack of enough units is a great challenge especially for mental health patients,” Mohammed said.
The medics have called on the government to address the matter in order to avert further crisis.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/biden-says-confident-that-voters-still-support-him-n345452,"Biden says 'confident' that voters still support him
Published on: July 08, 2024 10:24 (EAT)

Joe Biden urged Democratic lawmakers Monday to either back his reelection campaign or challenge him at the party convention next month as the US president's reelection bid entered a critical week.
The 81-year-old doubled down on his defiance of calls to step aside, after a disastrous debate against Republican rival Donald Trump last month turbocharged fears that he is too old to serve a second term.
Biden will be under extra scrutiny this week as he hosts a summit of NATO leaders in Washington, with many allies seeking reassurance amid polls forecasting that the isolationist Trump will win in November.
Biden called in to MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" television program to say that he was ""confident"" the ""average voter out there still wanted Joe Biden.""
Sounding angry in the telephone interview, Biden said he was ""getting so frustrated by the elites... in the party.""
""Any of these guys that don't think I should run -- run against me. announce for president, challenge me at the convention,"" he added.
In a blitz of action to start the week, Biden also penned a lengthy letter to Democratic Party lawmakers that saying ""I decline"" to stand down.
""I am firmly committed to staying in the race,"" Biden wrote.
""The question of how to move forward has been well-aired for over a week now. And it's time for it to end.""
Biden must overcome concerns sparked by the debate, during which repeatedly lost his train of thought, mangled his syntax and spoke with a raspy voice.
He has blamed jetlag and a cold.
But on Sunday four senior congressmen said on a call with party lawmakers that it was time for Biden to bow out, according to US media.
Democrats this week return from a brief recess to Capitol Hill under pressure to either fall in line behind the president or urge him to step aside.
Tuesday, when the NATO summit begins, could prove a turning point: party lawmakers are expected to hold their regular caucus meeting, which could coalesce any bid to force him out.
Biden's performance at the summit marking the 75th anniversary of the NATO alliance will also be closely watched. He is due to attend several meetings and give his first press conference since the debate debacle.
Many European countries are fearful of a return of Trump, as the 78-year-old has long criticized the defense alliance, voiced admiration for Russian strongman Vladimir Putin, and insisted he could bring about a quick end to the war in Ukraine.
After a barnstorming day of campaign events in swing state Pennsylvania on Sunday, Biden has no public events scheduled for Monday, which he is expected to spend preparing for the summit.
First Lady Jill Biden, a fierce defender of the president, is scheduled to campaign for him instead in Georgia, Florida and North Carolina.
On Friday the president picks up the campaign trail once more, heading for the battleground state of Michigan, before going to his beachside home in Rehoboth, Delaware.
With election day just four months away and the party convention in mid-August, the clock is ticking on any move to replace Biden as the nominee.
Biden and his team appear determined to dig in for the siege, with the campaign unveiling an intense schedule for later in July, including an avalanche of TV spots and trips to key states.

Published on: June 27, 2024 07:43 (EAT)

Kenyan demonstrators prepared to resume protests Thursday, a day after President William Ruto made a dramatic U-turn and withdrew contentious tax hikes following deadly rallies earlier in the week.
The demonstrations were sparked last week by the 2024 finance bill and took Ruto's government by surprise as the initially peaceful rallies gathered momentum across the country.
But dramatic scenes Tuesday outside parliament, which saw the partly ablaze complex breached and ransacked, left the nation reeling as a state-backed rights group counted 22 dead nationwide in the aftermath and vowed an investigation.
Addressing a shocked nation on Wednesday afternoon, Ruto said he would not sign the bill, and ""it shall subsequently be withdrawn"".
""The people have spoken,"" he said, adding that he would seek ""engagement with the young people of our nation"".
It was a marked shift from his tough-talking late-night address Tuesday when he likened some of the demonstrators to ""criminals"".
However, prominent protesters dismissed his comments, with one, Hanifa Adan, labelling it a ""PR"" move after the violence at rallies earlier in the week.
Adan said earlier that protesters would ""march peacefully again as we wear white, for all our fallen people"", with some supporters planning to bring flowers in memory of the dead.
""You cannot kill all of us,"" she said on X.
Nelly, 25, told AFP that she intended to join the march on Thursday, criticising Ruto's approach as a case of too little, too late.
""He could have done this earlier without people having to die,"" she said.
""So let it be known that we are marching tomorrow for a better future Kenya.""
The death toll on Wednesday stood at 22, with 19 in the capital alone, according to Roseline Odede, chairwoman of the state-funded Kenya National Commission on Human Rights.
""This is the largest number of deaths (in) a single day protest,"" Odede said, adding that 300 people were injured across the country.
Simon Kigondu, president of the Kenya Medical Association, said he had never before seen ""such a level of violence against unarmed people"".
An official at Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi said Wednesday that medics were treating ""160 people... some of them with bullet wounds"".
Outside parliament -- where the protesters converged on Tuesday -- an AFP journalist saw dried blood on pavements, with the smell of tear gas still lingering in the air on Wednesday morning.
Rights watchdogs have also accused the authorities of abducting protesters.
The police have not responded to AFP requests for comment.
The Kenyan leader had already rolled back some tax measures last week, prompting the treasury to warn of a gaping budget shortfall of 200 billion shillings ($1.6 billion).
Ruto said Wednesday that withdrawing the bill would mean a significant hole in funding for development programmes to help farmers and schoolteachers, among others.
The cash-strapped government had said previously that the increases were necessary to service Kenya's massive debt of some 10 trillion shillings ($78 billion), equal to roughly 70 percent of GDP.
The unrest has alarmed the international community, with Washington on Wednesday calling on Kenya to respect the right to peaceful protest and the UN urging ""accountability"" for the bloodshed.
Ruto's administration is under pressure from the IMF, which has urged the country to implement fiscal reforms in order to access crucial funding.

Sofapaka FC will
be out to close their 2023/24 season on high when they take on National Super
League (NSL) side Naivas FC, in an FKF-PL promotion playoff at the Police Sacco
Stadium on Saturday.
According to
coach Ezekiel Akwana, the 2009 champions had an awful season which saw them
finish 16th in the 18-team Premier League, and have everything to fight for
against Naivas who finished third in the NSL.
Akwana knows it
will be a tough test facing Naivas, who collected 76 points in the NSL to
secure the playoff ticket, finishing just a point ahead of Nairobi United –
with a season-ender 1-0 win over hosts SS Assad in Ukunda last week.
“We had a poor
start this season and it took a lot of effort to escape relegation by the close
of the regular season. We now have one more test, as we strive to keep our
Premier League status. We will give everything to achieve it,” said Akwana.
Veteran Sofapaka midfielder Humphrey Mieno has admitted that it
will be a difficult match, but they are to win and keep their Premier League
spot.
""We know Naivas is a good team and has the motivation to
try to enter the Premier League, but we also want to stay in the top division.
We will face them with the zest and zeal, and we believe we will succeed,""
said Mieno.
Naivas FC coach Collins 'Korea' Omondi has said he is confident
of sealing promotion to the Premier League.
“The only setback is that I will miss my very influential striker
Derick Anami. We will see how to fill
his void, which is a challenge for other to rise to the occasion in this so
important timing of the season,” Omondi said.
The second leg of the playoff has been set for July 14.

Published on: July 02, 2024 10:33 (EAT)
A total of six players from the Kenya Pipeline Women Volleyball Club have been selected by the Kenya Volleyball Federation to form part of the provisional Malkia Strikers team that jetted out yesterday to Manila, Philippines, to take part in the 2024 Challenger Cup.
Captained by Kenya Pipeline’s Trizah Atuka, Malkia Strikers will be the only African team in the Challenger Cup and are poised to contest strongly in the 4-day tournament, which kicks off on July 4.
Captain Trizah Atuka expressed confidence in the team's abilities, stating that they are ready to battle it out in the Challenger Cup and spike their way to the Volleyball Nations League set to take place in Łódź, Poland.
“The KPC team is exceptionally talented, and I am confident that our players will add great value to the Malkia Strikers squad set to represent Kenya and Africa at large in the upcoming games,” she stated.
KPC players who have been called up to the Malkia Strikers team include Trizah Atuka, who plays as a middle blocker, Leonida Kasaya (outside hitter), Emmaculate Nekesa (setter), Loice Simiyu, Pamela Adhiambo (opposite players); and Agripina Kundu (libero).

Sanitary products maker Kotex Kenya has
denounced claims by Nominated Senator Karen Nyamu that her team has been in talks
with the company for a prospective partnership.
The controversial politician on Sunday
announced on social media that Karen Nyamu Foundation had held “a series of meetings”
with Kotex towards a deal that would see schoolgirls in Nairobi’s
underprivileged areas receive free tampons.
“My foundation has had a series of meetings with Kotex Kenya to negotiate on a good deal so that we supply free tampons in schools, particularly in our slums and I'm so excited,” Nyamu wrote alongside a photo of her smiling, posing next to an SUV.
But in a post on its social media pages,
Kotex dismissed Nyamu’s claims as fake.
“Kotex hereby confirms that no discussions
or conversations have taken place with Karen Nyamu. Any assertions regarding a
prospective partnership involving Kotex are entirely false,” the company wrote.
The company said they do not engage in “any political affiliations or endorsements”.

Namuar, who is also a strong United Democratic Party (UDA) party affiliate, said that the move by President William Ruto to decline to sign the Bill into law has paved the way for dialogue.
He further pleaded with his constituents for their pardon after voting for the passing of the Bill which has sparked violent protests and caused the deaths of protesters.
""I laud him for the leadership he has exhibited today to show Kenyans that he can listen to their views. If there is a way we did wrong for those of us who voted YES we ask for your forgiveness,"" he said.
""Also as your (President Ruto) footsoldiers, we ask for forgiveness on your behalf.""
President Ruto on Wednesday bowed to the mounting pressure and announced that he would not pass the unsavoury Bill into law after nationwide protests escalated with protesters even breaching Parliament in the capital.
The breach was a few minutes after the lawmakers voted 195 to 106 in favour of the tax bill which protesters argue will exacerbate the cost of living with the proposed punitive taxes in place.
Meanwhile, protesters have threatened to march to State House, today, Thursday 27, to express their dissatisfaction with President Ruto's government.
Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) have started rolling their armed trucks and tanks into Nairobi in what the government said is to support police officers in maintaining calm. Major roads leading to State House have been heavily barricaded.

Osman Mohamud Mohammed the owner of Qaffe Point restaurant was captured on camera shooting at protestors but those familiar with the incident say he was defending his business.
The now viral video that has been making rounds on social media shows a man, now identified as Osman Mohamud Mohammed shooting at a group of people who were pelting stones at him and his business.
According to those familiar with the incident, the group of people were alleged goons who attacked the premises.
“People were having lunch here, when youthful protestors, who had been infiltrated by goons, came and attacked Qaffe Point, and the windows were smashed as people ate their lunch,” said Qaffe Point associate Abdikadir Dekow.
The owner of the restaurant was inside; his life was at risk and that of his customers as people were pelting stones and throwing crude weapons in their possession.
The owner, Mr Mohammed came out and shot in the air just to disperse the crowd but they kept coming and coming until good Samaritans came and picked him up.
Losses incurred run into millions.
“The loss is quite big, Ksh.18million. His baking machinery is gone; cooking machinery is gone, he approximated to be Ksh.18 million,” noted Dekow.
A Chef, Saidi Makoti added: “Wamehariba kila kitu wameiba… mtungi wa gas, oven….katiba inasema tuandamane peacefully, kwa nini uharibu mali ya mtu.”
Saidi is one of the 75 staff members employed at the restaurant and now his 6-year employment hangs in the balance, same as his co-workers.
“We are 75 staff wote wakienda nyumbani itakuwaje, asipotulipa tutaenda wapi, si tutakuwa wezi,” Saidi added.
“Saa hizi sina kazi niko nyumbani, what should I do? Niende niibe? Sikuzaliwa mwizi nakula jasho langu.”
Religious leaders, while empathizing with the losses are calling on the police to do their job and for the youth to accept the president's olive branch on dialogue.
“Iwapo leo mahakama imewazuia maafisa wa usalama wasijaribu kuzuia yanayotokea kwenye maandamano. Wakenya, nafasi za katiba, shule watoto… polisi wameshindwa, hivi mwataka kufanya kenya Haiti,” Organising Secretary, Mohamed Khalifa said.
The two people injured in the shooting incident continue to receive treatment at Coast General Hospital.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/wait-for-2027-to-elect-who-you-want-mp-mohamed-ali-tells-off-youth-over-anti-govt-demos-n345115,"‘Wait for 2027 to elect who you want’: MP Mohamed Ali tells off youth over anti-gov’t demos
Nyali Member of Parliament Mohamed Ali has
told Kenyan youth to stop the nationwide anti-government protests over what he describes
as a risk of destabilising the country.
The protests, which initially began last
month to pressure legislators to shoot down the unpopular Finance Bill, 2024 have since morphed into resistance against President William Ruto’s entire
administration.
They accuse the Kenya Kwanza administration
of incompetence, neglecting its citizens, corruption and a waste of public
resources.
But the Nyali MP, who belongs to Ruto’s
United Democratic Alliance (UDA) party, says the demonstrations – which entered
their third week on Tuesday – have posed serious economic consequences to the
country and risk running it into instability.
“You have no idea what an unstable country
looks like; ask me, I have been to several countries which have been
destabilised by dirty politics; South Sudan, Somalia, Sudan and Rwanda,” Ali
said on Wednesday during a meeting of UDA legislators and religious leaders in
Mombasa.
“They were all good countries that were
ruined by the youth through dirty politics and tribalism. Let us not waste our
country because of the interests of some people.”
Ali claimed the ongoing protests are backed
by unnamed persons with ulterior motives and urged the youth to stop them.
“This is not about the Finance Bill; it was
not about it. It is about something else and people are taking advantage of
that to destabilise our country,” said the MP.
In his view, Kenyans should give President
Ruto’s administration space to lead and wait for the next General Election in
2027 to elect whoever they want.
“People have the power to elect whoever
they want in 2027. For now, let us allow President William Ruto to put his
house in order. He has rejected the Bill and offered to have a discussion,” Ali
said.
He told the youth to “give the police peace
of mind”.
“I will also go around the county preaching
peace; I don’t care if I will be hit or not,” said the MP, whose office protesters
stormed on June 24 over his absence at the National Assembly when his
counterparts were voting for the contentious draft law.
Ali, himself a former investigative
journalist, further blamed the media for covering the protests, terming it
diminishing to the country.
“Stop participating in activities that will
ruin this country. Learn to discern what to broadcast and what to censor,” he
said.
As of Monday, 39 people had been killed since
the anti-government demonstrations began on June 18, according to the Kenya
National Commission on Human Rights, which noted 361 injuries, 32 cases of
""enforced or involuntary disappearances"" and 627 arrests of
protesters.
In Tuesday’s demos, however, there are claims
that hired goons infiltrated the largely peaceful protests to disrupt, loot and
plunder.
Youth groups were seen charging at police with
stones, breaking into premises and burning others in several parts of the
country.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/rogue-and-inconsiderate-president-lsk-president-lectures-ruto-clergy-over-finance-bill-protests-n344675,"‘Rogue and inconsiderate President!’ LSK President lectures Ruto, Clergy over Finance Bill Protests
The Law Society of Kenya has slammed the government, the
clergy, International bodies and professional bodies over the ongoing anti-Finance
Bill protests.
LSK President Faith Odhiambo in an emotional statement on
Tuesday criticized President William Ruto and the government for sitting pretty
as protesters were being shot and killed.
Dubbed ‘black Tuesday’ Ms Odhiambo wondered how the president
would allow the demonstrations which are now leading to the deaths of youths to go
on, in the name of imposing an unpopular Bill on the people.
She blamed President Ruto over the deaths meted out to youths,
urging him to consider his legacy, so as not to be remembered as the president who
‘killed his people to raise more money by passing the controversial Bill.
‘Every Kenyan today who has lost his or her life in the
struggle to stamp out corruption and seek economic liberation lies in the hands
of a rogue and inconsiderate President,” she stated.
“I congratulate you because history will remember you as the
President who had to kill his people to raise more money. June 25, 2024, will
go down in history as the day Kenyans died so that their president could please
the colonial masters in the name of staggered tax measures recommended for
implementation by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).”
She added: “Like all mothers whose children have been
killed, injured, tortured or abducted in the hands of cops, I feel the pain of
my countrymen. The Gen Z who you call children are out in the streets fighting
for your fellow parents in the National Police Service, Parliament, Cabinet and
air-conditioned government offices. Just imagine, your child is out there
seeking justice when you are comfortably enjoying life. Have we no shame?”
The LSK boss went on to chide the head of state for
allegedly deploying the military outside Parliament in the name of containing
protesters, saying the Society would pursue justice for the victims even
through international investigative bodies.
According to Odhiambo, it was against the law to assign
soldiers to deal with internal conflicts since their role was to protect the
country from external conflicts.
“We seek Justice; LSK calls upon the international criminal
investigation authorities to help poor Kenyan families’ quest for Justice. We
have reports and videos that show Kenya Army soldiers engaging protesters in
Parliament. We want answers under what law the president used to deploy
Kenya's Defence forces on Kenyan soil. No penny is worth human life! No amount of
taxation, threats and intimidation will stop this journey for Justice,” LSK
noted.
LSK also took issue with the silence witnessed across the
clergy; both Muslims and Christians wondered why the religious bodies were mum
on the issue of protests and had not come out to call out the government or
even join in the demonstrations.
President Odhiambo called into action the different religious
groups in the country underscoring that they should have already voiced out
their support to the protests or the criticism of the government.
“To the Clergy, council of imams and preachers, where are
you today as the country goes down the slopes of dictatorship without respect
for the rule of law? Where is my beloved Catholic Church or what became of the
Kenyan Conference of Catholic Bishops? Where is the Anglican Church of Kenya
and the National Council of Churches when young Kenyans are being dropped dead
by bullets from Police Officers? Does the Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims
still exist?” Ms Odhiambo posed.
“When the time comes to perform burial rites to the dead
protesters, what will you tell their family members? Where was the shepherd
when the enemy raided and scattered the flock? What stops you men of the cloth
from joining peaceful Kenyans in the streets or are you comfortably hiding
behind the pulpit waiting for us to come on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday carrying
gifts, offertory and tithes? Is that all that you care about? Even if it’s not
for the Finance Bill then please come out and let’s protect our children, our
brothers, our sisters, or better still your grandchildren.”
The LSK likewise reprimanded the United States and United Kingdom
Ambassadors to Kenya Meg Whitman and Neil Wigan OBE, respectively, for their
silence on the protests.
She also faulted the two nations for overseeing the recent
deployment of 1000 police officers to Haiti, opining that the move was only
meant to benefit a few in government.
“Your Excellency Meg Whitman, wasn’t it historic enough that
on Monday, June 24, 2024, as Haiti-bound Kenyan Police Officers took to the
skies, your boss President Joseph R Biden invoked section 517 of America’s
Foreign Assistance Act designating Kenya as a major nonNATO ally of the United
States of America?” Asked the LSK boss.
“Congratulations madam Ambassador! Kenyans today enjoyed the
first fruits of being a non-NATO ally. And to you, Neil Wigan OBE - his
Majesty's High Commissioner to the Republic of Kenya, is the King happy with
the deaths of Rex Kanyike Masai, Evans Kiratu and several other protesters shot
dead today outside Parliament?”
The Society has urged the Media Council of Kenya, Editors
Guild, Public Relations Society, COTU, KNUT and all other professional bodies
to come out in unison and speak on the matter.

https://www.citizen.digital/entertainment/popular-content-creator-muchiri-mike-arrested-while-on-instagram-live-n345669,"Popular content creator Muchiri Mike arrested while on Instagram LIVE
The comedian and singer, who has been massively active throughout the anti-government demos, and who has not hidden his disdain for tthe current political dispensation, was interacting with fans and followers around Kasarani when his LIVE session abruptly stopped.
Muchiri then took to X to notify followers that he had been arrested at Kasarani.
He wrote, ""They are arresting me at Kasarani.""
He, however, did not specify what the arrest was about, where he had been booked and who the people behind the arrest were - lately, people expressing their opposition to the government have faced arrests even from plain-cloth individuals, claiming to be the police.
But in a short video shared by someone who was virtually following the drama, Muchiri can be seen seated in his car while a song plays.
Outside, a uniformed male police officer can be seen.
At that point, Muchiri then quickly turns to the camera, saying, ""Wamenisimamisha hapa Kasarani Police Station... And they are trying to..""
The video abruptly cuts and then buffers for some seconds before going off.
Fellow content creator Esther Kazungu also confirmed the arrest, but asked fans to wait for the full version of the story before jumping into. conclusions.
""Mike's been arrested and it's unclear whether it's a traffic offence or the government doing government things,"" she wrote.
""Don't want to jump into conclusions yet but we're following up...""
Activist Boniface Mwangi, too, has reacted to the arrest, asking Muchiri to share his phone number in order to find help.
The entertainer-turned-activist has seen his profile grow exponentially over the last month after he took bold steps in pushing for the rejection of the Finance Bill, later becoming one of the most virulent anti-government celebrity voices online.
As the demos started taking shape in early June, Muchiri was one of the first prominent personalities who helped fuel the movement - he helped translate the Finance Bill in a dozen Kenyan languages, making it easy to digest to all Kenyans from all walks of life.
On Sunday, he was front and centre at the Shujaaz memorial concert held at the Uhuru Park in honor of the fallen protesters who died at the hands of rogue police

Defending champions Kenya Ports
Authority (KPA) women’s head coach Anthony Ojukwu is optimistic of getting
double wins in Game One and Two of the Kenya National Basketball Women’s
Premier League Final against rivals Equity Hawks.
The Dockers who have been in Nairobi
since Monday preparing for the weekend matches are ready for the test in their
quest to defend the title, according to Ojukwu.

“Playoffs are always different ball
games, I believe my players will come out very strong, play like
champions, bring their A class game…,” Ojukwu said.
Ojukwu is however aware of the threat
posed by the Bankers, despite defeating them home and away during the regular
season.
“Equity is a very good team, an all-round
team so we are going to approach them with all the respect. Being the
playoffs we will like to put more pressure on them by winning the first two
games on Saturday and Sunday, so that we can finish the work in Game Three in Mombasa
the following weekend,” a confident Ojukwu averred.
“I’m glad there are no injuries in my
camp, the morale is very high, players are really excited to be in the final

https://www.citizen.digital/news/pelosi-clooney-democratic-senators-raise-new-doubts-about-biden-n345639,"Pelosi, Clooney, Democratic senators raise new doubts about Biden
Biden must decide quickly whether to stay in the 2024 White House race, former House Speaker Pelosi, a longtime Biden ally, said on MSNBC while declining to say definitively that she wanted him to run.
Hollywood star Clooney, a Democrat who co-hosted a star-studded fundraiser for Biden last month, withdrew his support with a damning opinion piece in the New York Times saying Biden was not the same man he was in 2020.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, meanwhile, has privately signaled he's open to a Democratic candidate other than Biden, according to Axios. Schumer, though, reiterated his support for Biden in a statement following the Axios report.
Senator Peter Welch called on Biden to withdraw in an op-ed published late on Wednesday, the first Democratic senator to explicitly call for the president to step aside.
One major donor said Democratic leaders had indicated they would issue statements of concern after the NATO summit, but did not mention Schumer by name.
""It's going to be a bloodbath,"" the source said, citing growing anger among lawmakers and donors, as well as growing pressure on down-ballot candidates.
The Abandon Biden Campaign, which has opposed Biden's candidacy over his handling of the Israel-Gaza war, on Wednesday urged all Americans to call for Biden to step aside, although saying it also has no delusions about Trump and his ""culture of hate.""
Pelosi's remarks, which ignored Biden's repeated insistence that he is staying in the race, appeared to be the harbinger of a fresh wave of calls from fellow Democrats to exit the race.
For nearly two weeks, the 81-year-old Biden has sought to stem defections by Democratic lawmakers, donors and other allies worried he might lose the Nov. 5 vote to Republican Donald Trump, 78, after his halting June 27 debate performance.
The president has said he had a bad night at the debate, insisting he will stay in the race and defeat Trump.
Pelosi said on MSNBC she was encouraging colleagues on Capitol Hill with concerns about Biden to refrain from airing them while he hosts NATO leaders in Washington this week.
""I've said to everyone: let's just hold off. Whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately, but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week,"" she said, describing Biden's strong remarks at the NATO summit on Tuesday as ""spectacular.""
She declined to say definitively that she wanted Biden to run. ""I want him to do whatever he decides to do,"" she said. ""We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short.""
Biden's campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon and senior advisers Mike Donilon and Steve Ricchetti will brief Senate Democrats at a lunch on Thursday, Biden's campaign said.
Asked to comment on Pelosi's remarks and Clooney's article, Biden's campaign pointed to a letter he sent Democrats in Congress saying he was ""firmly committed"" to staying in the race and beating Trump.
Asked at the NATO summit whether he still had Pelosi's support, Biden responded by raising a triumphant fist.
Other Democrats echoed Pelosi on Wednesday, however, suggesting Biden's efforts to quell dissent within his party had not succeeded. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said he was ""deeply concerned"" about Biden's ability to win the race.
In Dallas, Vice President Kamala Harris, the party frontrunner to replace Biden if he were to step aside as the Democratic candidate, spoke to a group of some 19,000 people at an event of the historically Black Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority.
The election is the most ""existential"" and consequential of their lifetimes, Harris said to a crowd that chanted, ""Four More Years!""
CLOONEY WITHDRAWS SUPPORT
In his opinion piece, Clooney wrote: ""It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,"" Clooney wrote.
""We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate.""
Democrats in Congress remain deeply divided over whether to fall in line behind Biden or to urge him to step aside because of persistent questions about his health and acuity.U.S. Representative Earl Blumenauer on Wednesday became the ninth Democratic member of the House of Representatives to call for the president to end his re-election campaign.
Public defections remain a small segment of the 213 Democratic-aligned House members, and the party's leadership has continued to back Biden publicly. No Senate Democrat had broken ranks until Welch's op-ed on Wednesday, although Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado said on Tuesday he did not believe Biden could beat Trump.
Biden, eager to change the story, has surrounded himself with communities of his staunchest supporters, including Black Democratic lawmakers and voters. His campaign has framed sticking with Biden as a return of the loyalty he has shown them through his half-century of public life.
Biden was greeted with raucous applause when he met on Wednesday with a group of labor leaders, an important part of his political base, joining an AFL-CIO executive council meeting in Washington to discuss ""their shared commitment to defeating Donald Trump,"" the Biden campaign said.
Biden listed high rents, expensive groceries and a lack of housing as issues to be tackled going forward.
Labor votes helped Biden defeat Trump in competitive states, including Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania, in 2020.

KCB secured a spot in the final after winning 4-2 on post-match shootouts against Kariobangi Sharks, following a 1-1 draw in regulation time while Police FC earned their place by defeating AFC Leopards 1-0.
Police FC head coach Salim Babu believes it will be too costly to lose the final as he bids to guide the law enforcers to their first ever continental football.
“From the start we’ve set continental football as our main target. But first we must get over the KCB hurdle and then we can think about continental football. This is a perfect chance to show how Police FC have progressed in recent years,” said Babu.
Babu’s opposite number Bernard Mwalala is also keen to lift the title as they bid to salvage a below par season which saw the Bankers finish tenth place.
Mwalala, who won the Cup with Bandari in 2019, believes he can emulate his past heroics and lift the gong this year.
“First things first.We’ve not done well in the league this season and we are working hard to reward our sponsors with this Cup and after that we will think about Confederation competition. Our focus is how to utilize these 90 minutes and get the title,” said Mwalala.
“KCB has made significant strides in the recent seasons. Qualifying for this Cup’s final is massive for the club eyeing its first-ever trophy. I call upon the team to remain focused and to be wary of the Police’s threat ahead of the weekend fixture. Our aim is to win the match to get an opportunity to participate in continental football next season,” said KCB goalkeeper coach Samuel Okoth “Koko”.
KCB will miss their assistant captain Brian “Rio” Ochieng and forward Derrick Otanga, who is suspended after picking yellow cards in the quarterfinal and semi-final clashes.
“Otanga and Rio really stepped out during the past matches, but now it is another duty for other players to step in, and I believe we have worked well with all the players; we understand what we need, and they know how important this match is and I know they are going to step up,” added Koko.
Goalkeeper Farook Shikhalo is expected to start for KCB, replacing Gabrial Andika, who has featured prominently in the last matches of the season for the Bankers.
Center back Haniff Wesonga, who pulled out of the national U23 team that is in South Africa for the COSAFA tournament, is also expected to lead the defence against the law enforcers
Besides the cash prize of Sh. 2 million, the winning team will get the opportunity to represent the country in the CAF Confederation Cup next season.
AFC Leopards will face Kariobangi Sharks in the third-place playoff on Saturday at 11 am, followed by the grand finale between Police and KCB at 2 pm.

Flooding in neighbouring India, as well as in downstream Bangladesh, has also caused widespread damage and impacted millions.
""Police are working with other agencies and locals to find the missing people,"" Nepalese police spokesman Dan Bahadur Karki told AFP.
Those killed and missing are in multiple locations.
Monsoon rains from June to September bring widespread death and destruction every year across South Asia, but the numbers of fatal floods and landslides have increased in recent years.
Experts say climate change and increased road construction are exacerbating the problem.
Parts of Nepal have been receiving heavy rainfall since Thursday, prompting disaster authorities in the Himalayan nation to warn of flash floods in multiple rivers.
There have been reports of inundation in several districts of lowland areas bordering India.
Last month 14 people were killed in Nepal in ferocious storms that brought landslides, lightning and flooding.
In India, floods have swamped the northeastern state of Assam, with six people killed in the last 24 hours, Assam's Disaster Management Authority said Sunday.
That takes the death toll from the downpours since mid-May to 58.
In low-lying Bangladesh, downstream from India, the disaster management agency said floods had impacted more than two million people.
Much of the country is made up of deltas where the Himalayan rivers the Ganges and the Brahmaputra wind towards the sea after coursing through India.
The summer monsoon brings South Asia 70-80 percent of its annual rainfall.

Italy are once again staring into the footballing abyss after Saturday's humbling exit from Euro 2024 at the hands of Switzerland, the defence of their continental title ending in embarrassing fashion.
A shockingly one-sided tie in Berlin, where Italy won the 2006 World Cup, led to a dismal last-16 exit after Luciano Spalletti's side had scraped through the group stage by the skin of their teeth.
Saturday's limp defeat was one of the lowest points in the history of the four-time world champions and reigning kings of Europe, and the latest in a worryingly large number of recent humiliations, including missing out on the last two World Cups.
Italy were pinned back by the Swiss in the first half and after Ruben Vargas' brilliant strike seconds after half-time they were easily held at arm's length as they limped out of the tournament.
On Italy's national broadcaster RAI the verdict was swift and brutal: ""unacceptable"", ""slow and predictable"", said disconsolate commentators.
After the match, Spalletti lamented to RAI how Vargas' goal ""took our legs out from under us"" and said that his players didn't come into the tournament in the right physical condition to compete.
He also suggested that Italy were affected by the heat in Berlin's Olympiastadion, even though it didn't stop the Swiss from performing at their best.
""Unfortunately, sharpness and tempo makes the difference,"" said Spalletti.
""Right now, for too many reasons, we are unable to do anything more than this.""
It was not a convincing explanation for such disjointed performances over four matches and those comments followed a series of bizarre outbursts from Spalletti, who took the Italy job last summer with a huge amount of credit accrued after leading Napoli to a historic Serie A title.
Italian media are already questioning Spalletti's position after less than a year in charge, so bad was his team's showing in Germany and so confusing his constant chopping and changing of line-ups and formations.
World Cup 2026 qualifiers begin in September and after Saturday's post-match press conference journalists were informed that Spalletti would have discussions with Italy's football federation on Sunday to ""take stock"" before another conference with reporters.
But Spalletti refused to directly address his future, only saying vaguely that ""we need to change things"" and taking it in turns to take responsibility and then blame outside factors.
""I take responsibility for what happened, the players are mine, I chose them. I'm not happy with how we played today nor am I happy with how we played against Spain,"" said Spalletti.
He added: ""All of the other coaches had 20 games in charge, some had 30, before the Euros, I only had 10... We also had a number of players who sustained injuries, players I was counting on.""
Spalletti's new-look side had come into the tournament as a work in progress and there were promising signs from their opening 2-1 win over Albania.
However, things rapidly went downhill with a single-goal thumping at the hands of Spain, in which goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma kept the score respectable, and it took a 98th-minute equaliser against Croatia to send Italy through.
Captain Donnarumma was Italy's only real bright spot at what was otherwise a miserable tournament and he was visibly upset at the nature of Italy's elimination.
""It hurts, it really hurts. We can only say sorry to everyone, we were disappointing today and they deserved to win,"" said Donnarumma.
""It's difficult to digest but that's how it went, we can't do anything about it.""
His apologies fell on deaf ears however as angry fans in the stands unloaded their frustration on a team which enters yet another period of transition and soul-searching.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/womens-world-banking-hosts-financial-inclusion-talks-in-nairobi-n345109,"Women’s World Banking hosts financial inclusion talks in Nairobi
The event convened by Women’s World Banking brought together senior leaders from financial services, policymaking and other key stakeholders across Africa to spotlight the crucial work to empower nearly one billion women excluded from the formal financial sector.
They urged Africa to create a more robust financial inclusion for women-led enterprises in a bid to boost economic growth.
Women’s World Banking CEO & President, Mary Ellen Iskenderian, led a compelling conversation with Debra Mallowah, a former member of their Africa Advisory Council. They delved into the challenges and opportunities surrounding financial inclusion for women and women’s leadership, sharing insights and success stories from the field.
“I believe that expanding microfinance institutions and programs that specifically target women can provide the initial capital necessary for women to start and grow their businesses. African states can also establish credit guarantee schemes that reduce the risk for banks and other financial institutions when lending to women-led businesses.” Said Iskenderian,
Africa faces a significant financing gap of $42 billion for these businesses despite having one of the world's highest rates of female entrepreneurship. A 2023 report from the African Development Bank (AfDB) reveals a US$42 billion financing deficit for African women-led enterprises compared to their male counterparts. The continental lender points this partly to the misperception that women are riskier borrowers due to a lack of collateral and financial experience, leading to their loan applications being rejected.
Despite strides in financial inclusion, approximately 500 million women in Africa, including over 300 million in Sub-Saharan Africa, remain excluded from formal financial systems. This exclusion is compounded by infrastructural challenges, perceived risks in lending to women in the informal sector and entrenched social and cultural norms that limit women's access to and usage of financial services.
Further, Iskenderian stated that there is a need to address the gender gap in access to finance that can profoundly impact economic growth, poverty alleviation, and social development.
“Women make up 58 per cent of Africa's self-employed population and contribute around 13 per cent of the continent's Gross Domestic Product but until gender parity is improved throughout the African continent, female entrepreneurs will remain under-earning compared with their male counterparts. Governments and policymakers can support women entrepreneurs and female-led startups in Africa through targeted policies including gender-responsive budgeting and utilizing the African Continental Free Trade Agreement.” Added Iskenderian
The reception provided an insightful look into Women’s World Banking's ongoing efforts and achievements in promoting financial inclusion for women, especially in the Kenya region. Attendees had the opportunity to learn about significant advancements globally and in the area, all working toward a more inclusive financial future in Africa.
Angela Wambugu, Women’s World Banking, Director, Advisory Services –Africa, argued that African states can start by enacting policies promoting gender equality in the financial sector. “Ensuring women have equal rights to property and inheritance can empower them economically, making it easier for them to access credit as they can offer collateral. We should also introduce innovative financial products that can help cater to women entrepreneurs' unique context and needs,” said Wambugu.
Since 2018, Women’s World Banking has enabled 1.6 million African women to access financial solutions, working with over 20 financial services providers across the region. The organization also engages with a diverse set of policymakers through programs like the Leadership & Diversity Program for Regulators, including collaborations in Rwanda, Nigeria, Egypt, Kenya and Ghana.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/kennedy-onyango-a-boy-killed-by-bullet-and-ex-lovers-scramble-for-gravesite-n345378,"Kennedy Onyango: A boy killed by bullet and ex lovers’ scramble for gravesite
As the dust was yet to settle on whether Kennedy died after a gunshot from rogue police, or from a rogue protester as stated by President William Ruto, tragedy befell his family on Saturday as mourners led by her mother Jacinta Anyango were heading to Rusinga Island to lay him to rest.
The mourners were intercepted in Mbita town by a group led by Kennedy’s father Denis Okinyi, who were armed with a court order stopping the burial of Kennedy in Kamasengre village.
Okinyi, who is an ex lover of Jacinta, moved to Mbita law Court to stop the mother from burying Kennedy in her second marital home.
Now, Jacinta is left with is the burial burner, 200 burial programs and sample of wreath flowers that were meant to colour the burial day that never was.
Behind her tears, Jecinta is asking for government intervention to let her burry her child, stating that Okinyi was an absentee father, whose name does not appear in Kennedy’s birth certificate.
She claims that Okinyi only appeared after realising that the government was taking care of the burial expenses and that all he wanted was to take charge of the contributions.
85 Kms from Rusinga island, at the foot of Gwasi hills, Okinyi's larger family is gathered to plan for the burial of Kennedy.
Okinyi claims that his former wife had only lived with the child for one year as Kennedy was under his custody in earlier years.
He claims that he was blocked from viewing the child’s body in Nairobi, only to realise that burial was to take place in Rusinga. Hence his decision to move to court to stop the burial.
Kennedy’s body now lies in Suba Sub-County Hospital, awaiting a court ruling on July 17, 2024.
On Saturday, news of halting Kennedy’s burial attracted uproar from the public, with police being accused of frustrating the family.
This prompted a statement from Inspector General Japhet Koome, who clarified that police were only complying with the court order.
“Apparently, the Civil Suit No. 0028 of 2024 filed at Mbita Law Courts ordered the police to move the body to Suba Sub-County Hospital Funeral Home for preservation, and the OCS Mbita Police Station complied with the order,” Koome noted.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/kenya-force-leaves-nairobi-to-tackle-gang-violence-in-haiti-n344617,"Kenya force leaves Nairobi to tackle gang violence in Haiti
Published on: June 25, 2024 08:37 (EAT)
Kenyan security officers on board a Kenya Airways flight as they depart for Haiti.
A Kenyan force to lead a UN-backed multinational mission to tackle gang violence in Haiti departed Nairobi late Monday, Interior Minister Kithure Kindiki said, despite a court case against the deployment.
Kenya offered to send 1,000 police to stabilise Haiti, alongside forces from several other countries, but the deployment has run into persistent legal troubles.
Some 400 officers left Nairobi at 10:50 pm (1950 GMT) aboard the national carrier, Kenya Airways, en route to Haitian capital Port-au-Prince.
""Honoured to see off the first batch of the contingent of the National Police Service officers who are part of the historic United Nations Mission to Haiti,"" Kindiki said in a statement, accompanied by images of the officers at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport.
The group comprises elite officers from the Rapid Deployment Unit, General Service Unit, Administration Police, and Kenya Police.
The deployment came hours after President William Ruto -- an enthusiastic backer of the mission -- bid a ceremonial goodbye to the officers on Monday.
Media was not invited to the ceremony in Nairobi where Ruto prayed for the officers and handed them a Kenyan national flag, according to the footage shared by the presidency.
""This mission is one of the most urgent, important and historic in the history of global solidarity,"" Ruto told the officers in quotes shared by his office.
""Your presence in Haiti will bring hope and relief to communities torn apart by violence and ravaged by disorder,"" he said, adding that the rest of the force will join their colleagues ""soon"".
- 'Circumventing' the law -
The deployment was approved by a UN Security Council resolution in October, only to be delayed by a Kenyan court decision in January.
The court said Ruto's administration had no authority to send officers abroad without a prior bilateral agreement.
While the government secured that agreement with Haiti in March, a small opposition party, Thirdway Alliance Kenya, filed a fresh lawsuit in another attempt to block it.
The party's leader, Ekuru Aukot, told AFP on Monday that he intended to ""seek an injunctive order against the deployment"".
""There is an active ongoing court case. So William Ruto is circumventing that because he does not believe in the rule of law,"" he said, describing the Kenyan leader as ""a slave of America"".
The United States had been eagerly seeking a country to lead the mission and is supplying funding and logistical support.
But President Joe Biden flatly ruled out US boots on the ground in Haiti -- the poorest nation in the Americas, where Washington has a history of intervention.
With the arrival of the Kenyan force, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said: ""We hope to see further measurable improvements in security, particularly with respect to access to humanitarian aid and core economic activity.""
""We stand with the international community in supporting this historic effort to support the Haitian National Police in their fight for Haiti's future,"" he told reporters in Washington.
But Human Rights Watch has raised concerns about the Haiti mission and doubts over its funding, while watchdogs have repeatedly accused Kenyan police of using excessive force and carrying out unlawful killings.
A senior police official defended the force's record, saying they were an elite team that had gone through extra training.
""They have all undertaken a rigorous training for this exercise on top of their prior training of handling complex situations and are ready for the mission,"" he told AFP.
""Please let's not doubt their capacity.""
Other countries that have expressed willingness to join the mission include Benin, the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, and Chad.
Haiti has long been rocked by gang violence but conditions sharply worsened at the end of February when armed groups launched coordinated attacks in Port-au-Prince, saying they wanted to overthrow then prime minister Ariel Henry.
Henry announced in early March that he would step down and hand over executive power to a transitional council, which named Garry Conille as the country's interim prime minister on May 29.
The violence in Port-au-Prince has affected food security and humanitarian aid access, with much of the city in the hands of gangs accused of abuses including murder, rape, looting and kidnappings.

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/murray-out-of-wimbledon-singles-as-djokovic-makes-bow-n345048,"Murray out of Wimbledon singles as Djokovic makes bow
Andy Murray lost his race to be fit for the Wimbledon singles on Tuesday
as Novak Djokovic prepared to launch his bid for a record-equalling eighth
Wimbledon men's crown.
The withdrawal of two-time champion Murray means Djokovic is the only
member of the fabled ""Big Four"" in the men's draw at the All England
Club.
Roger Federer has retired and Rafael Nadal opted to skip Wimbledon to
prepare for a shot at another Olympic title.
Murray, 37, is hoping to end his stellar career at the upcoming Paris
Games but desperately wanted to make a final singles appearance at Wimbledon,
where he was champion in 2013 and 2016.
The Scot, who has been ravaged by injuries in recent years, will still
play doubles with his brother Jamie in what is bound to be an emotional
farewell in front of his adoring British fans.
Murray underwent surgery to remove a cyst from his back last month after
being forced to pull out of Queen's, a procedure he described as ""not
insignificant"".
""Unfortunately, despite working incredibly hard on his recovery since
his operation just over a week ago, Andy has taken the very difficult decision
not to play the singles this year,"" said a statement from Murray's
representatives.
""As you can imagine, he is extremely disappointed but has confirmed
that he will be playing in the doubles with Jamie and looks forward to
competing at Wimbledon for the last time.""
Murray was replaced in the draw by Belgium's David Goffin, a lucky loser
from qualifying.
Djokovic, born a week apart from Murray in May 1987, had a knee
operation after pulling out before his French Open quarter-final -- sparking
fears he would not be fit in time for Wimbledon.
But the Serbian world number two, who was beaten by Carlos Alcaraz in
last year's final, has said he is ""pain-free"" and opens against Czech
qualifier Vit Kopriva.
He knows time is not on his side as he bids to equal Federer's Wimbledon
title record and become the first player -- man or woman -- to win 25 Grand
Slam singles titles.
""I do have something that is described as a feeling of not missing
out at a Grand Slam while I can still play and while I'm still active and at
this level,"" said the Djokovic, who has reached the past five finals at
the All England Club.
""I wouldn't call it a fear of missing out. I would just say it's
this incredible desire to play, just to compete.
""Particularly because it is Wimbledon, the tournament that always
has been a dream tournament for me when I was a kid. Just the thought of me
missing Wimbledon was just not correct. I didn't want to deal with that.""
Also in action on the second day of the Championships is women's world
number one and five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek, eager to progress
beyond the quarter-finals for the first time.
Swiatek, 23, arrives at the All England Club on the back of a 19-match
winning streak but with lingering questions over whether she can transfer her
clay-court form to the grass.
First up for the Polish player is Sofia Kenin, whom Swiatek defeated in
the first round of the Australian Open this year.
Marketa Vondrousova launches her title defence against Spain's Jessica
Bouzas Maneiro while 2022 champion Elena Rybakina is also in first-round
action.
Ons Jabeur, the beaten
finalist in 2022 and 2023, takes on Japan's Moyuka Uchijima.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/gathoni-wa-muchomba-recounts-the-killing-in-parliament-during-occupyparliament-protest-n345297,"Gathoni wa Muchomba recounts the killing in parliament during #OccupyParliament protest
As peaceful and unarmed protestors stormed the Kenyan parliament building to protest the 2024 Finance Bill, shocked Members of Parliament quickly sought safety in secure locations.
Githunguri Member of Parliament Gathoni Wa Muchomba witnessed what has been termed an extra-judicial killing outside the parliament building. As the day wore on, she and a few Kenya Kwanza members who voted NO, along with some Azimo members of Parliament, walked out of parliament singing.
""In the process of walking, shooting ensued. We could hear machine guns. We walked towards the gate of parliament but were forced back to the veranda. From there, I could see men in golden hoods; we couldn't tell if they were police. They knelt down and started shooting at the parliament grills and towards the Senate,"" she recalled the chilling events that led to the loss of young unarmed Gen Zs.
What remained was an immeasurable loss that continues to reverberate today. According to the lawmaker, the protestors would retrieve the bodies of those hit by bullets and retreat while others charged forward, despite the MPs' unsuccessful attempts to dissuade the armed police.
She and other lawmakers watched everything unfold with a devastating realization that promising and brave young people had been viciously murdered.
""These young people were so brave. Despite the vicious attack, they collected the bodies of those hit by bullets and placed them right in front of the parliament gate,"" she told Citizen Digital.
As many Kenyans continue to struggle to come to terms with the harrowing events of the past three weeks, Wamuchomba remains disturbed, noting it is one of the worst tragedies in Kenyan history, yet it could have been avoided.
""I saw those children lifting their hands, screaming 'we are peaceful!' They shouted 'we are many!' and the machine guns would roar. They would fall down and stand up again while shouting 'we are peaceful.' Some were shot while kneeling. It was a painful image to watch; I could not sleep for two days,"" she said.
The outspoken parliamentarian, described as a thorn in the flesh of Kenya Kwanza for her opposition to the president's views, was vindicated when the president conceded and withdrew the bill after immense pressure from Kenyans.
She added that the country cannot heal and move forward if its leaders do not empathize with what Kenyans are going through. She described those who lost their lives during the peaceful demonstration as heroes of economic freedom, not criminals as portrayed.
""Those who lost their lives should be given a state funeral. The government of Kenya should cover the hospital bills and provide compensation to the families. What is more important: the finance bill or the lives of Kenyans?"" she said.
She notes that for the nation to move forward, the political class, including the president, must apologize to Kenyans.
""I apologize on behalf of the political class in Kenya for not listening to the opinions of young people and for pushing them to the extent where they had to lose their lives for the bill to be withdrawn. It is very unfortunate that the president had to wait until it became what it is for him to withdraw the bill,"" she added.
She advises her counterparts to remember that they are not the bosses of their voters but their representatives.
""Many parliamentarians are not visiting their villages because they cannot face them. They sent us to represent them; Kenyans did not send us to parliament to kill or oppress them. They did not send us to parliament to fund our opulent lifestyles. They sent us to parliament to represent their opinions, their needs, and their livelihoods, and we have immensely failed them,"" she said.
According to her, parliament has been hijacked by parliamentarians who act like the executive and are willing to defend oppressive bills.
""It is time to reclaim parliament from those who think they are the executive and stand up to defend bills from the executive, forgetting their role as parliamentarians. It pains me to see bills that are oppressive and suppressive being championed,"" she said.
She suggests a holistic restructuring rather than a mere reshuffle to solve the ongoing crisis in the country, describing the current state as a torn hem on a garment.
""We need to revisit every government agency, including parliament. The mess that killed our children started in parliament. Reshuffling the cabinet will not solve the main issue,"" she said.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/auma-obama-reacts-after-being-teargassed-in-nairobi-n344644,"Auma Obama reacts after being teargassed in Nairobi
During an interview with CNN’s Larry Madowo, Auma decried why the government ignored the call by the youthful generation on the issue of over-taxation.
She also voiced her frustrations over the brute force and heavy response shown by the police officers on peaceful and unarmed protestors.
“I can’t believe that these young people are just trying to demonstrate for their rights. I came to join them to tell them that they need to use their voices and we’re being teargassed. We have flags and banners, nothing else,” she said.
“How can you teargas your own people? Listen to them. They are the future, 80 per cent of the future and if they decide to turn on you they can and that is what they’re doing now.”
She lauded the youth for their passion in voicing their opinions and exercising their rights.
“These children are doing it on their own, they are not following politicians. We need to listen to them. We are not fighting each other, just listen to them. Part of the things that are going on with this bill is that they’re touching our ancestral land where we bury our people. How can you tax us forever since time immemorial?”
Auma noted that the government should take the plight of the Gen Zs seriously as they account for majority of the population in the country.
“It is not right. These young people have no jobs. We are taxing the jobless and telling them to take a loan. I’m here to tell them I support them. We need to take it seriously,” she added.
Auma and her daughter had joined the wave of youthful protests in Nairobi and other counties to demonstrate against the Finance Bill that is being debated in parliament.
The bill is in the Committee of the Whole House stage whereby each amendment is voted for on a clause-by-clause basis.
During the Parliamentary proceedings on Tuesday, Azimio MPs withdrew their amendments and resolved to reject the Bill in its entirety in solidarity with Gen Zs.
The bill will proceed to Third Reading whereby the lawmakers will vote to either reject or pass the bill. If approved, it is assented into law by President William Ruto.

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/extreme-boss-hussein-sues-fkf-ceo-barry-otieno-for-defamation-n345242,"Extreme boss Hussein sues FKF CEO Barry Otieno for defamation
In March, FKF through Otieno, said Hussein was ineligible to represent the club as per the registration documents presented by the FKF-PL side during the club licensing process.
Through Gedi and Associates Advocates, the Murang’a Seal vice chairman says the words in the letter were malicious, unwarranted and defamatory in nature as they injured his character, personal credit and reputation he has made in grassroot football development, youth empowerment and the fight against drug and substance abuse.
“The effect of the letter was that Hussein Mohammed was subjected to public odium, ridicule, mockery and contempt. His reputation was greatly damaged owing to the immense contribution he has made in grassroot football development, youth empowerment and the fight against drug and substance abuse,” read part of the lawsuit.
The lawsuit added: “The letter was meant to discredit any of his ambitions to run for office at the FKF portraying him as dishonest, incompetent, unethical, untrustworthy, lacks dignity and is selfish.”
“Aggrieved by the net effect of the said letter, Hussein Mohammed has filed a defamation suit against Barry Otieno the General Secretary FKF for General damages, aggravated and/or exemplary damages for putting his name into public odium and disrepute and even despite a demand to tender a public apology, none has been tendered to date.”
There had been a standoff leading to the AGM when Otieno barred Mohammed from the meeting, saying he did not qualify to represent Murang'a Seal while the Extreme Sports CEO and the club insisted he would attend.
“It is important to note that based on the documents submitted during the club licensing registration process, Murang’a Seal is formally registered as Murang’a Sports Excellence Academy Limited. Robert Kenneth Wanyoike Macharia is identified as the sole director of the entity, which is duly recognised as Murang’a Seal for FKF activities,” Otieno said in the letter.
“Hussein Mohammed is, therefore, ineligible to represent Murang’a Seal in the upcoming FKF Annual General Meeting.”
The AGM, which was set for March 16 with the main agenda being to confirm the date for the FKF elections, was however halted by a High Court in Mombasa, thus throwing the polls into uncertainty.

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/englands-decade-of-development-has-its-reward-in-euro-2024-final-n345687,"England's decade of development has its reward in Euro 2024 final
England's progression to a first ever major tournament final on foreign soil at Euro 2024 is the fruit of a decade of work on a player development programme that has turned perennial underachievers into serial contenders.
Ending a 58-year wait to win a major trophy at senior men's international level is the final hurdle left to clear for Gareth Southgate's men in Sunday's final against Spain after serial success at youth level and in the women's game.
Just months after the Three Lions had crashed out of the 2014 World Cup with one game to spare of the group stage, Southgate –- then in his role as under-21 boss –- appeared alongside the English Football Association's technical director Dan Ashworth.
They presented a plan termed ""England DNA"" that had the goal of blending the passion English football was famous for with better technique and a stronger mentality to handle the pressures of major tournament football.
""One of the mantras we have is 'The only thing that changes is the size of the shirt',"" said Ashworth, who was recently appointed Manchester United's sporting director after successful spells at Brighton and Newcastle.
""So as they come through that player pathway, from an under-15 boy or girl, all the way through to the seniors, we have some consistent messages around them.
""If everyone is on the same page and everyone buys into and believes what you are trying to do it can become so much more powerful.""
The results since speak for themselves at every level.
Many of Southgate's squad in Germany have already experienced winning tournaments at youth level.
Anthony Gordon and Cole Palmer were part of the side that beat Spain in the final to win England's first under-21 Euros for 39 years 12 months ago.
Ezri Konsa won the Under-20 World Cup in 2017, while the same year Phil Foden won player of the tournament alongside Marc Guehi and Conor Gallagher in winning the under-17 World Cup.
England's women won their first major tournament on home soil at the Euros in 2022 and followed that up by reaching the World Cup final last year.
""As a football nation we have long been characterised by our passion, fighting spirit and effort,"" Ashworth said at the time.
""Although there are aspects of these characteristics we wish to retain, we do not wish to be solely defined by them.""
The blend of an old fashioned never-say-die attitude with players of a higher technical standard has carried England on a rollercoaster to the Euro 2024 final.
Hyped before the tournament as one of the favourites, Southgate admitted the expectation weighed heavy as his side stumbled through the group stage, scoring just two goals in three games.
They then needed late fightbacks and individual moments of brilliance from Jude Bellingham and Bukayo Saka to keep them alive in sneaking past lower ranked opposition in Slovakia and Switzerland to make the last four.
But in Dortmund against the Dutch, England's decade of planning had its reward in a famous 2-1 semi-final win.
""It will be I would imagine a long time, if ever an English side had 60 percent possession of the ball against a side from the Netherlands. So it shows the more modern England way,"" said a beaming Southgate afterwards.
The ultimate test lies ahead against a Spain side that have swept all before them, including Germany and France on the tougher side of the draw.
England have previously suffered a series of near misses under Southgate.
They defied expectations to reach the semi-finals at the 2018 World Cup before missing out on penalties to Italy in the Euro 2020 final on home soil.
More heartbreak came in Qatar two years ago when Harry Kane ballooned over a late penalty against France in a 2-1 quarter-final defeat.
But that experience has put them in a better place than ever before to become champions of Europe for the first time.
""We're more calm going into the knockout games because the first time we did it in Russia, we hadn't won a knockout game for 10 years,"" added Southgate.
""We hadn't been through the experience. Quarter-finals, semi-finals, we've managed a lot of those games now.
""The last final was the first European Championship final I've ever managed. If I didn't get anything right, apologies for that. I'm going to try and do better this week.""

In the interview, the President was asked if he would join X Spaces to engage the disgruntled youth, the majority of who are Generation Z, and he responded in the affirmative.
He further said the youth can choose the option of identifying a
leader among them who will represent them in talks with the government, or
decide how they want to engage him if they choose to be leaderless.
A section of the youth on the X platform have however vowed to
boycott the conversation with the Head of State, retorting that they have
already made their issues known to him over the course of the protests.

Spanish international midfielder Thiago Alcantara announced his retirement on Monday at the age of 33, through a message on his social networks.
""Thank you, football. And to all who accompanied me and made me a better player and person along the way,"" he wrote on X.
Liverpool released Thiago when his contract expired at the end of last season.
""Technically, he is so, so good,"" said then-manager Jurgen Klopp when the decision was announced. ""A talent who could play in any team in the world and it was a privilege to have him with us.""
""Injuries have been a frustration for him and also for us but the level that he was able to play at when he was available was incredible.""
He was born in Italy, where his father, Mazinho, a member of Brazil's 1994 World Cup winning squad, was playing for Lecce. Thiago's brother Rafinha, a Barcelona born Brazil international, plays in Saudi Arabia.
Thiago started his senior career with Barcelona in 2009, where, among other trophies, he won four Liga titles, the 2011 Champions League and Club World Cup.
He then spent seven years at Bayern Munich winning the Bundesliga every season.
His haul in Munich also included the Club World Cup in 2013 and the Champions League in 2020.
In four years with Liverpool, he won the FA Cup and reached a third Champions League final
Thiago won European under-17 and under-20 titles with Spain and won 46 senior caps Spain between 2011 and 2021 but missed the Euro-2012 triumph with a back injury.
""I will always be willing to give back what I have been given and I am grateful for the time I have enjoyed it,"" said his X post.

Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz defeated close friend Frances Tiafoe in a roller-coaster five sets to reach the Wimbledon last 16 on Friday as Jannik Sinner and Coco Gauff breezed through.
Alcaraz won 5-7, 6-2, 4-6, 7-6 (7/2), 6-2 on the back of 16 aces in his 55 winners in a Centre Court thriller that stretched to the best part of four hours
""Always a big challenge playing against Frances,"" admitted Alcaraz, who was also pushed to five sets by the American in the semi-finals of the 2022 US Open on his way to a first Grand Slam title.
""He is a really talented player, really tough to face.""
Alcaraz, who is bidding to become only the sixth man to capture the French Open and Wimbledon titles back-to-back, has now reached the last 16 of a Slam for the 10th time.
Alcaraz and Tiafoe exchanged a warm embrace at the net.
""Just ultimate respect. Him just saying, 'It's good to see you play like that.' Me just saying, 'I can't stand you,"" joked the American.
World number three Alcaraz will next take on either Ugo Humbert of France or Brandon Nakashima of the United States.
That match was one of four men's third-round clashes that could not be completed due to heavy rain in London.
World number one Sinner needed just 96 minutes to defeat Miomir Kecmanovic of Serbia 6-1, 6-4, 6-2.
Australian Open champion Sinner, a beaten semi-finalist at Wimbledon in 2023, will next face either Canada's Denis Shapovalov or Ben Shelton of the United States.
The win was Sinner's 41st this season, taking him past the 40 of Casper Ruud.
Women's world number two Gauff ended the run of British qualifier Sonay Kartal, who had defied her humble ranking of 298 to reach the third round of a Slam for the first time.
Gauff won 6-4, 6-0, allowing her opponent just eight points in the second set.
Despite the loss, Kartal, who had arrived at the All England Club with just over $18,500 from her 2024 efforts on court, will go away with a windfall of more than $182,000.
""This is my first time playing a British player here so I was little nervous because I knew you'd be for her, which is understandable,"" said Gauff.
""Thankfully you guys were pretty nice to me so that helped.""
Gauff will face American compatriot Emma Navarro for a place in the quarter-finals.
Tommy Paul, the US men's 12th seed, made the fourth round for second time with a 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 win over Alexander Bublik of Kazakhstan.
It was Paul's eighth successive win on grass after he claimed the Queen's Club title on the eve of Wimbledon.
""I'm having fun on the grass,"" said Paul.
Grigor Dimitrov, who was a semi-finalist 10 years ago, defeated 37-year-old Gael Monfils in straight sets.
Two-time quarter-finalist Madison Keys, the 12th seed, reached the second week for the fifth time with a straight-sets win over Marta Kostyuk.
Keys goes on to face French Open runner-up Jasmine Paolini, who had never won a match at Wimbledon before this year.
Seventh-ranked Paolini saw off former US Open champion Bianca Andreescu in straight sets.
Lulu Sun became the first woman from New Zealand since 1959 to reach the last 16 with a straight-sets victory over China's Zhu Lin.
Sun, 23, who had to come through qualifying to make her debut at the All England Club, won 7-6 (7/4), 7-6 (8/6).
Sun, ranked 123, hopes her win will be headline news in Te Anau on New Zealand's South Island where she was born.
The peaceful town boasts a population that hovers around the 3,000 mark.
""Practically more sheep and deer than people,"" joked Sun.
She will next face Emma Raducanu, who reached the last 16 of a major for the first time since her 2021 US Open triumph.
The 21-year-old British star defeated ninth-ranked Maria Sakkari of Greece 6-2, 6-3 for only her second win over a top-10 player.
""Today was really up there with the most fun I've had on a tennis court,"" said Raducanu.
Donna Vekic needed nine match points to defeat Dayana Yastremska of Ukraine 7-6 (7/4), 6-7 (3/7), 6-1 in a shade under three hours.
That match started on Court 18 but was completed under the roof of Court 1, a switch that delighted the 28-year-old Vekic, who next faces Spain's Paula Badosa.

Members of Parliament and county assemblies (MCAs) were among those targeted.
In Nyeri, protesters looted and set fire to the Chieni supermarket. According to reports, the business belongs to Kieni MP Njoroge Wainaina.
Several videos showed the supermarket's premises on fire as the protests that began last week entered their fifth day.
Elsewhere, protesters wreaked havoc at Molo MP Kuria Kimani's home where they reportedly vandalized the home before setting the premises on fire.
Videos seen by Citizen.digital and believed to be from the incident showed plumes of smoke rising from the MP's palatial home.
The protesters also targeted Kapseret Member of Parliament Oscar Sudi, a close ally of the president.
Protesters broke into and looted a swanky nightclub, Timba XO, which is linked to the MP, taking spirits and property of unknown value.
Photos and videos circulated online showed dozens of people, believed to be anti-Finance Bill protesters, carrying bottles of expensive spirits from the premises.
Protesters flooded the county assembly in Nanyuki on Tuesday afternoon, demanding a complete rejection of the Bill, which critics say will burden citizens even more.
In a day marked by heavy gunfire and teagas, protesters descended on National Assembly Majority Leader Kimani Ichungwah's NG-CDF office in Kikuyu, ransacked it, and set it on fire.
Several videos shared on Tuesday also showed Uasin Gishu county headquarterson fire, amid reports that protesters had breached the premises
In Embu county, protesters also raided and wrecked the county assembly offices, with videos shared online showing the assembly offices on fire.
In a related incident, protesters also set on fire, an office belonging to Igembe South MP Paul Mwirigi's office. The legislator was among MPs who voted for the Finance Bill.
And in Machakos, protesting youth invaded the Machakos county assembly security offices, wrecked it before setting it ablaze.
Kenya has a massive debt mountain, and its servicing costs have skyrocketed as the local currency's value has fallen over the last two years, making interest payments on foreign-currency loans more expensive.
The tax increases will put additional strain on Kenyans, with well-paying jobs still out of reach for many young people.
After the government agreed to eliminate levies on bread purchases, car ownership, and financial and mobile services, the Treasury warned of a 200 billion shilling ($1.56 billion) budget shortfall.
The government now intends to increase fuel prices and export taxes to fill the void left by the changes, which critics say will make life more expensive in a country already plagued by high inflation.
Kenya has one of the most dynamic economies in East Africa, but one-third of its 52 million people live in poverty.

The suspected arsonist is said to have locked the door from outside before setting the Mabati structure ablaze using petrol during the 2 am incident.
Ten other nearby houses were also burnt with occupants losing all their belongings despite efforts from the Kisumu fire department to put out the fire.
Distraught neighbours this morning recounted events leading to the heinous act saying they suspect the incident was triggered by a love triangle.
Neighbours say the mother, who is a vegetable vendor in the nearby Nyamasaria market was burnt beyond recognition alongside her three kids.
Reports indicate that the man suspected to be behind the arson is said to have sometime last year also attempted to burn the woman inside her house.
James Odondo who is the Manyatta A location chief confirmed the incident saying the four bodies were taken to JOOTRH morgue.

Similarly, the petition seeks an interpretation of the implication of the President's recommendation to ""delete all clauses.""
The petitioner, Kennedy Odour Wanyanga, contends that Articles 255, 256, and 257 of the Kenyan Constitution of 2010 provide mechanisms for amending any provisions of the Constitution, and that Parliament cannot amend any provision through Standing Orders or alter any such Constitutional timelines as sanctioned by the Kenyan Constitution of 2010.
""The President's actions have occasioned a peculiar scenario not contemplated by the law, which is to the effect that Parliament is to delete a Bill already passed by the House, whereas the law as designed does not anticipate the withdrawal of a Bill after the second reading.""
The Petitioner, through lawyer Arnold Oginga, seeks an interpretation of Article 115 of the Constitution regarding the status of the Finance Bill, 2024 after 14 days from the date of the President's Memo of June 26, 2024, and the effect of the National Assembly's recess.
The Petitioner also questions the constitutionality of Standing Orders of the National Assembly, which allow the National Assembly to go on break in the middle of legislative timelines under Article 115.
He is also seeking a declaration that the Finance Bill, 2024, will not take effect after 14 days, as well as an order for the National Assembly to cancel the break and act on the President's referral in his Memo.
He argues that the Finance Bill is in limbo and continues to stay in a statue of uncertainty, adding that the referral has not only delayed its enactment but has also caused further uncertainty about its status.
""The President's reservations herein are ambiguous following the recommendation for deletion of the Clauses, and as a result, the resultant product will be ambiguous and a nullity in law,"" reads court documents.
Justice Bahati Mwamuye directed the parties to file, serve, and appear for further orders and/or directions on October 7, 2024.

Odinga condemned the violence witnessed in the country on Wednesday, stating that those responsible must be held accountable.
The Azimio chief called for an end to the violence, emphasising that the scenes of Tuesday's protests represent a double betrayal of the youth.
“What started as an expression of disaffection with the government by young Kenyans through peaceful protests and the presentation of petitions to authorities degenerated into chaos and mayhem yesterday,” he stated.
“People who were clearly not the Gen Z that started the initial protests hijacked it, looted businesses, attacked innocent Kenyans and destroyed critical infrastructure.”
He added: “For thugs to hijack the protests and turn them into mayhem against innocent Kenyans amounts to a double betrayal of the youth. The bad manners have to be stopped.”
Odinga says that the peaceful protests which started against the Finance Bill 2024 have already taken a U-turn and are no longer civil or a reflection of the demands of the Gen Zs.
He noted that cases of vandalism, robbery and even rape have been reported in different parts of the nation.
“The young people who started the protests were out to correct the injustices in the country and in the process educate all of us that protests can be peaceful, and civil and still achieve the intended goals.
“ There are reports of innocent women being harassed and raped in some parts of the country…The scenes of people looting, vandalizing and robbing were way different from what was witnessed at the start of the protests when Gen Z was in complete control of the process and its programs.”
In light of the condemnation, Odinga expressed sympathy to the people affected by the violence pointing out that most of them whose shops were looted were now worse than before the protests.
The Azimio leader also called for accountability from security agencies over the violence meted on protesters.
""I extend deep sympathy to the families who've suffered at the hands of looters posing as Gen Z protestors, innocent people who've seen their business premises broken into, their products looted and who now face the reality of being worse off than before the protests,"" he said.
""We have had occasion to condemn police brutality on peaceful protestors and we continue to demand civility and accountability from security officers during protests.""

Imagine a canvas where patches of different hues paint a unique story of each individual. Vitiligo, often misunderstood, strips away pigment from the skin, leaving behind a mosaic that defies societal norms. But within this mosaic lies a powerful message: beauty transcends uniformity.
Beyond its physical impact, vitiligo can provoke stares and stigma. Yet, those affected are rewriting the narrative. They're embracing their skin's evolving landscape, proudly sharing their journeys, and reshaping perceptions. Through social media movements and community events, World Vitiligo Day empowers individuals to stand tall and celebrate their uniqueness.
While the quest for a cure continues, this day emphasizes education and understanding. It challenges us to see beauty in diversity, to appreciate the stories etched on every skin canvas. It's a reminder that differences should be celebrated, not shunned.
Let's paint the world with acceptance, understanding, and a vibrant spectrum of stories that reflect our shared humanity. Because true beauty lies not in uniformity, but in the colorful tapestry of our differences.

England manager Gareth Southgate is confident his side will embrace the pressure of the knockout stages at Euro 2024 after failing to fire in their three group games.
The Three Lions face Slovakia in the last 16 on Sunday with expectation even further ramped up as they find themselves on what is perceived to be the easier side of the draw.
England topped Group C despite underwhelming displays from one of the pre-tournament favourites as they beat Serbia 1-0 and drew with Denmark and Slovenia.
But Southgate's side have put disappointing performances in the group stage behind them before when reaching the Euro 2020 final and semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup.
""Now you're into that world of it has to happen on the day, you've got to go for it. We've been here before, many times, we know what it entails,"" said Southgate at his pre-match press conference.
""The fact is you go into a different mental state. Everybody knows that knockout football is jeopardy.
""Everybody knows that on a given day an opponent can make it really tough for you. You know the quality of the opposition left is high, so it changes the mindset.
""It's about how far can we go. We're trying to achieve something exceptional, but it's a step at a time and tomorrow is a chance to improve aspects of our game.""
Southgate's future appears in doubt no matter the outcome in Germany.
Despite reaching a final, semi-final and quarter-final in his three major tournaments in charge, the former Middlesbrough boss still has plenty of critics back home.
He was pelted by beer cups thrown from the stands as some fans voiced their frustrations following a 0-0 draw against Slovenia on Tuesday.
Southgate, whose contract is set to expire at the end of the year, will manage England for the 99th time against Slovakia.
But he played down the importance of his future and potentially reaching a century of games in charge should England progress to a quarter-final against Switzerland.
""I'm just desperate to do well for my country. Lead this group of players and staff, who I absolutely love working with and think so much of,"" added Southgate.
""Lead them through what could be another brilliant night and create some more memories for our supporters.""
Kane 'enjoys' the big stage
Harry Kane netted one of England's two goals so far against Denmark, but that is the only time in his last three international tournaments that he has scored in the group stage.
By contrast, the England captain has six goals in his last six knockout games and is confident he will grow into the tournament again.
""Naturally you get physically stronger, naturally you get sharper as you play more games,"" said Kane.
""A lot of the players come into their peak sharpness at the knockout stage and that's what I've found in, especially, recent tournaments as well.
""Ultimately I enjoy these games. Knockout football is a different prospect to the group stage. We've done well in the past and now it's time to do that again.""
England have a clean bill of health but Luke Shaw is not fit to start as he has not played a minute for club or country since February.
Kobbie Mainoo is expected to replace Conor Gallagher in midfield, while wingers Anthony Gordon and Cole Palmer are in contention to start should Southgate shuffle his misfiring frontline.

FILES: Soccer Football - FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 - Group A - Netherlands v Ecuador - Khalifa International Stadium, Doha, Qatar - November 25, 2022 Netherlands' Cody Gakpo celebrates scoring their first goal with Daley Blind REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko
Cody Gakpo and Arda Guler endured frustrating seasons but both have established themselves as their teams' vital players as the Netherlands face Turkey in a Euro 2024 quarter-final clash on Saturday in Berlin.
Netherlands won the competition for the first and only time in 1988, with Ronald Koeman, Ruud Gullit, Frank Rijkaard and Marco van Basten among a talented squad.
The current roster is less illustrious but Liverpool left winger Gakpo, 25, is successfully staking his claim to be their leading light, with three goals this summer.
""Gakpo is our star,"" former Netherlands international Pierre van Hooijdonk said on Dutch channel NOS.
Overshadowed by Mohamed Salah at Anfield, where he has played inconsistently, Gakpo has burst into life in Germany as a constant threat coming in off the left.
Half of the forward's 12 goals for his country have come at major tournaments, with three at the World Cup two years ago.
With another he will match compatriots and former stars Ruud van Nistelrooy and Arjen Robben on seven.
""He is a great player who is solid on the ball... and super important for us,"" said Koeman after the 3-0 last 16 win over Romania, in which Gakpo scored and also brilliantly teed up Donyell Malen.
""He is one of the players with extra qualities and fortunately he makes the difference at moments like this.""
In Gakpo's way is Turkey goalkeeper Mert Gunok, whose sensational last-minute save to claw out Christoph Baumgartner's header was compared to Gordon Banks denying Pele at the 1970 World Cup.
At the other end, Real Madrid attacker Guler is Turkey's main weapon.
After months of injury problems and struggling to earn a chance in the Spanish capital, Guler burst into life in the final weeks of the season.
With the Spanish title won, Carlo Ancelotti let Guler loose and he blossomed at the perfect time to take the creative controls for Turkey this summer.
The 19-year-old scored a stunning effort against Georgia in Turkey's thrilling opening win and created both of his team's goals against Austria in the 2-1 last 16 win with set pieces.
""He put in a great performance and he ran like he's never done before in his career, and I'm proud of that too,"" said Turkey coach Vincenzo Montella.
It is only the fourth time Turkey have reached the quarter-finals of a major tournament and the first since 2008. They are boosted by the return of captain Hakan Calhanoglu and defender Samet Akaydin from suspension.
In the stands at the vast Olympiastadion Turkey have the advantage, despite Oranje fans taking over every city they have visited in their vibrant shirts.
""It will be an away match,"" Netherlands defender Daley Blind warned his team-mates on Thursday, with around three million Turks living in Germany, many supporting their team fervently.
They may not be able to watch their last 16 hero Merih Demiral who is under UEFA investigation for an alleged ultra-nationalist salute during his country's triumph against Austria.
The defender scored both of Turkey's goals but while celebrating the second he made a gesture associated with a far-right extremist group known as the Grey Wolves.
A Demiral ban would be a signficant blow for Montella's side, already missing the suspended Orkun Kokcu and Ismail Yuksek - by contrast the Netherlands have their full complement available.
Koeman helped his team recover after their 3-2 defeat by Austria in the final group game, which the coach labelled ""appalling"" and meant they only progressed as one of the best third-place finishers.
Gakpo and Malen's goals dispatched Romania and Koeman, who captained the side to glory 36 years ago, is hoping the Dutch have now found their feet.
""This is the level -- if we dip, we don't reach the final,"" said the former Barcelona coach bluntly.
Gakpo is hoping for further improvement still. ""We are not yet where we want to be,"" remarked the winger.
If Netherlands can get through their Turkey test then fans can start dreaming of a second Euros triumph, with England or Switzerland awaiting in the semi-final in what has been dubbed the ""easier"" side of the draw.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/sifuna-explains-contention-around-conflict-of-interest-bill-n345595,"Sifuna explains contention around Conflict of Interest Bill
Nairobi Senator Edwin Sifuna has criticised
the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) for what he describes as
sensationalising the debate around the Conflict of Interest Bill, 2024.
The proposed law to be administered by EACC
seeks to reduce the risk of corruption, favouritism and bias in the public
service by ensuring no public or state officers are involved in matters that
conflict of interest.
In an interview on Spice FM on Wednesday,
Sifuna dismissed the corruption watchdog’s claim that senators have removed
clauses from the Bill which will impede the war on graft.
Instead, Sifuna explained that conflict of
interest in public service is covered by multiple acts in the Constitution,
which he described as redundant.
According to the senator, the amendments
are meant to consolidate the laws into a single law by deleting some clauses
to avoid ambiguity and repetition, without exempting anyone from legal scrutiny
or punishment.
“When you come up with a law specifically
to deal with conflict of interest, you will see references to deletion of
clauses in other laws,” Sifuna said.
Among the laws proposed for deletion is
Section 42 of the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act which governs the
prosecution of public officers involved in conflict of interest like trading with
the government.
“EACC claims that because of these Senate amendments,
the war on graft is lost… if anything we do not need the bill. The problem with
Kenya is not the absence of laws. Even with existing laws, what EACC should be
telling us is where we need to tighten to better implement these things,” added
Sifuna.
He argued that this section is vague, as it
does not explicitly define an agent and a principal. Sifuna said the proposed law seeks to clarify who is liable and for what.
The senator cited Section 11 of the Public
Officer Act, which prohibits public officers from using their positions for
personal enrichment, and Section 46 of the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes
Act, which similarly states that using one’s office to improperly benefit
oneself or others is an offence.
“We have invited EACC to the Senate for a conversation
to convince us of the need for all these duplicitous laws to exist,” said Sifuna.
Senators on May 16 voted to amend the Conflict
of Interest Bill, 2023, a move seen as watering down of the Constitution’s
stringent clauses governing graft.
Sifuna himself received backlash for voting
in support of the Bill.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/ksl-student-leader-joshua-okayo-narrates-harrowing-ordeal-under-abductors-n345561,"KSL student leader Joshua Okayo narrates harrowing ordeal under abductors
Kenya School of Law (KSL) student council
president Joshua Okayo has come out to narrate his experience in the hands of
abductors at the height of the nationwide anti-Finance Bill 2024 demonstrations.
Okayo said he was abducted on Wednesday, June 26 near
his residence in Ongata Rongai, Kajiado County. He was on Saturday, June 29 found
dumped near the Maragua River in Murang’a County.
In a new interview with NTV, the student
leader, who was among the vocal youth protesting President William Ruto’s government's
unpopular draft law, says he had been warned by three people that unnamed
people were looking for him.
He says he was advised to stay away from
his neighbourhood and lay low.
Okayo narrates how, as he was walking near
his house, a man unknown to him invited him to greet three others whom the
stranger called KSL comrades, to which he agreed.
He, however, soon realised that the
so-called comrades were abductors after they captured, blindfolded, cuffed and
forced him into a nearby car before driving off.
“They asked me, why are you demonstrating? I
didn’t want to engage them, but I said it was in solidarity with other Kenyans.
They asked me who our mobilisers were; and who was printing the protest
materials. I told them no one was funding us,” Okayo says in the interview.
He says they pressed him about a statement he
had issued calling for the release of two students arrested in the protests.
The abductors, Okayo adds, also asked who
was giving them information about the International Monetary Fund (IMF)’s hand in the controversial Finance Bill.
He says all this while, they had confiscated
his phone. Okayo says he was then taken out of the car and forced into a room,
where his abductors left him.
“When they returned later, they began
hitting my ankles with metal rods, asking me the same questions. I was still
blindfolded. They asked me what we stood to gain from all this. My answers were
not helpful so they left me there again,” he narrates.
“I was thirsty and hungry, but when I asked
them for water, they denied me and said I had to tell them who our informants
and financiers were.”
He says in between the torture, they would
leave him and return with the same questions until they eventually took him out
of the room into a car.
“They drove me around, strangling me and
hitting me in my chest and ankles with the metal rods. They then just threw me out
of the car and I rolled to the roadside,” a teary Okayo recounts.
“I lay there weak and sleepy until I was
woken up to find a large crowd of villagers around me, speaking Kikuyu. I could
not communicate properly but I just told them ‘Nairobi’.”
The student leader says he kept phone numbers
on a piece of paper in his pockets following the warnings he received on his looming
abduction.
The villagers found it and called his
brother who told the villagers to take him to the hospital.
After he was found near the river that
Saturday, Okayo reportedly appeared to have been tortured. He was taken to
Avenue Hospital in Thika and put under close observation due to the
psychological trauma of the ordeal.
He claims his abductors took off his SIM
cards from his phone, withdrew money from his mobile money wallet and uninstalled
WhatsApp.
Law Society of Kenya (LSK) President Faith
Odhiambo condemned the abductions blamed on members of the police force,
drawing parallels to the authoritarian era of the late former President Daniel
Moi.
""This is shocking! I feel like we are
going back to the Moi era; the last we heard of abductions and torture
chambers. Our country is singing about and, in the region, people are praising
Kenyans such abductions coming back. Some of the abducted persons have been
released but others remain unaccounted for,"" Odhiambo told Citizen TV.
Thirty-nine people were killed in the
demonstrations between June 18 and July 1, according to the Kenya National
Commission on Human Rights, which reported 361 injuries, 32 cases of
""enforced or involuntary disappearances"" and 627 arrests of
protesters.
President Ruto later declined to assent to
the Bill after mounting public pressure, instead announcing austerity measures to
cover the budgetary provisions that the Bill sought to raise through increased
taxation.
But his government has denied that police
officers were involved in abductions and even defended the conduct of plainclothes
police officers, who were linked to the abductions and killings.
Interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki on
Tuesday said the government would take action against “claims of abductions and
enforced disappearances allegedly perpetrated by security personnel” during the
protests.
While Kindiki did not outline any specific
cases, he said investigative agencies had since launched a probe into the
matter.
“Independent constitutional and statutory
agencies will investigate and prosecute any person or official who may be
implicated with violating the Constitution by perpetrating confinement of any
person outside the law,” the security minister said in a statement.

Ayan Salad, Nasro Mahad Salad, Ismail Mahad Mohamed, Ahmed Muhamed Farah and Abdlaziz Salad Ali appeared before Eldoret Senior Resident Magistrate Mogire Onkoba on Wednesday and denied the charges through a court interpreter.
They were arrested on June 29 by police officers based at Tarakwa police station along the Eldoret-Nakuru highway while being ferried in a tinted car registration number KCZ 911 R, Toyota Voxy black in color.
Police Constable Phanuel Kaaria, who is the inspecting officer in the matter, asked the court to give them until Monday to complete their investigations against the accused persons that will cover among others, their nationality and mission in the country.
According to court documents, the accused persons were travelling from Malaba border to Nairobi when the police officers flagged them down at a roadblock that had been erected at the road.
The driver stopped a few metres away before jumping out of the vehicle and fled on foot leaving behind the accused persons.
Kaaria further told the court that they are yet to submit the mobile phones they confiscated from the accused persons to Anti-Terrorism Police Unit Information Communication and Technology laboratory for forensic analysis in Nairobi.
Onkoba ruled that the case will come up for mention on Monday when he will give further directions.

Principal Secretaries (PS') will oversee
daily government operations following the Thursday dissolution of Cabinet by
President William Ruto.
In a Nation address at State House,
Nairobi, Ruto underscored that his administration will maintain normal
functioning despite the ousting of all Cabinet members except Deputy President
Rigathi Gachagua and Prime Cabinet Secretary and Foreign Affairs CS Musalia Mudavadi.
""During this process, the
operations of government will continue uninterrupted under the guidance of PS
and other relevant officials. I will be announcing additional measures and
steps in due course,"" President Ruto said.
Ruto added that he plans to promptly
initiate thorough discussions with Kenyans and key stakeholders as he considers
his next move to assemble a new Cabinet. However, he did not specify when he
would announce the composition of the new Cabinet.
""I will immediately engage in
extensive consultations across different sectors and political formations and
other Kenyans both in public and private with the aim of setting up a broad
base government that will assist me in accelerating and expediting the
necessary and irreversible implementation of the program that we have,""
Ruto said.
""This includes other radical
measures and programmes, to deal with the burden of debt, to explore
raising domestic resources and revenues, expanding job opportunities,
eliminating wastage and unnecessary duplication, over multiplicity of
government agencies and slaying the dragon of corruption and consequently
making the government of Kenya, lean, inexpensive, effective and efficient.""
Ruto's announcement mirrors that of the
late former President Mwai Kibaki, who in November 2005 disbanded his entire
Cabinet after a humiliating defeat in the government-supported 2005 referendum.
“Following the results of the
Referendum, it has become necessary for me, as the President of the Republic,
to reorganise my Government to make it more cohesive and better able to serve
the people of Kenya,” Kibaki said then.
“I have directed that the Offices of all
Ministers and all Assistant Ministers become vacant. Consequently, the
occupants of the said offices cease to hold their respective offices with
immediate effect.""
Kibaki subsequently
announced a new Cabinet lineup two weeks later.

https://www.citizen.digital/business/kenyas-credit-rating-downgraded-after-finance-bill-2024-rejection-n345534,"Kenya’s credit rating downgraded after Finance Bill 2024 rejection
When Moody’s Rating Committee sat a week ago
on the second of July, it was Kenya’s debt rating on the table for dissection.
At the end of the meeting, Kenya had moved
from B3 status into very high credit risk, which they call Caa1, and with a
negative outlook.
This now means that the country’s risk of
default is presumed to have gone up.
Economist Johnson Nderi says: “Moody’s is a
credit rating agency, a global credit rating agency; they rate sovereign and corporate
debt. They are typically a source of information for investors who want to know
how creditworthy a sovereign or corporate entity is.”
The decision to downgrade Kenya came shortly
after the withdrawal of Finance Bill, 2024, with Moody’s saying it was driven
by the country’s diminished capacity to implement revenue-based fiscal
consolidation.
This, they say, would have improved debt
affordability, placing it on a downward trend.
Moody’s also said that the government’s
decision to cut back on expenditure instead of increasing taxes will affect the
country’s financing needs.
The global rating agency has also taken note
of that the heightened social tensions in the country over the last two weeks,
while acknowledging that the government will not be able to introduce
significant revenue-raising measures in the foreseeable future.
However, economists say this downgrade has
come prematurely.
Odhiambo Ramogi, MD of Elim Capital Ltd,
says: “When governments are in the process of making budgets, it is expected
that there will be pull and push, especially in our situation where this
government has pushed the taxes upwards in the last few months and years. And
so, it was expected that there would be feedback in the negative about it. And
what you do is you wait it out, and then afterwards you can review with the
full information.”
This new rating, and Moody's negative outlook
for the country, is likely to further increase borrowing costs for the
cash-strapped government.
Should the government opt to shun the
international market and borrow domestically, experts say this could lead to an
increase in interest rates.
The government is in a catch-22 yet again,
with rising debt obligations and an inability to raise more tax revenue. So
what options does the government have?
“I think they need to focus on production,
they need to put their money where their mouth is. Because if you focus on
production in a few months’ time then the revenue will turn around. You see, in
agriculture, you only need a few months, but even if we have ourselves one year
of good investment in agriculture, at a time like this next year we will not be
talking about high inflation, we’ll not be talking about our importation of
food, we’ll have significantly affected our balance of payments and affected our
currency,” Ramogi added.
Nderi noted: “The government ideally ought to
have, to keep spending below tax revenue, so that the additional money can go
towards paying down debt. Right now, what we are doing is we are borrowing to
pay both interest and principal.”

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/toney-urges-england-to-kick-on-after-euros-reprieve-n345154,"Toney urges England to kick on after Euros reprieve
England striker Ivan Toney said the Three Lions must seize
the second chance handed to them at Euro 2024 by a remarkable late fightback
against Slovakia to reach the quarter-finals.
Jude Bellingham's overhead kick five minutes into stoppage time
prevented Gareth Southgate's much-hyped side from an embarrassing early exit in
the last 16.
Toney, in his first appearance at the tournament as a late
substitute, then teed up Harry Kane to head in the winner in extra-time to set
up a meeting with Switzerland in the last eight on Saturday.
""I think that was kind of like eye opening, you could be
going home any minute,"" Toney said a press conference on Wednesday.
""The relief after in the dressing room was kind of like
'right now boys, it's time to kick on'.
""I think we've got the character and the quality of players
in the dressing room to do so.""
Bellingham hit out at England's critics after the game, saying he
had to put up with ""rubbish"" in the media after struggling in the
previous two games against Denmark and Serbia.
Southgate also bemoaned an ""usual atmosphere"" after beer
cups were thrown at him in the aftermath of a 0-0 draw against Slovenia, which
secured top spot in Group C and progression to the knockout stages.
England arrived in Germany as one of the favourites for the
competition thanks to a richly-talented squad that includes the Bundesliga's
top goalscorer in Kane, Real Madrid star Bellingham and Phil Foden, who won
accolades as the Premier League's player of the year last season.
However, they are just one of a number of fancied sides, also
including France and Portugal, who have advanced to the last eight despite
underwhelming performances.
""There is always going to be an expectation and there's a lot
of people that will always have their opinion,"" Toney said.
""If we win 2-0, people say we should have won 3-0, 4-0, but
that's always the case. We're two games away from a major final and we've just
got to do what we can to do it and hopefully it'll be enough.""
Southgate admitted after the Slovakia game that Toney had been
annoyed at him for being introduced deep into stoppage time.
The Brentford striker said he had to ""control his
emotions"" to reset and play a major role in extra-time in both getting
England in front and then seeing the game out.
""By winning,"" said Toney on how he and Southgate
reconciled. ""Every player is going to have the hump not playing games,
especially when there is one minute to go.
All
of Southgate's 26-man squad trained on Wednesday with left-back Luke Shaw
hoping to be fit to feature for the first time since February against the Swiss
in Duesseldorf.

The Anti-Doping Agency
of Kenya (ADAK) is determined to deliver a clean team to the forthcoming 2024
Olympic Games.
ADAK Head of
Anti-Doping Education and Research Dr. Martin Sisa noted that the Agency has
already done mandatory testing to all teams headed to the 2024 Summer Games in
Paris.
Dr. Sisa revealed that
the testing started in September last year through to the stipulated World
Athletics deadline on July 4.
Speaking during the ongoing
Sports Journalists Association of Kenya (SJAK) Anti -Doping Seminar, Dr. Sisa
added that ADAK has already tested more than 4135 athletes and reached out to
8500 stakeholders in athletics alone.
He noted that ADAK has
also tested 1348 athletes in other disciplines and reached 16,512 stakeholders,
by and large.
Dr Sisa clarified that
athletics has been tested more than other disciplines given the fact that it
had been categorized as a high-risk sport.
“We have been working
closely with the WADA Africa office who have been very supportive to our
programs. We are also working hand in hand with the regional anti-doping
organization to advance the fight against doping,” said Dr Sisa.
“We have been doing a
lot of testing for athletes over the past one year to ensure that we deliver a
clean team to the Olympics. We have also undertaken both testing and education
for the athletes and their entourages and the program is taking shape
considerably well,” he expounded.
“We have tested more numbers compared to other
anti-doping originations globally and there are athletes who have been tested
more than thrice just to ensure that all is well. We wanted to do an
out-of-competition testing ostensibly to deliver an intelligence-based testing,”
added Sisa.
Dr Sisa added that
they are helping the Olympic team by visiting them in their camps for testing
and sensitizing them on anti-doping “in order to deliver a clean sport and
indeed avert the myriad cases witnessed during the Rio Olympics in 2016.”
SJAK President James
Waindi, on his part, thanked ADAK for their unwavering support and partnership
with sports scribes over the years.
“It’s a great honor to
be here again. We thank ADAK for making this workshop an annual event. This
year’s workshop is particularly a significant one given that this is an Olympic
year and that journalists need a lot of education in understanding the dynamics
of doping.”
ADAK CEO Sarah
Shibutse, whose speech was read by Dr. Sisa, underscored the input of sports
scribes as key stakeholders in the campaign against doping.
“Journalists can contribute to the fight by exposing doping scandals through investigative journalism and uncover doping practices, often bringing hidden issues to light. By exposing these scandals, they can prompt action from sports authorities and the government,” said Shibutse.

Siaya Governor James Orengo now wants
President William Ruto to resign, arguing that there is too much public anger against
the Kenya Kwanza government.
He says that if President Ruto was
listening to the people's mood in the country, he could resign because Kenyans
are fed up with the current administration.
“If Ruto was listening to the mood of
Kenyans. Talking to him will not resolve anything; there is too much anger
against the Kenya Kwanza administration. If he is truly a Christian, he should
just resign with this entire government,” Orengo said on Sunday.
Speaking in Bondo, the governor stated that
in his estimation, the entire Kenya Kwanza government has failed Kenyans, made
them angry and that it should to vacate office in its entirety.
“We can have international institutions to
assist us, just like 2002 and 2007, to bring new processes that will enable our
transition from this autocratic government to a new dispensation,” Orengo
added.
Following the scrapping of the unpopular 2024
Finance Bill after deadly nationwide protests – which Ruto has warned will make
Kenya resort to borrowing to sustain its expenditure – Orengo said Kenyans must
now brace for head times ahead.
Orengo observed that government services will
tremendously decrease.
President Ruto on Sunday painted a bleak picture of the country's future, following the rejection of the Bill, saying Kenya
has gone back two years and will need to borrow at least Ksh.1.2 trillion this
year to keep the government operational.
He told a media roundtable at State House, Nairobi that dropping the Finance Bill means the government will be unable to, for instance, confirm 46,000 Junior Secondary School teachers on a permanent and pensionable basis.

Titled County Governments Budget Implementation Review, the report highlights how the counties spent the allocated budget during the specified period and the challenges encountered.
COB Margaret Nyakang'o noted that county governments operated over 1,400 illegal bank accounts, making it difficulty for her office to track public expenditure.
According to Section 82 of the Public Finance Management (County Governments) Regulations, 2015, bank accounts belonging to county governments must be opened and maintained at the Central Bank of Kenya for accountability and transparency in their operations.
The only exemption in the clause refers to when county governments open accounts used for small routine expenses within the organisation (petty cash imprest accounts).
""For avoidance of doubt, all county government bank accounts shall be opened at the Central Bank of Kenya except for imprest bank accounts for petty cash,"" reads part of the regulations.
In the report, Bungoma led with 321 illegal bank accounts followed by Migori (208), Kwale (165) and Nyandarua (88).
Counties in the Mt Kenya region such as Kiambu, Embu and Murang'a operated 52, 37 and 37 illegal accounts respectively.
""The growing number of bank accounts operated by counties in commercial banks has made it more difficult for the Office of the Controller of Budget to track public expenditure,""
Data from Nairobi County was missing as the COB explained that the required information was not availed by the county government.
COB Nyakang'o advised the County Executive Committee members responsible for Finance to ensure compliance with the law by maintaining the accounts at the Central Bank of Kenya.

The six persons were found guilty of killing the former MP in 2013 at a club in Thika.
The court ruled that the former legislator was poisoned.
""In the end, I sentence each accused person, 1 through 6, to serve 15 years' imprisonment...,"" the court ruled.
The six individuals are Paul Wainaina Boiyo, Christopher Lumbasio Andika, Andrew Karanja Wainaina, Samuel Kuria Ngugi, Esther Ndinda Mulinge, and Ruth Vanessa Irungu.
The court spared them the maximum sentence, noting positive attributes from the probation report and stating they did not deserve the sentence provided by law.
""The role of the court is to balance the scales of justice... I will factor in the period they have stayed in custody,"" the court noted.
During mitigation, Thuo's wife was given an opportunity to speak. She told the court that her husband was poisoned and his death had robbed her of a partner and father to her children.

According to the Head of State, Kenya has gone back two years and will need to borrow at least Ksh.1.2 trillion this year to keep the government operational.
""We have dropped the Finance Bill. What does that mean? It means we have gone back almost 2 years,"" President Ruto told journalists at State House on Sunday.
""It means that this year we are going to borrow 1 trillion shillings to be able to run our government.""
President Ruto told the Presidential roundtable that dropping the Finance Bill means the government will be unable to confirm 46,000 Junior Secondary School teachers on permanent and pensionable contracts.
He stated that without the funds that his administration hoped to raise, it will be impossible to assist Kenyan farmers in ensuring they receive at least Ksh.50 per litre of milk.
""It means we can not help our farmers get a return of Ksh.50 per lire of milk, we can not pay coffee farmers' debs, we can not support the cherry fund, and we can not help Mumias farmers with their debts,"" he said.
President Ruto announced last Wednesday that he would not sign the contentious Finance Bill into law, following days of growing unrest and protests in more than 15 counties.
The bill was intended to generate 346 billion Kenyan shillings ($2.68 billion), or 3% of GDP, in additional revenue.
Kenya agreed a four-year loan with the IMF in 2021, and signed on for additional lending to support climate change measures in May 2023, taking its total IMF loan access to $3.6 billion.
The IMF requires regular reviews of reforms - in Kenya's case every six months - before it releases tranches of funding.
Kenya reached a staff level agreement with the IMF earlier this month on a seventh review - before President William Ruto abandoned the tax bill on Wednesday - even then warning of revenue shortfalls. The review in theory paves the way for $976 million, but it had not secured crucial IMF board sign-off.
""There isn't a great deal of room to manoeuvre unless you really start doing much more thorough reviews"" of spending, said Giulia Pelligrini, senior portfolio manager with Allianz Global Investors, of what Kenya can do to meet targets. ""So it's going to be difficult.""
She added that a mix of government spending cuts, and flexibility from the IMF on programme targets, was the likely outcome.
Kenya's sovereign dollar bonds slid after Ruto's u-turn. Morgan Stanley said that with eurobond yields back above 10%, Kenya had limited access to international bonds, which could push them to borrow more locally.

The opposition Azimio la Umoja One Kenya coalition party is now threatening to push for criminal charges at the International Criminal Court (ICC) over the killings of protestors during the two weeks of anti-Finance Bill protests.
Led
by Wiper boss Kalonzo Musyoka, the leaders on Friday said the atrocities
meted on protestors by the police amount to crimes against humanity, charges
preferable to the ICC.
They
also raised major concerns over the abduction of protestors.
“We
have a nation that is deeply troubled, and insecure and I don’t think there is
any Kenyan who is feeling happy today and I don’t think even Ruto is happy
because of how shocked he was,” said Kalonzo.
“As
a parent, how does he wake up every morning and imagine what happened and yet
not a word since the happenings on Tuesday from the so-called government
spokesperson.”
The remarks came after Azimio leaders and the Law
Society of Kenya (LSK) handed over a report on 39 missing persons from the
anti-Finance Bill 2024 protests to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations
(DCI).
LSK
and Azimio said they continue to receive reports from families of people who
participated in the protests and cannot be accounted for.
Rarieda MP Otiende Amollo stated: “We gave (DCI) a list of almost 39 people who had been reported to us as MPs or as the LSK as missing; many of them were held incommunicado.”

A section of farmers from Topoti village in Narok North Constituency held demonstrations on Friday to protest against a road levy imposed by the county government.
Taking to the streets with their tools of trade and placards, the group decried the poor state of roads, adding that they would not pay any more levies above what they already remit to the county.
Led by their chairman Joseph Ole Naimodu, about 2,000 farmers blocked a section of the road from Topoti-Mwiso area.
Naimodu said, “It has become increasingly difficult for us to do our business because we have to keep paying levies, yet we are not provided with proper infrastructure.”
Daniel Naimuny, a farmer, said, it is hard to sustain business when levies keep being imposed on traders, yet there is corresponding infrastructure to show for the levies.
The group also complained about unstable power supply, which has disrupted businesses such as barbershops.
The farmers said they will continue to hold protests until their grievances are resolved.

He noted that the current economic woes affecting Kenyans are caused by the high interest rates instituted by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), which have a ripple effect on the cost of living.
He appealed to Central Bank of Kenya governor Kamau Thugge to lower the interest rates to allow for a more conducive environment and increase the taxpayer's purchasing power.
""You can't threaten Kenyans with penalties for not registering with SHIF or in case there's a delay or default in payment. I recommend CBK Governor Kamau Thugge to reduce rates because we can't be working towards paying banks. Banks should stop doing business with banks,"" he said.
""Currently, we're having increased CBK rates, the bank takes our money, goes to gov't which doesn't make the environment conducive so we're paying more for all the things.""
During the interview, Dr. Kigondu also defended the OccupyMOH protests that has seen hundreds of medical, dental and pharmacy interns storm the Ministry of Health headquarters while demanding Health CS Susan Nakhumicha's resignation.
He reiterated that the association would pitch camp outside MOH until the interns are posted and their grievances are heard.
The government's commitment to achieving universal health coverage will be anchored on SHIF that will repeal the current National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF).
The Fund, which is set to begin in October, will see employed Kenyans part with 2.75 per cent of their salaries in monthly deductions while those in the informal sector pay Ksh.500 monthly.
The Fund will be mandatory for all Kenyans unlike NHIF whereby those informal sector made voluntary contributions. Through the mass registration drive, which began on July 1, 2024, the government targets over 17 million youths who are currently not registered as NHIF members.

Outstanding Norwegian middle-distance runner Jakob Ingebrigtsen heads to the Paris Olympics as a hot favourite in both the 1500m and 5,000m.
With typically brash confidence, Ingebrigtsen says the Summer Games in the French capital should be a ""walk in the park"".
Yet he will have to shut out domestic strife in a family once documented in a reality TV series as a tightly-melded unit who ate together and trained together.
Jakob's father Gjert, who used to coach him and his brothers, is under investigation for domestic violence.
Outstanding Norwegian middle-distance runner Jakob Ingebrigtsen heads to the Paris Olympics as a hot favourite in both the 1500m and 5,000m.
With typically brash confidence, Ingebrigtsen says the Summer Games in the French capital should be a ""walk in the park"".
Yet he will have to shut out domestic strife in a family once documented in a reality TV series as a tightly-melded unit who ate together and trained together.
Jakob's father Gjert, who used to coach him and his brothers, is under investigation for domestic violence.
Jakob, still only 23, will defend his 1,500m title in Paris after winning at the Covid-delayed Tokyo Olympics, as well as aiming for a distance double in the 5,000m, an event in which he is a two-time world champion.
""If I don't get injured and I don't get sick, I think it's going to be a walk in the park,"" Ingebrigtsen told European Athletics' Ignite podcast.
Despite tasting defeat in the last two world championships 1,500m finals, the Norwegian oozes self-belief.
That was never more on show than in Rome in June where he won his third consecutive European championships double in the 1,500 and 5,000m.
""I never go into a race thinking about the things that I've done before,"" he said.
""Winning is something that I'm always going to chase. It's always a great feeling crossing the finish first, especially in a tight race with great competitors.""
The success in Rome, a perfect tonic for Paris, came after a problematic winter nursing an Achilles tendon injury.
There was also the question of the family conflict that has gripped Norway.
Jakob and his brothers Henrik and Filip -- themselves also European 1500m champions in 2012 and 2016 respectively -- broke off relations with their father Gjert in 2022.
In claims that shocked Norway last October, the trio accused their father of being violent.
""We grew up with a very aggressive and authoritarian father, who used physical violence and threats as part of his upbringing,"" the brothers wrote in an op-ed for newspaper VG.
""We still feel a sense of discomfort and fear that we have felt since childhood.""
Police opened a probe into the abuse claims and prosecutors decided to charge Gjert, 58, with domestic violence against one of his children.
According to a source close to the case, the acts in question do not concern the trio of known athletes but another, younger child.
Over a period of four years, from 2018 to 2022, Gjert allegedly manhandled, insulted, threatened and hit the child in the face with his hand or with a towel.
So came to an end of ""Team Ingebrigtsen"", the name of the fly-on-the-wall documentary series that followed the lives of the family between 2016-20.
The show revealed Gjert as a father who made his sons run up to 170 kilometres a week and forbade Filip from going on holiday with his girlfriend.
""I don't want to be an angry man. I want to be a dad,"" Gjert tells the camera.
""But if we need an angry man to help them realise their dreams, I am ready to be that.""
At what price? When Jakob married last September, Gjert was not invited to the ceremony.
The fall-out rekindles memories of parents who coached their children and were then often portrayed as violent or abusive, from Mary Pierce to Tiger Woods and not forgetting the Williams sisters.
After breaking with his sons, Gjert Ingebrigtsen shocked Norwegian athletics by becoming the trainer of another runner, Narve Gilje Nordas.
The Norwegian Olympic Committee has said Gjert will not be granted accreditation for the Paris Olympics, as was the case at last year's world championships.
As for Jakob, he continues to train alongside his brothers in what he called a ""unique"" set-up.
""The three of us, we're all responsible for our own training. You can say we're training ourselves. At the same time we're coaching each other,"" Ingebrigtsen said.
""It's more of a safety net that's quite big with the experience that's as good as it's ever going to get.""

https://www.citizen.digital/business/tesla-cars-for-first-time-on-chinese-government-purchase-list-n345238,"Tesla cars for first time on Chinese government purchase list
Tesla's best-selling Model Y was included in a list of electric and plug-in hybrid models that a local government in China can purchase as a service car, according to the official Chinese media outlet the Paper on Thursday.
It was the first time Tesla's cars have been made eligible for government purchases in China, the Paper added.
China's eastern Jiangsu provincial government published 56 batches of new energy vehicle procurements for use as service cars by party, government and public organisations in a government statement on June 6.
Apart from the Model Y made in Tesla's Shanghai factory and Volvo Cars' XC40, the other 54 batches were all Chinese-branded EVs and hybrids. Volvo Cars is owned by Chinese automaker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group.
Neither the government nor the Chinese media specified the number of Model Y cars that the Jiangsu provincial government could buy.
Tesla's cars were banned from entering some government and military compounds in China.
The restrictions were removed after it won an endorsement from the country's top auto industry association that said in April the data collection by Tesla fleets in China was compliant.
As demand for Chinese cars abroad is overshadowed by the prospect of tariffs and domestic competition intensifies, Tesla's deliveries of China-made vehicles fell 9% in the first half compared to the same time in 2023.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk's trip to China in late April to meet Premier Li Qiang, however, appears to have paid off.
China has increased its support for Tesla, which plans to build a data training centre and roll out its Full Self Driving software in the country this year, despite ongoing tensions with the United States over tech rivalry.

In Mombasa County, one family discovered the body of their kin at the Coast General Hospital Morgue.
Joash Ombati was allegedly shot by police during last week’s protests in Mombasa.
In Eldoret, another fatality lies at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital Morgue.
The 17-year-old Gredo Oyaro, was shot in the head by police during this week’s anti-government protest in Eldoret town.
This disturbing and shocking video, recorded moments after police fired a live bullet that struck 17-year-old Oyaro, shows a crowd racing against time to save the young boy’s life.
Unfortunately, Oyaro later succumbed to his injuries while doctors at moi teaching and referral hospital tried to save him.
“Niliambiwa mjukuu wako ameshootiwa na akapelekwa hospitalini..kufika huko nilipata ameaga,” Beatrice Akinyi the aunt to Gred said.
Kennedy Otieno, his uncle added: “Niliambiwa nephew wako amepigwa risasi…naskia uchungu sana unaona alikuwa kijana mdogo sana.”
As his body lies at the morgue, Oyaro’s distraught family, are seeking justice for his killing.
They are also appealing to well-wishers to help raise money to cover medical and mortuary bills.
In Mombasa, another family is crying for justice after their son was allegedly shot dead by police during last Tuesdays’ anti-finance bill protests.
The 36-year-old Joash Ombati is said to have died from severe bullet injuries. His family discovered his body on Saturday at the Coast General Hospital mortuary, days after he went missing.
""Tunaomba haki kwa sababu mwanangu hakuwa mwizi alikuwa tu mpita njia,"" Joash's father Jackson Ombati.
Human rights groups report that the number of victims of police brutality could be higher, as more unidentified bodies lie in morgues.
“Kuna mwili mwingine bado kutambuliwa,..we are calling for accountability na wale wote waliohusika na vifo wachukuliwe hatua za kisheria,” Mathias Shipeta stated.
In Bomet County, Francis Memusi, a bodaboda operator, is receiving treatment at Tenwek hospital for a head injury sustained during protests in narok town. The 22-year-old was injured in ensuing melee after police fired into the air to disperse rioters.
""Mtoto wangu alikuwa katika pilkapilka zake..maandamano ilianza na amani,"" Milicent Naipanoi, Memusi's mother said.
Hildah naisiae, Memusi’s aunt added: ""Amekuwa ICU hadi saa hii bill nayo inaongezeka kila dakika tunaomba msaada .""
As these families and many others continue their wait for justice, police officers remain under scrutiny for their role in claiming the lives of kenyans whose only crime was exercising their democratic right under article 37 of kenya’s constitution.

Kenyan protesters broke through parliament barricades on Tuesday and entered the complex, where lawmakers were debating contentious tax hike proposals that have sparked widespread outrage.
According to Amnesty International Kenya, hundreds of protesters broke through police barriers outside parliament in Nairobi, with police firing live rounds and injuring ""many"" people.
A section of parliament that houses offices was also set on fire as protesters stormed the buildings, accompanied by heavy gunfire from police officers battling the defiant mob.
Several protesters according to journalists reporting from the scene had been shot fatally outside the parliament buildings.
The exact number of those shot dead was not immediately ascertained.
Protesters who have rallied against the contentious Bill, which was passed by the House on Tuesday, have been picketing for the past week, arguing that if passed, the Bill will burden an already burdened population.

The court noted that applicants have not made a case to warrant the issuance of conservatory orders.
The application were dismissed for want of merit and prioritized.
On May 15, Chief Justice Martha Koome appointed the three-judge bench composed of Lady Justice Olga Sewe, Justice John Chigiti and Lady Justice Josephine Mongare to determine the case challenging the affordable housing levy.
Five petitioners led by Dr Magare Gikenyi Benjamin had moved to court seeking conservatory orders stopping the implementation of the Affordable Housing Act which was signed into law by President William Ruto in March this year.
The other petitioners were; Pauline Kinyanjui, Philemon Nyakundi, Shallum Nyakundi and Jamlick Orina, who identified themselves as Nakuru residents and opposed the law on grounds that it attempts to introduce ""communist ideologies.""
“The Affordable Housing Act 2024, essentially tries to introduce communist ideologies yet, there is nowhere in the Constitution which allows the government to introduce communist ideologies. Kenya is not a communist state and the constitution does not envisage it,” the petitioners submitted.
They further argued that the national government had taken over the housing function from county governments and that the law introduced “a shadowy entity, the ‘collector’ which collects funds,” instead of the Kenya Revenue Authority.

France coach Didier Deschamps praised his team after Monday's 1-0 win over Belgium which took them into the quarter-finals of Euro 2024 and insisted their ongoing success was not something that should be taken for granted.
The 2022 World Cup runners-up edged their neighbours thanks to a late Jan Vertonghen own goal in Duesseldorf, after a last-16 tie which they dominated without converting the many chances which had fallen their way.
""We have been playing against teams who are used to having more possession but we have made lots of progress in that regard and our opponents are more wary of us now,"" Deschamps said after a defensive Belgium side set up to try to frustrate France.
""Belgium looked quite attacking on paper in their set-up today but they were prudent in the way they played.
""We did everything today to attack and create chances. We also needed to be intelligent and wary, to not give them the spaces they wanted.
""It is not what wins you the match but it is better to have the ball and make your opponents defend. We didn't fall into their trap, we did what we had to do.""
France had 20 attempts on goal to just six for Belgium, but their finishing again let them down and they have reached the last eight despite none of their players having scored in open play.
Of the three goals they have netted in four games at the tournament, one was a penalty by Kylian Mbappe against Poland while the other two were scored by opposition defenders.
""The only thing was the number of shots we had which were off target, but we are so proud to once again be in the quarter-finals.
""We are expected to get there but we must appreciate it and not think it will happen every time,"" said Deschamps.
This is his sixth major tournament as coach, and France have now reached at least the quarter-finals five times.
The one exception was at the last Euros three years ago, when they went out in the last 16 on penalties to Switzerland.
France now go to Hamburg for a quarter-final on Friday after a victory which Deschamps celebrated in demonstrative fashion at full-time.
""This is the highest level and it was a very tight game. I understand how cruel it is for (Belgium coach) Domenico Tedesco but when you win you want to show joy,"" he said.
""You need to appreciate every moment. We are not going to get carried away but we are in the quarter-finals and obviously that was important for us.""

Published on: July 02, 2024 07:31 (EAT)
Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani was disbarred on Tuesday for repeatedly making false statements about the 2020 presidential election lost by Donald Trump.
The sanction of the 80-year-old Giuliani, who spearheaded Trump's legal efforts to overturn his election defeat, was handed down by a state appeals court in New York.
Giuliani ""repeatedly and intentionally made false statements ... concerning the 2020 Presidential election, in which he baselessly attacked and undermined the integrity of this country's electoral process,"" the court said.
""In so doing, respondent not only deliberately violated some of the most fundamental tenets of the legal profession, but he also actively contributed to the national strife that has followed the 2020 Presidential election, for which he is entirely unrepentant.""
Giuliani filed for bankruptcy in December after being ordered by a jury to pay $148 million in damages for defaming two Georgia poll workers with false claims they engaged in election fraud.
The former New York mayor has also been indicted on racketeering charges in Georgia along with Trump and others for allegedly conspiring to overturn the 2020 election results in the southern state.
He also faces election-related charges in Arizona.
Giuliani was New York mayor from 1994 to 2001, guiding the city through the shock of the September 11 attacks and becoming known as ""America's Mayor"" -- before signing up as Trump's personal lawyer while he was in the White House.
Giuliani's license to practice law has already been suspended in New York and in Washington for ""false and misleading statements"" he made as part of his efforts to overturn the results of the election won by Joe Biden.
Hunter Biden, Joe Biden's son, has also filed a lawsuit against Giuliani accusing him of computer fraud for accessing personal data on his computer.
In 2020, in a bid to embarrass Biden ahead of the election, Giuliani and Trump allies circulated data from a laptop that Hunter Biden had abandoned at a computer repair shop in Delaware.

The three remaining victims who are in stable condition continue to receive medication at the facility.
During the protests, Police were engaged in a cat-and-mouse battle with youth who were protesting in Homa Bay town.
The demonstrations began in the morning, leading to a confrontation with police.
The confrontation led to a situation in which the youth pelted stones at the police while the police retaliated with tear gas.
Police were repulsing the youth from accessing the central business district of Homa Bay town.
Business persons incurred serious losses after their activities were paralysed. All business premises were closed down as traders feared looting during the demonstrations.
The youth also blocked roads in the town, paralysing transport services in the area.

Three people lost their lives following last
week's anti-government protests on Tuesday when a group of hired goons attacked
Sunbeam Mall on Nairobi’s Mfangano Street.
The
assailants looted and torched the commercial building, resulting in the deaths
of three businesspersons.
Among
the victims was Bernard Mungai, who tragically fell from the third floor while
trying to escape the raging fire.
His
grieving family has expressed their deep anguish over the devastating
loss.
Mungai
was inside his shoe store on the ground floor when suddenly, the goons broke
in, started looting, and then torched the building.
As
the mall was looted and torched, Mungai tried to flee upstairs for safety, but
tragically fell and sustained serious injuries.
Terrifying
video footage seen by Citizen TV captured Mungai hanging from the third floor
before falling as tried to save his life.
“Alianguka
akijaribu kukimbia… nilipigiwa simu,” said Joyce Nyambura, Mungai's wife.
The
deceased’s son, Harrison Mungai added, “Tulikuwa naye, akaniambia niendange juu
teargas ilikuwa imeanza kupigwa.”
Efforts
to save him were not successful at St. Francis Hospital in Nairobi's Kasarani
area, where he was rushed in critical condition.
“Wakati
walikuwa wanampeleka thearte alikuwa haongei; baadaye nilipigiwa simu kuambiwa
ameenda,” said Nyambura.
Mungai's
death has dealt a big blow to his family, who depended on him for
provision.
“Sina
mbele wala nyuma,” lamented Nyambura.
Her
daughter Wairimu, added, “Last kuongea na babangu ilikuwa date 14th...sijaamini.”
To
add to the woes this family faces, St. Francis Hospital has insisted it will
not release the body for burial until a postmortem examination is conducted.
“Tulikuwa
tumtoe lakini St Francis hawawezi wakaachilia walisema mwili ni yao lazima
wafanye postmortem,” Nyambura noted.
The
hospital said it is following standard procedures, especially for those who
were taken there for treatment related to the protests.
Apart
from Mungai, two other people died at Sunbeam, including Mathew Njoroge, whose
charred body was discovered a week later after the building was burnt
down.
Other
business operators sustained injuries while trying to flee to safety.

This follows a post on KMPDU's X account on Monday, announcing the suspension of plans to occupy the Ministry of Health's premises at Afya House in Nairobi.
KMPDU had announced plans to occupy the premises on Monday, July 8, to ensure that all medical interns are posted to health facilities nationwide in line with the 2017 Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).
The announcement said that the suspension was prompted by ongoing discussions to ensure that the CBA agreement is met.
In his swift rebuttal, Atellah termed the reports as false and that the account had been compromised, adding that the strike is still on.
""The union handle has been compromised and we are trying our best to gain control of it and clean. We must overhaul the system including those that have hacked the union handles. We remain strong. We remain focused. Tukutane MoH,"" he wrote on X.

Vincent Chepkwony, the security guard who
went viral for allowing protesters to take refuge inside the Java House outlet on
Kimathi Street during the height of the anti-government demonstrations in
Nairobi, has been commended for his dedication and service in the private
security industry.
Private Security Regulatory Authority (PSRA)
CEO Fazul Mahamed made the announcement in a letter addressed to Chepkwony on
Tuesday, highlighting that his efforts had earned him appreciation from the
private security watchdog.
""Pursuant to Section 9 (II of the
Private Security Regulation Act, this Letter of Appreciation is awarded to Mr.
Vincent Chepkwony. The commendation is in recognition of your remarkable
dedication and service in the Private Security Industry in the country,""
said Mahamed.
""Your unwavering commitment, exceptional
professionalism, and strict compliance with the legal standards have been
instrumental in promoting the development of the private security industry in
Kenya.""
The PSRA boss, in a separate press release,
indicated that the authority had convened a meeting with Chepkwony and his direct
employer, Hatari Security, following reports that he had been fired over the
incident.
“After a comprehensive review, the Authority
firmly concluded that Mr. Chepkwony's actions were heroic, patriotic and
commendable and therefore warranted a promotion and not a dismissal from duty,”
said Mahamed.
“Consequently, the Authority directed Hatari
Security Limited to reinstate Mr. Vincent Chepkwony to his role as a security
guard with immediate effect.”
He added: “Mr. Chepkwony has subsequently
been awarded the highest commendation and recognition for a Private Security
Officer in Kenya for his bravery and unwavering commitment to duty. His
reinstatement stands as a testament to the core values that uphold the private
security industry in Kenya.”
This comes just hours after Hatari Security had
denied reports of axing Chepkwony from its payroll.
Citizen Digital spoke to Elisha Kirui, a
controller from the company, who said: ""No, it is not true that Vincent
has been fired, and he has not been moved to another place. He has been absent
since 25th June, yesterday he came and we tried to reinstate him but he decided
to leave.”
“We tried looking for him yesterday but he is
the one who decided to leave he has not been fired here,” he added.

Through her X account, CS Nakhumicha noted that 294 victims have been treated with a majority having been discharged without digging into their pockets.
""235 have been treated for various degrees of injuries and discharged and none has been asked for payment. 58 are still admitted with 1 in ICU, 3 waiting for theatre,"" she wrote.
Nakhumicha further acknowledged the ongoing funds drive which has seen members of the public contributing money to cater for those affected during the protests.
""My attention has been drawn to efforts by some individuals to raise funds from the public to pay hospital bills for persons injured during the demonstrations,"" added Nakhumicha.
This comes on the backdrop of a fund drive made through an online and mobile fundraising platform, M-Changa which has been pioneered by some of the prominent voices behind the protests among them activist Hanifa Adan.
""What you do is text me on WhatsApp with the invoices, and the hospital bank account details. M-Changa only works with bank account details and also send the document stating the injuries,"" said Hanifa in one of her updates.
""For burial, you just send me the postmortem and the burial permit. And for burial expenses, I only speak to the parents and family members. Mind you I verify and I am not the one with the money it is with M-Changa.""
She however cited that some Kenyans are taking advantage of the noble initiative and have been sending doctored documents to access free money, prompting the need for proof.
""Money is sent directly to the hospital if there is any con game involved with the hospital I will drag that hospital down myself wallah,"" she said.
""I’m putting this out there, and I’m even warning, if any hospital tries to take advantage of this and forge invoices and documents, I will get very personal with your hospital I promise. Just try and if you do please don’t let me find out.""
National rights watchdog Kenya National Commission on Human Rights said that as of Monday a total of 39 people have been killed in anti-government demonstrations in Kenya.
It also said there had been 32 cases of ""enforced or involuntary disappearances"" and 627 arrests of protesters.

The hearing of the case in which Tana River
Senator Danson Mungatana and 17 others are accused of defrauding the Kilifi County
Government of Ksh.51 million commenced in a Malindi court on Wednesday.
A former Integrated Financial Management
Information System (IFMIS) liaison officer with the county government, Gabriel
Mkare, testified that six companies linked to the lawmaker fraudulently
siphoned funds from the county's accounts at the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK).
Mkare told Malindi Chief Magistrate Elizabeth
Usui that the fraud came to light when an invoice to pay temporary county
employees on strike was rejected by IFMIS due to insufficient funds in the
designated account.
According to Mkare, the IFMIS rejection
raised suspicion and triggered an investigation revealing transactions that
hadn't undergone proper validation and approval processes.
He further stated that the companies which
received payments were unfamiliar to the county government, as they had
bypassed the identification, validation, procurement, and approval procedures.
By the time this discrepancy was discovered,
Mkare noted, some of the recipients had already withdrawn the funds deposited
into their accounts.
Mkare further took the court through the
county's step-by-step payment system, highlighting numerous irregularities in
the approval of fraudulent transactions.
For instance, Daima One Enterprises received
Ksh.7,230,940 from the Kilifi County government, with an attempted second
transaction of Ksh.4,100,200 halted by the Central Bank before it was
withdrawn.
Leadership Edge Associates and Kilingi
Investments Company also received Ksh.7,840,910 and Ksh.6,700,952 respectively,
with a subsequent transaction of Ksh.3,109,132 to the former halted.
Zohali Services Limited, Mkare went on,
withdrew Ksh.5,390,520 from the county government's CBK account and withdrew
Ksh.125,125 from it, leaving a balance of Ksh.7,715,000, which was reimbursed
to Kilifi County.
Makega Suppliers Limited conducted two
transactions amounting to Ksh.3,243,958 and Ksh.7,119,220. They managed to
withdraw Ksh.3,063,057 and Ksh.6,785,951.20 respectively, leaving a remaining
balance of Ksh.623,787.60.
Furthermore, Mkare added, Jahazi Investments
Company Limited received Ksh.6,012,950, withdrawing all but Ksh.180,548.80.
Mungatana was dramatically arrested by Ethics
and Anti-Corruption (EACC) officers alongside six other people, among them four
Kilifi County government officials and two business people, on Thursday April
11, 2019, while the other 11 were arrested later.
The case has been ongoing for the past five
years as the prosecution sought witnesses, which they have now secured.
The trial is anticipated to proceed without
interruption until all witnesses have provided their testimony.

Kenya National Women’s Basketball Premier
League defending champions Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) head coach Anthony
Ojukwu is optimistic of defeating Strathmore Swords, when they host the
students in Mombasa for the remaining games of the semi-final playoffs.
KPA, who have one foot in the final, only need
to win one game out of their remaining three to qualify for the final, with
game three set for Saturday at the Makande Gymnasium, Mombasa.
The Dockers won Game One and Two 63-48 and
61-54 respectively in Nairobi, and will be banking on their experience to
qualify despite injury scare.
“Preparations are going on well, we have some
injuries; Linda Alando, Grace Irebu and Belinda Akoth who haven’t trained after
suffering injuries in Nairobi, but they are recovering well. We are fine at the
camp only that the demonstrations going on in the country have affected us a
little bit but we are ready and focused for the games,” said Ojukwu.
“Strathmore is a good team, they play well,
they push us hard but for us it is all about preparations, planning and game
plan and wait for the result which I believe will favor us,” he added.
Elsewhere, Equity Hawks head coach Benson
Oluoch believes they have all it takes to win the semi-final series match against
Zetech Sparks, despite the wave of protests in the country affecting their
training.
The two sides are tied at 1-1 in the
series and each team is looking forward to winning two of the remaining
three matches to qualify for the final.
They will play the remaining games at Nyayo
Gymnasium starting Friday, July 5-8, 2024.
In game one, Zetech Sparks won 62-50 before
Equity turned around the tables to win game two 69-59.
“With the on-going Gen Z protests we really
couldn’t do that much, but with the time we had to prepare. I believe we have
done what we could do so we just go out and give our best shot. We would
have loved to prepare better and have more time. but since that is not the
case we shall just go out and give the best that we can,” noted Oluoch.

Evans Odhiambo Absalom claimed gold in the Heavyweight category, while Emmanuel Yakavi triumphed in the Lightweight category. Mary Atieno, President of the Kenyan paraboxing team, attributed their success to the support from well-wishers.
""We are delighted to have represented Kenya internationally and to have achieved second place with two gold medals,"" she emphasized.
Overall, the team was recognized for their discipline and received a trophy for it. Earlier in March, the team received crucial support from former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko, who provided funding for visas, competition uniforms, accommodation, and training equipment including gloves, punching bags, and wheelchairs.
""Sonko's intervention was crucial; it enabled us to train effectively with the equipment purchased. Additionally, the Sports Ministry assisted by arranging local accommodation,"" Mary confirmed.
In the competition, Poland secured first place, followed by Kenya in second and Portugal in third among the six competing teams. The team returned home yesterday.

Osoro took to social media on Sunday where he shared a clip of him interacting with locals in South Mugirango, where he bought them mahindi choma.
One of the residents who was passing by asked the MP if anyone had had an issue with him over his support for the punitive bill, to which Osoro said he is okay.
""Has anyone messed you up so far?"" the resident asked.
""Here I'm okay. No one can dare do that to me,"" Osoro responded.
In another video clip, the National Assembly Chief Whip is seen interacting with youths from his constituency, discussing recent protests and the finance bill.
Osoro asks the youth, most of them Gen Z, if they are planning to attack him and other leaders who supported the bill.
The MP jokes that Gen Z are now ruling the country, to which the youth laugh and promise to be peaceful and protect people's property.
Osoro and over 200 MPS irked Kenyans when they voted in favour of the bill, which led to invasion of Parliament by angry protesters.
The protests turned ugly, leading to the killing of 41 people by the police.
President William Ruto rejected the bill in totality, saying his government will be compelled to take austerity measures to finance its spending.
Kenyans have accused the Ruto administration of punitive taxation and corruption, something the President says he is willing to work on.

Kenya School of Law (KSL) Student Governing
Council President Joshua Okayo, who was reportedly abducted by police last
Wednesday during the peak of the anti-Finance Bill demonstrations, has been
found near Margua River in Murang'a County.
Okayo, whom reports indicate appeared to have
been tortured, is currently recuperating at Avenue Hospital in Thika under
close observation due to the psychological trauma of the ordeal.
Law Society of Kenya (LSK) President Faith
Odhiambo has since confirmed Okayo's rescue and that of Regis Wanjala, another
student who also went missing on the same day.
""We have confirmation that two comrades
have been dumped at unknown locations after their abductions. Joshua Okayo was
dumped somewhere in Murang’a after being abducted in Rongai on Wednesday,""
Ms. Odhiambo said in a statement on X on Friday.
""Regis Wanjala who was abducted on the
same day was also found dumped in a tea plantation in Ruiru. The two are safe
but currently receiving medical attention and are still shaken up from the
ordeal. We shall find recourse for these unfortunate actions of police. Justice
be our shield and defender.""
Ms. Odhiambo has been vocal in condemning the
reported police abductions, drawing parallels to the authoritarian era of the
late former President Daniel Moi.
""This is shocking! I feel like we are
going back to the Moi era; the last we heard of abductions and torture
chambers. Our country is singing about and in the region people are praising
Kenyans such abductions coming back. Some of the abducted persons have been
released but others remain unaccounted for,"" she said on Citizen TV's
JKLive Show last week.
She subsequently called for the immediate
release of protesters in detention and urged accountability from law
enforcement authorities.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/storm-beryl-shifts-toward-houston-could-make-landfall-as-category-2-hurricane-n345410,"Storm Beryl shifts toward Houston, could make landfall as Category 2 hurricane
The storm was expected to strengthen into a Category 1 hurricane on Sunday as it travels over warm waters. The NHC issued hurricane warnings across much of the Texas coast.
Forecasters warned that Beryl could bring punishing winds and 5 to 10 inches (13 to 25 centimeters) of rain to the Texas coast and beyond.
Coastal areas were already seeing waters rise on Sunday and county officials ordered one beach town evacuated. The U.S. Coast Guard shut the port of Houston on Sunday afternoon due to worsening sea conditions. It also closed the ports of Texas City, Freeport and Galveston in Texas.
School systems including Houston's - the state's largest - said they would be closed Monday.
National Hurricane Center Director Michael Brennan warned on Sunday afternoon that residents had only a few more hours to prepare. ""If you have been asked to leave by local officials, please do so,"" he said.
Acting Texas Governor Dan Patrick said Beryl ""will be a deadly storm for people who are directly in that path."" He declared 120 counties to be in a disaster area.
The storm has prompted closures or vessel traffic restrictions at multiple ports in cities from Houston to Corpus Christi, which is the top crude oil export hub in the U.S. The closures could disrupt crude oil exports, shipments of crude to refineries, and motor fuel from these plants.
Temperatures in the region are forecast at above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) in the coming days, including heat indices as high as 108 on Sunday. Parts of eastern Texas were on flood watch ahead of the storm, which had maximum wind speeds of 60 mph (96 kph) as of Sunday morning.
Earlier this week the storm, which at one point intensified into the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record, left a deadly trail of destruction across the Caribbean. It swept through Jamaica, Grenada, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, in addition to unleashing heavy rainfall on northern Venezuela.
It has claimed at least 11 lives, tearing apart buildings while felling power lines and trees.
Beryl last made landfall on Friday, crossing Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula and causing power outages in some areas. It largely spared the top beach destinations there and caused no casualties. Video showed the international airport at Cancun packed with tourists on Saturday as they rescheduled flights home after the storm.
With Beryl now approaching Texas, the National Weather Service warned of storm surges causing coastal flooding and rip currents.
OIL REFINERIES
Most of the northern Gulf's offshore oil and gas production is east of Beryl's forecast track.
Some oil producers, including Shell (SHEL.L) and Chevron (CVX.N) had evacuated personnel from their Gulf of Mexico offshore production platforms ahead of the storm.
Citgo Petroleum Corp said it plans to keep the Corpus Christi refinery running at minimum production as the storm moves up the coast.
Gibson Energy (GEI.TO), which operates a large oil terminal in Corpus Christi, said operations were continuing, but it would take further steps depending on the forecast.

Published on: July 08, 2024 01:12 (EAT)
Mathira MP Eric Wamumbi has confirmed that he has fallen out with his once close ally Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua.
Wamumbi said on Sunday that it's true he is not seeing eye-to-eye with Gachagua, but denied their fallout is a result of the closure of bars within Nyeri county.
""It is true. There is a Rift between the Deputy president and I. The rift is not about the closed bars in Karatina town which have left the town dead for four months,"" Wamumbi said.
The MP went on to claim that there is something bigger that has led to their fallout, and Gachagua should come out and speak the truth.
""It is about something bigger than that, he should say the truth, and nothing but the truth. I will be telling the truth, and the people of Mathira will pick which side to believe in,"" Wamumbi added.
His sentiments come a day after Gachagua faulted some leaders, including the Ministry of Interior, for fighting his initiative of ending the illicit brew menace in the Mt. Kenya region.
Gachagua said those opposing the fight are tainting President Ruto's legacy, especially after the fight against illicit had picked momentum.
Gachagua played a pivotal role in Wamumbi's election as Mathira MP in 2022 as he was set to replace him when he was picked by Ruto as his running mate.
The DP went on to urge the people of Mathira to elect Wamumbi, who had previously served as a Member of the County Assembly in Nyeri.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/im-here-for-you-charlene-ruto-promises-her-support-to-kenyan-youth-attracts-criticism-n345197,"'I'm here for you!' Charlene Ruto promises her support to Kenyan youth, attracts criticism
Ruto, who has been making her views clear intermittently over the last few weeks, on Wednesday, July 3 gathered a team of '47 presidents' from 47 County student associations, where she addressed several issues touching on the youth while also promising action.
Flanked by the youthful leaders, Ruto spoke to the media and to Kenyans at large, promising the youth that she had 'heard their voices'.
""I hear your voices. I understand your concerns. The challenges we face as a generation are real and pressing. From unemployment to the rising cost of living, we are all feeling the impact of our current economic situation,"" she said.
""I want you to know, that your engagement in our nation's affairs is not just welcome, but essential. They all contribute to the vibrant democracy we are building together.""
On X, Ruto went on to encourage the youth to continue in their constructive participation in the country's affairs, promising Kenyans that she was ready to 'listen, learn and work' alongside them.
""This is indeed what I encourage - constructive engagement. Let's be the generation that's known not just for its passion, but for its innovation in governance and civic participation. I am here to listen, learn and work alongside you. I am here for you,"" she said.
Charlene's message was, however, met with some derision and ridicule from a section of Kenyans who wondered what authority was she speaking with many also saying that they were interested in what her father had to say - and not her.
Some rubbished her comments as merely cosmetic speak, seeing that she doesn't hold any official position in the government and had no power to effect any meaningful change beyond the rosy commentary.
Veteran disc jockey DJ Krowbar wrote, ""Completely insensitive, out of pulse with where the country is. Secondly, you are not a government employee to address Kenyans. You are the president's daughter who is looking for clout.""
Someone else said, ""We never saw Ngina Kenyatta speak this much for the entire 10-year presidency. 'I hear you'... But as who? We were not addressing our concerns to you. We are dealing with your father. Sit back!""
Popular content creator Dennis Ombachi chimed in too, saying, ""Hatuja kataa wewe ni blood ambassador. Ambassador of the blood shed by the youth murdered by this GOVT. That’s what you represent, speak up for them or forever hold your peace. Na siongelei nywele.""
Also displeased was media personality Adelle Onyango. She said: ""Things don't go wrong, they START wrong. The beginning here was @charlruto appointing herself the leader of the youth. Even attempting to introduce the ""office of the first daughter"". Gen Z have already tabled their demands to your father. Stop this.""
Out of all of the President's children, Charlene has been the most active and visible, regularly hosting events, appearing at youth summits, initiating programs and commenting on thorny national issues.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/explainer-how-democrats-could-replace-biden-as-presidential-candidate-before-november-n344892,"Explainer: How Democrats could replace Biden as presidential candidate before November
After President Joe Biden's shaky performance at the debate with former President Donald Trump on Thursday night, some Democrats openly questioned whether he should be replaced as their candidate for the 2024 election.
For answers on how that would work, Reuters spoke to Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank, a Democratic National Committee (DNC) member, and author of the book ""Primary Politics"" about the presidential nominating process.
Q: WHAT OPTIONS DO
DEMOCRATS HAVE?
A: The Democratic Party has had no real Plan B for Biden as its presidential candidate. He ran virtually unopposed for the party's presidential nomination this year.
He will not be nominated officially until later this summer, so there is still time to make a change and a handful of scenarios to enact one: Biden could decide himself to step aside before he is nominated; he could be challenged by others who try to win over the delegates he has accrued; or he could withdraw after the Democratic convention in Chicago in August, leaving the Democratic National Committee to elect someone to run against Trump in his place.
Q: SO WHAT HAPPENS
NEXT?
A: Right now, the process largely depends on Biden. He would have to agree to step down or face a challenger this late in the process who would try to force him to do so. So far Biden has shown no indications of wanting to step aside and no opponents have challenged him directly.
In fact some of his top potential replacements - Vice President Kamala Harris and California Governor Gavin Newsom - spoke passionately in his defense after the debate, serving in a surrogate role that showcased their support but also contrasted their smooth delivery with his faltering one on the Atlanta debate stage.
Q: WHAT HAPPENS IF
BIDEN STEPS DOWN?
A: Biden has spent the last several months accruing nearly 4,000 Democratic delegates by winning primary elections in U.S. states and territories.
Those delegates would normally vote for him, but the rules do not bind or force them to do so; delegates can vote with their conscience, which means they could throw their vote to someone else.
If Biden ""releases"" his delegates by stepping aside, there could be a competition among other Democratic candidates to become the nominee.
Q: WHO WOULD REPLACE
BIDEN?
A: Several candidates could step into the fray, but there is no obvious number one.
Vice President Harris would almost certainly be at the top of the list, but she has had her own problems after a rocky start in the job and poor polling, opens new tab numbers. The U.S. Constitution dictates that the vice president becomes president if the president dies or becomes incapacitated, but it does not weigh in on an inter-party process for choosing a nominee.
California Governor Newsom, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker have all been floated as possible replacements, but they are Biden supporters and campaign surrogates who are working to help get him elected now.
Q: HOW WOULD A
NOMINEE BE CHOSEN?
A: There would likely be a free-for-all of sorts between the Democratic heavyweights vying for the job.
Candidates would have to get signatures from 600 convention delegates to be nominated. There are expected to be some 4,672 delegates in 2024, including 3,933 pledged delegates and 739 automatic or superdelegates, according to Ballotpedia, opens new tab.
If no one gets a majority of the delegates, then there would be a ""brokered convention"" in which the delegates act as free agents and negotiate with the party leadership to come up with a nominee.
Rules would be established and there would be roll call votes for the names placed into nomination.
It could take several rounds of voting for someone to get a majority and become the nominee. The last brokered convention when Democrats failed to nominate a candidate on the first ballot was in 1952.
Q: WHAT HAPPENS IF
BIDEN STEPS DOWN AFTER THE CONVENTION?
A: If Biden steps down after the August convention, the 435 members of the Democratic National Committee would choose a new candidate. The members would meet in a special session to select a nominee.
Q: WHO ARE THESE 435
DNC MEMBERS?
A: They are divided equally between men and women as well as various constituency groups including labor leaders, LGBTQ representatives, and racial minorities. Of the total, 75 are appointed at-large by the chair, while the rest are elected in their respective states.
Q: WHO COULD NOMINATE
AN ALTERNATIVE IN THAT CASE?
A: To nominate a candidate to replace Biden on the ballot, that person would have to have the support of a minimum number of DNC members -- perhaps around 60, though the exact number would be determined by the DNC's rules committee, which would lay out the rules for the proceedings before they started.
There would likely be nominating speeches and seconding speeches. Multiple candidates could be nominated before the list is whittled down.
Q: HOW WOULD THOSE
VOTES BE COUNTED?
A: The DNC would likely hold its meeting in Washington and the votes would be counted there. Ballots would be coded, signed and collected by hand. If a vote were to happen very close to Election Day on Nov. 5, when it was not possible to meet in person, then it would likely be virtual.

A military court in the volatile east of DR Congo sentenced 22 soldiers to death on Monday for ""fleeing the enemy"" during fighting with M23 rebels, a lawyer told AFP.
Sixteen soldiers were handed death sentences in one case in the North Kivu province, and six others in a separate case, coming just days after 25 soldiers received a similar judgment.
The latest sentences come as M23 rebels, which Kinshasha accuses Rwanda of backing, last week seized new terrain on the northern front of the conflict that has been ongoing for two-and-a-half years in the North Kivu province.
A military court condemned 16 people in one case in the court in North Kivu.
The prosecution had asked on Saturday that 22 people in the case be condemned to death.
But the court on Monday instead handed down 10-year prison sentences to three defendants and acquitted three other people.
In a separate case examined and judged on Monday in North Kivu six of the seven defendants were sentenced to death and one person was acquitted, lawyer Jules Muvweko told AFP.
Last Wednesday, a court sentenced 25 soldiers to death during a one day trial for also 'fleeing the enemy', lawyers said.
Since the end of 2021, the M23 rebels have conquered vast swathes of territory in the province, nearly completely encircling the provincial capital of Goma.

The duo are said to have killed Martin Makori in cold blood on the fateful night.
The prosecution informed the court that a mental assessment conducted against the accused persons found that they were fit to face trial.
Kiptoo’s lawyer Joseph Kiplagat requested for his client to be released on reasonable bail saying that he was a medical student and eager to continue with his studies.
On his part, the first accused pleaded with the Judge to free him on reasonable bail terms saying that he has two children who had cleared their form four studies and were due to join universities in September.
The accused have been remanded at Eldoret GK prison since their arrest in April.
Justice Wananda directed the prosecution to supply the accused persons through their defense lawyers with copies of witness statements.
He further ordered the prosecution to avail pre-bail report in two weeks, when the application by the accused persons to be freed on bond will be heard.
Justice Wananda set mention of the case on July 29, 2024.

https://www.citizen.digital/opinion-blogs/opinion-we-the-people-the-power-and-necessity-of-effective-public-participation-n345310,"OPINION: “We the People” - The power and necessity of effective public participation
The preamble to the
Constitution of Kenya 2010 starts with the empowering words, “We the People.”
Article 1 of this document enshrines the principle that all sovereign power
belongs to the people of Kenya.
This is not just a
statement, it is a foundational element of governance that asserts the
necessity for genuine public participation in all matters of national
importance. The recent protests by the youth against the Finance Bill serve as
a reminder of this principle and the critical need for the government to listen
and respond to its citizens.
Public participation is
the foundation of democracy. It allows citizens to voice their concerns,
contribute to decision-making processes, and hold their leaders accountable.
Effective public participation ensures that policies reflect the will and needs
of the people, fostering a more inclusive and equitable society.
The Constitution of
Kenya 2010 places a strong emphasis on public participation, with Article 10
listing it as a national value and principle of governance.
To be effective, public
participation must be more than just a formality. It should involve
proactive engagement with citizens, transparent dissemination of information,
and genuine incorporation of public input into decision-making processes.
This requires
government officials to create accessible platforms for dialogue, solicit
feedback on proposed legislation, and demonstrate a willingness to adapt
policies based on citizen input.
The recent protests
against the Finance Bill show how frustrated many Kenyans, especially the
youth, feel about the lack of genuine public involvement and government action.
The bill, viewed by many as a heavy burden, led to widespread discontent,
prompting young people to protest in the streets.
These protests
highlight the need for the government to listen to its citizens. When people
feel ignored, they often protest to make their voices heard. The government
must offer effective ways for dialogue and be willing to adjust policies based
on public feedback.
Kenya’s legal framework
strongly supports public participation. Besides the Constitution, the Public
Participation Act of 2018 provides guidelines for involving citizens in
decision-making processes.
This Act requires that
public participation be integrated into all levels of government and that
public forums be conducted in an open and transparent manner.
Additionally,
international conventions and treaties signed by Kenya stress the significance
of public participation. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
(ICCPR) and the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights (ACHPR) affirm
citizens right to engage in public affairs.
These agreements
collectively mandate that governance must integrate public participation to
ensure policies and decisions reflect the people's will.
Despite strong legal
frameworks, achieving effective public participation in Kenya faces challenges,
limited awareness, inadequate access to information, and insufficient
mechanisms to incorporate public feedback into policy decisions.
Logistical barriers
like geographical constraints and digital divides also hinder broad
participation, especially among marginalized and rural communities.
The government should
prioritize raising awareness of participation rights, enhancing transparency in
its processes, ensuring information accessibility across different formats and
languages, and expanding digital platforms while effectively bridging the
digital divide.
The principle of “We
the People” enshrined in the Kenyan Constitution must be realized through
active and effective public participation. This requires a paradigm shift in
how public engagement is approached by both the government and citizens.
The government must be
proactive in soliciting and valuing public input, while citizens must be
informed and willing to engage in governance processes.
Recent events
demonstrate that public participation is not merely a procedural formality but
a vital component of a functioning democracy. By ensuring that the voices of
all Kenyans are heard and considered in policy-making, then we can move towards
a more inclusive, equitable, and responsive governance system.
The youth protests
against the Finance Bill are a powerful reminder of the need for continual
engagement and the essential role that public participation plays in the
democratic process.
In conclusion, ""We
the People"" is a call to action for both the government and citizens of
Kenya. To uphold the Constitution, public participation must be embraced as a
fundamental part of democratic governance. Only through genuine and inclusive
participation can Kenya truly reflect the will and aspirations of its people.

St. Anthony's Kitale soccer team popularly
known as ‘Solidarity Boys' have filed an appeal against their opponents, St. Joseph’s
Boys Kitale, in the Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association (KSSSA) Trans
Nzoia County football finals.
St. Anthony’s head coach Peter Mayoyo has dismissed
the result of the match played at Kipkeikei High School grounds, where they
lost 2-0 to their neighbours and arch-rivals St. Joseph’s on Monday afternoon.
Coach Mayoyo told Citizen Digital that they
have already filed their complaints at the County Education Director’s office, with
the case set to be heard on Wednesday, July 10, 2024.
The tactician claims their opponents flouted some
of the rules of the games, including fielding players over the required age of
19.
“Our opponents fielded players who are over-age,
and have several other cases contrary to the KSSSA Constitution, especially on
transfer of players who must be bona fide students who have stayed in their
respective schools for at least 90 days before the start of the preliminaries
at the Sub County level, except for Form One,” said Mayoyo.
Mayoyo claimed he also has evidence of some of
the players having multiple birth certificates, contrary to the rules.
In a statement released on Tuesday, the team noted
that majority of their players are not supposed to participate in the school
games due to various infractions.
“It is disheartening, therefore, to witness
episodes that jeopardize these values. Our recent match against St. Joseph's
Boys Kitale brought to fore significant concerns regarding fair play. It has
come to our attention that an overwhelming majority of their players, 98% to be
precise, have cases to answer the and are not supposed to participate in the
under-19 school games, a violation that cannot be overlooked.”
Mayoyo said they will continue advocating for
fair play in their competitions.
“Accepting such impunity would be a disservice
to not only our team but to the spirit of fair competition that nurtures true
talent and sportsmanship. The incident, while unfortunate, does not deter our
resolve. It reinforces our commitment to fighting for a transparent, just, and
equitable sporting environment. Losing with honour in the shadow of such
adversity is, in itself, a profound honour. It underscores our dedication to
upholding the principles of fair play.”

https://www.citizen.digital/news/kamala-harris-top-choice-to-replace-joe-biden-if-he-steps-aside-sources-say-n345179,"Kamala Harris top choice to replace Joe Biden if he steps aside, sources say
Biden's fumbling, sometimes-incoherent and widely-panned first-debate performance against Republican rival Donald Trump last week set off a wave of panic within the Democratic party over concerns that he may not be fit enough to serve a second term, and prompted calls for top aides to resign.
Some influential Democrats have floated alternatives to Biden besides Harris, including popular cabinet members and Democratic governors like Gavin Newsom from California, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania. But trying to sidestep Harris is wishful thinking and would be nearly impossible, these sources, who did not wish to be named, said.
If named as the party nominee, Harris, 59, would take over money raised by the Biden campaign and inherit campaign infrastructure, the sources said. She also has the highest name recognition among all the alternatives, and the highest polling among Democrats who could seriously be considered a candidate, the sources said.
In a Reuters/Ipsos poll published Tuesday, Harris trailed Trump by one percentage point at 42% to 43%, a difference that was well within the poll's 3.5 percentage point margin of error, a showing statistically just as strong as Biden's.
In addition, she has already been vetted for national office and has survived intense scrutiny from Republicans, they said. Also, U.S. Representative Jim Clyburn, the man who was key to Biden's 2020 win, told MSNBC he would support Harris to be the Democratic nominee if Biden stepped aside.
""It's pretty near impossible to win the nomination over the vice president,"" said Michael Trujillo, a Democratic strategist from California who worked for Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2008 and 2016.
White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Tuesday that Biden just had a ""bad night"" at the debate and would continue to make his case for reelection to the American people. The Biden campaign deferred to Harris's team for comment on the story.
Harris's aides dismissed any talk of a Democratic ticket that doesn't include both Biden and Harris. ""Vice President Harris looks forward to serving a second term with President Joe Biden,"" a statement from her office said.
Biden's campaign has amassed 3,894 delegates after state primaries, leaving only a few dozen ""uncommitted"" delegates outstanding. They are expected to formally nominate Biden later this month in a virtual meeting, ahead of the Democrats' nominating convention in August.
""All of the delegates are not just Joe Biden delegates, they are Kamala Harris delegates,"" Trujillo said, adding ""she will have a sizable delegation and support in all 50 states on day one,"" he said.
Donna Brazile, the former interim chair of the Democratic National Committee, who has a key committee role at this year's Democratic National Convention in August, said the person who can step in right away, if Biden decides not to run, is Harris.
""People may have dreams of another superhero but there is a process and the last time I checked it's a Biden-Harris ticket, she's number two on the ticket,"" Brazile said, adding Biden remains the nominee for the Democratic party and ""is not going anywhere.""
Passing over the first Black and woman vice president for another candidate would lead to a backlash from Black and women voters who are key to any victory, several Democratic strategists said.
'IMPOSSIBLE TO IGNORE KAMALA'
Still, Harris has been sidestepped in a lot of the speculation since the debate because some influential Democrats have little faith she can beat Trump, four of the sources said.
The United States has never elected a woman president, and Harris has spent much of her time as vice president struggling to distinguish herself in a role that is by definition a supporting one. As recently as last year, many inside the White House and the Biden campaign privately worried she was a liability for the campaign.
Since then, Harris has managed to find her stride on the issue of abortion rights but her polling has not improved significantly. Harris's approval ratings hover under 40%, but according to recent polling highlighted by the Biden campaign, she and the president have similar odds of beating Trump.
The vice president has also been consistently targeted by Republicans and conservative media in attacks many allies consider sexist and racist.
Three Democratic donors, who have recently been pushing for Biden to step aside, also said this week they think it will be ""impossible"" to sidestep Harris. The donors had been floating Whitmer and Newsom's names as possible alternatives until the past weekend.
""There is a real conversation in the Democratic party about leadership right now, but fair to say, and I'm not thrilled about this... it will be impossible to ignore Kamala,"" said one of the donors.
Another donor said ""she's nobody's choice, but yeah, nearly impossible.""
Still, the president's reelection campaign is standing its ground, emboldened by a stronger performance by Biden during a scripted speech in North Carolina even as calls for him to step aside grow.
Stephanie Cutter, deputy campaign manager for former President Barack Obama, whose firm is on contract to produce the Democratic National Convention in August, said ""President Biden is the nominee and he's going to remain the nominee.""
""For those who are looking for some sort of interparty fight, be careful what you wish for because that would ensure a Trump victory,"" she said in a statement.

https://www.citizen.digital/opinion-blogs/kenyas-protests-are-different-this-time-3-things-that-make-it-harder-for-government-to-crush-them-n345421,"Kenya’s protests are different this time: 3 things that make it harder for government to crush them
Legislators voted to pass the Finance Bill 2024 in its third and last reading ahead of presidential assent. This was the second countrywide protest over the proposed taxes in the draft law and excesses in government spending.
The finance bill is a framework that determines how the government raises revenue. The Kenyan government had proposed raising US$2.7 billion by increasing taxes on essential goods and services, from cooking oil to bread.
The bill also targeted digital revenue, where the bulk of young people generate their income in an environment with high rates of youth unemployment.
Kenyans took issue with plans to increase taxation that affects the working class and young people most, amid unnecessary government spending. This includes a US$7.8 million State House renovations budget.
Organising under the hashtag #RejectFinanceBill2024 started in earnest from 13 May 2024. Direct action gained momentum with protests on 18 June following significant online mobilisation.
Organising and direct action are not new to Kenya. The country has a long and healthy tradition of protests across its political history. This includes the 1990s pro-democracy movement and environmental justice organising led by the late Wangari Maathai to stop state encroachment on a forest reserve. There have also been economic and constitution-based mobilisations.
As part of this history, Kenyans are familiar with the use of the police to violently repress public protests. This often ends in death and other casualties.
I have studied protests and movements and have been part of political change across Africa for the last 15 years as an academic and civil society activist. In my view, the #RejectFinanceBill2024protests stand out for several reasons. I will focus on three:
- the absence of a central organisation leading the protests
- crowdsourcing the finances required
- a heightened trust deficit between citizens and the state
What’s different
The first factor that makes the current wave of protests different from previous ones is the absence of civil society organisations or political parties steering protest actions.
This is important because it avoids legitimate demands being sidetracked by the government framing them as opposition politics or distractions by “western-funded NGOs”, as has happened in the past.
It has also created the ability to mobilise across party, age and regional divides by focusing on the things that bind protesters – the equalising effect of bad economic policy. In doing so, it has pierced long-standing, easily politicised identity divisions in Kenya.
The second factor is the reliance on mutual aid as a framework to crowdsource financial resources. As of 3 July 2024, Kenyans had raised about US$234,000.
These funds have been used to pay hospital bills and funeral expenses brought on by the state’s response to protests. Lawyers and doctors have also offered pro bono services.
This approach to resourcing avoids divisions around ownership and attribution that often plague mobilisations. It also makes it harder for governments to claim that protest movements are funded by external actors seeking to destabilise the regime.
In the absence of a central financier, it has been difficult to isolate individuals who can be co-opted into negotiations with the regime. Co-opting “representatives” is a classic tactic used to destabilise and splinter movements.
This can be seen in President William Ruto’s creation of a National Multi-Sectoral Forum for dialogue. In making demands from within an amorphous structure, protesters could hold firm to their core demand to address systemic governance rot.
The third feature is the heightened trust deficit between society and the sitting government. Ruto’s leadership challenge was illustrated in a roundtable conversation with Kenyan media on 31 June. He failed to show empathy with Kenyans killed as a result of the protests despite evidence from the journalists.
This interview made Ruto look even more out of touch with the people he was elected to lead. In his initial response to the protests, he demonstrated that he was unable to read the mood of the country.
Ruto faces a serious leadership challenge, which is the loss of trust from the electorate that brought him into office. Despite asserting his commitment to stopping extrajudicial killings, he has presided over abductions and the use of brute force against protesters.
Ruto has adopted a classic tactic used to fracture movements, which is to discredit them through criminalisation. His subsequent change of tone by withdrawing assent to the finance bill on 26 June was a little too late.
What next
Significant transitions in Kenya have occurred through the voices of masses and never through the formal structures of political parties. The next few weeks will determine the future of the youth-led movement that was roused by the finance bill 2024.
The movement continues to hold firm but needs to move into a stronger coordination format. It must guard against the risk of leader-centricity, which the government would use to diffuse the movement.
Given that the political regime continues to use heavy handed security tactics and agent-provocateurs, organising needs to move off social media. To minimise the loss of life, protesters need to be three steps ahead of the regime where direct action is concerned.
Finally, can the movement heed the multiple ways in which class intersects with gender, youth, disability or ethnicity? The structuring of key demands must recognise how Kenya’s structural inequalities overlap.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/age-in-focus-as-biden-faces-trump-in-first-presidential-debate-n344749,"Age in focus as Biden faces Trump in first presidential debate
For 90 minutes on Thursday night, U.S. President Joe Biden has the chance to show doubting Americans that, at age 81, he is capable of handling the rigors of another four-year term, when he faces off in a debate against Republican Donald Trump.
A strong showing could help neutralize those concerns and focus voter attention on policy issues. A weak performance could dampen fundraising and push Trump further ahead in the polls.
Both men are under scrutiny over their age and stamina. Trump is 78 and prone to making outlandish statements and mangling his sentences on the campaign trail.
Biden has a stiff gait, makes verbal slip-ups and has inconsistent public appearances, sometimes veering from solidly delivered speeches to rushed, mumbled public remarks in the same day.
A recent Reuters-Ipsos poll showed that mental fitness is one of the key issues for undecided voters ahead of the Nov. 5 election, and they are more worried about Biden.
Another Reuters-Ipsos poll this year showed that 78% of respondents - including 71% of Democrats - thought Biden too old to work in government. Some 53% said the same of Trump.
Biden's age has been relentlessly targeted by political opponents and conservative media, who have used a stew of real, fake and misleadingly edited video clips aimed at portraying him as feeble and erratic.
The White House and Biden campaign have pushed back on the effort, with limited success.
Aware that this debate could be a defining moment for his campaign, Biden has confined himself to nearly a week of ""debate camp"" with top advisers at the Camp David presidential retreat in the mountains of western Maryland, where he will remain until departing for Atlanta on debate day.
The goal: Show U.S. voters a wise and steady leader with a record of success, in contrast to Trump's often chaotic 2017-21 presidency, and highlight differences on abortion rights, democratic norms and fiscal policy.
To do so, Biden is spending hours each day preparing while also taking his usual daily security briefings.
Many Democrats are anxious about how well Biden will do because the stakes are so high.
""It (the age issue) is obviously a challenge and an obstacle for Biden,"" said one Democrat close to the White House. ""I think it's always about, does he project strength and confidence? I think he's just got to demonstrate that he's in command of his agenda and confident on stage, and I think he'll do that.""
The debate will take place at a CNN studio in Atlanta with no audience. The men may not bring pre-written notes on stage.
John Morgan, a Florida attorney and Biden donor, said he would like to see Biden address the question of age right away during the debate.
Biden should ""talk about his physical and mental fitness compared to the other guy. He should challenge Trump to a Peloton ride and let the country see who is fitter and stronger. I'm not joking,"" Morgan said.
Biden's team has built a campaign aimed at protecting the president, who for most of his decades in public life was a loquacious presence, back-slapping with colleagues over a long Senate career and bantering with reporters.
Aides now stroll alongside him when he walks to his helicopter as a way of shifting focus away from his slow gait.
He wears comfortable soft-soled shoes and now gets aboard Air Force One via a shorter set of stairs, to limit the possibility of a misstep in front of the cameras.
The accommodations are more aesthetic than anything, said one former White House official, who does not believe they have worked.
""All these things that they do ... maybe mitigate risk for aesthetic reasons, (but) they don't necessarily help him,"" the former official said. ""They all add up to this over-handling that makes him look more feeble than he actually is.""
Democratic critics say Biden should spend more time engaged with the public and the press to sharpen his image and allay age concerns.
His allies say age is not the issue.
""This election's not about age. Joe and the other guy are about the same age. This election is about character, wisdom and ability,"" first lady Jill Biden said at an event in Philadelphia on Monday.
Biden's schedule and workload remain robust.
A Boston Globe analysis of Biden's 2023 travel found it to be on a par with Barack Obama and Trump during their third years in office. Biden visited 29 different states in 2023, compared with 30 states for Trump and 31 states for Obama, it said.
So far in 2024, Biden has made stops in 21 states at least once, according to statistics compiled by former CBS News White House correspondent Mark Knoller.
Earlier this month he did back-to-back trips to Europe, attending D-Day anniversary celebrations in France and a G7 summit in Italy.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/i-dont-steal-david-ndii-reveals-his-monthly-pay-n344622,"'I don't steal': David Ndii reveals his monthly pay
Taking to his X platform, Ndii revealed that he received Ksh.666,364 salary in May 2024 and drew comparisons with his consulting work whereby he earned Ksh.417,600 for his services.
“This is my pay, and I don’t steal. Next to it a typical invoice from my consulting work. You can do the math, my monthly pay is less than two days work. I’m not in this for money. Been there done that,” he said.
Ndii’s revelation came amid criticism that his team, Ruto’s Council of Economic Advisers, received Ksh.1.1 billion in the budget.
At the time, Kenyans poked holes on the bloated wage bill from the government which claims to have inherited empty coffers from the previous regime.
“Advisers are not paid entertainment allowance. The budget is for meetings. Our job entails policy development and implementation oversight. That means convening meetings typically 3-4 per day with 10-30 people each. The biggest facility in our office is boardrooms,” Ndii said in May 2024.
Ndii has in the past week been a fierce critic of the protests staged nationwide against the Finance Bill 2024.
Kenyans have been up in arms over the amount of taxes collected by the government, seeking an audit to determine how every coin is spent.
Taking to the streets, Gen Zs demand the government to repeal the entire Finance Bill and uphold accountability.

In August 2023, SRC published a list of salary increments for all state officers except the president and his deputy as part of its third review cycle. The proposals took effect from July 1, 2024.
Now, Jalang'o says he is not interested in the increment, joining a host of other legislators who have since rejected the new salaries.
""There are things that almost look like a setup! We are in a crisis and SRC are proposing an increment of 14K! Yaani mnataka tupigwe tukufe ndio mfurahi? Mimi sitaki!,"" Jalang'o wrote in a social media post.
Members of Parliament have recently received attacks from members of the public, after a majority voted 'YES' to the tax proposals in the 2024 Finance Bill.
The Bill not only led to nationwide protests but also the destruction of a number of businesses of MPs who were in its support.
Nationwide protests led to President William Ruto rejecting the Bill in totality, sending it back to parliament for amendments.
The salary increment for legislators and state officials has drawn angry reactions from Kenyans as it was among the issues that protesters wanted government to address.
On his part, President Ruto has promised austerity measures that seek to address the gaps left by the the rejection of proposals in Finance Bill 2024. Among them is scrapping of unconstitutional offices like that of the First Lady.
Ruto has also said his government will focus on key projects in the Financial year 2024/2025.

https://www.citizen.digital/opinion-blogs/opinion-how-communication-gaps-fueled-a-revolution-in-kenya-n345022,"OPINION: How communication gaps fueled a revolution in Kenya
Recent events in Kenya have highlighted a critical issue that can have far-reaching consequences: the failure of effective communication. For communication to be truly effective, it must involve three critical elements: listening, clear messaging, and concrete action.
These three pillars form a magical communication triangle that works wonders. Leave out one of the three, and communication will always falter. In essence, effective communication goes beyond sharing information. Listening and concrete action must be present.
Additionally, for communication to be effective, the three pillars must follow a clear sequence. First, listening to the public and engaging with their concerns should precede any messaging. To create messages without listening to people is like singing off-key.
Such messages fall flat at best, and, at worst, they repel and even anger listeners. Subsequently, listening must result in concrete responses about any issues raised, the incorporationof valid suggestions into subsequent decisions, and tangible actions.
In the recent past, Kenya has witnessed a wave of national outrage and riots, a clear indication that, among other things, the government's communication strategy has faltered on multiple fronts.
1. Lack of Listening
A notable failure that preceded the recent national outrage we have witnessed in Kenya has been the government's lack of engagement with the voices of the people. When citizens feel unheard, their frustration grows, leading to a heightened sense of alienation and anger.
This lack of listening contributed significantly to the fever-pitch outrage observed in the country. Effective communication is a two-way street. It is not enough for leaders to simply broadcast their messages; they must also listen to the needs, interests, concerns, and expectations of their audience.
2. Lack of Adequate Resonant Information
The information disseminated to the public has consistently lacked the necessary depth and clarity to address the concerns of the people. When citizens feel that their needs and questions are not being met with transparent and substantial responses, it fuels uncertainty and fear, contributing to unrest and anger.
In times of crisis, citizens look to their leaders for clear, consistent, and resonant information. Yet, most of the messages by the government have not reflected the mood and desires of the people, possibly pointing to a situation where message drafters did not incorporate insights from strategic listening, if they had listened at all. The absence of insights-driven messaging has led to confusion and mistrust.
3. Contradictory Actions
The Kenyan public has continually observed discrepancies between what was communicated and what was done. Inconsistency between messages and actions undermines the credibility of leadership, as people struggle to reconcile the differences between words and deeds.
Such contradictions not only erode trust but also provide fertile ground for rumors and misinformation, which can rapidly escalate into widespread dissent and protests.
The Role of Seasoned Communication Experts
Having practiced communication for over two decades, I am convinced that the need for seasoned communication experts within government cannot be overstated. Here are three critical ways in which their involvement can bring about positive change:
1. Strategic Listening and Engagement
Seasoned communication experts will facilitate strategic listening to the public. They can establish channels of genuine engagement, allowing citizens to voice their concerns and feel heard.
Strategic listening will foster a sense of inclusion and significantly reduce feelings of alienation and anger. When Kenyans believe their voices matter, they will be less likely to resort to protests.
2. Crafting Clear Insights-Driven Messages
Experienced communication professionals will craft messages that are clear, consistent, and resonate with the public. They understand the importance of strategic messaging that incorporates the needs, interests, concerns, and expectations of the people.
They will, therefore, ensure that the information disseminated is coherent and trustworthy. This will then reduce confusion and build a foundation of trust between the government of Kenya and its citizens.
3. Aligning Actions with Words
One of the most critical aspects of effective communication is ensuring that actions align with words. Seasoned communication experts understand that for messages to be credible, they must be backed by concrete actions.
They can advise government leaders on how to implement policies and initiatives that reflect their statements, ensuring consistency between what is said and what is done. This alignment is essential for building and maintaining trust.
When citizens see that their government not only listens to them but also acts on their feedback and concerns, they will likely be pacified. Moreover, an openness to acknowledge mistakes and correct them transparently can further enhance trust and cooperation, ultimately leading to a more stable and harmonious society.
Proactive Crisis Management
In times of crisis, communication experts are crucial in managing the narrative and mitigating panic. They can anticipate public reactions and prepare strategic responses that address concerns before they escalate.
The recent riots in Kenya underscore the devastating impact of poor communication. To prevent such crises, it is imperative for governments to prioritize effective communication strategies. For communication to be truly effective, it must involve three critical elements: strategic listening, clear messaging, and concrete action.
Listening to the public and engaging with their concerns should precede any messaging. Aligning actions with words and maintaining openness is pivotal for governments that want to build trust, reduce unrest, and create a more harmonious society.
The Need for PR Regulation
The failures observed in Kenya's recent communication breakdown underscore the necessity of a regulatory framework governing the practice of public relations in Kenya. By instituting a law that mandates the engagement of seasoned communication professionals and sets standards for strategic listening, message crafting, and aligning actions with words, the Kenya government will ensure more reliable and effective communication.
A PR law will not only professionalize communication efforts but also protect public interest by fostering transparency, trust, and accountability. This regulatory approach will serve as a safeguard against misinformation, enhance public confidence, and contribute to a more informed and stable society.

Published on: July 05, 2024 06:59 (EAT)

Hosts Germany take on Spain in the first of two blockbuster quarter-final ties at Euro 2024 on Friday, with Kylian Mbappe's France up against Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal in the late match.
Germany and Spain clash in Stuttgart at 1600 GMT with the host nation putting their hopes on the line against probably the best-performing side at the tournament thus far.
Spain, with the thrilling duo of Lamine Yamal and Nico Williams on the wings, have reached the quarter-finals with four wins in as many games, nine goals scored and just one conceded.
Germany, meanwhile, have also impressed on their run to the last eight, with Jamal Musiala outstanding in attack and Toni Kroos pulling the strings in midfield as he prepares to retire after the competition.
The match, a repeat of the Euro 2008 final won 1-0 by Spain in Vienna, therefore promises to be a thriller.
""My focus is less on Yamal, more on Jamal,"" Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann said Thursday as he compared the two opposing stars and indicated that his team planned to take the game to the Spanish.
""We can do something in attack ourselves. We want to attack and make life difficult for them.""
The match would have been a fitting final given both teams' current form and their historical standing -- the nations are the most successful in the history of the European Championship with three titles each.
They also met in the group stage at the 2022 World Cup, playing out a 1-1 draw that contributed to Germany being eliminated in the first round.
""Three wins away from immortality"" was the headline in Thursday's edition of Kicker, the popular German football magazine, yet the host nation's dream of winning the trophy in Berlin on July 14 could also end here.
Spain have perhaps the world's best holding midfield player in Rodri, but their coach, Luis de la Fuente, admitted they are wary of the brilliance of Kroos.
""We thought about tying Kroos's feet together, but I'm not sure if UEFA will let me,"" he joked.
""We know how Kroos behaves. We will try and make sure he doesn't have the chance to receive the ball and will limit his passing options.""
The winners of that match will advance to a semi-final against either France or Portugal, who go head-to-head in Hamburg at 1900 GMT.
It is another heavyweight clash between two much-fancied sides, as well as a repeat of the Euro 2016 final, when Portugal beat France 1-0 in extra time in Paris.
France have reached a sixth quarter-final in the last seven major tournaments despite not one of their players scoring in open play.
Mbappe meets idol Ronaldo
Les Bleus have netted only three times in four games, with one a penalty by Mbappe and the other two coming from own goals, including Jan Vertonghen's which allowed them to beat Belgium in the last 16.
Mbappe has been hindered by a broken nose, which saw him miss one group game before returning to action while wearing a protective face mask. He also suggested on Thursday that he is not currently fully fit.
""I don't think I'm fully fit. It's not an excuse, but I think to be really at 100 percent, explosive and fast, I need a proper pre-season with my club,"" he said.
Mbappe, who recently signed for Real Madrid, will come up against his boyhood idol in Ronaldo, the Portugal captain who is now 39.
""It is an honour. Everyone knows how much I have always admired Cristiano,"" Mbappe, 25, said.
""Whatever has happened before or will happen after, he will remain a legend in the game, but of course, we hope to win tomorrow and get through to the semi-final.""
Ronaldo is enduring a difficult tournament, failing to find the net and ending up in tears after missing a penalty in the last-16 tie against Slovenia from which Portugal squeezed through on penalties.
Portugal coach Roberto Martinez, meanwhile, insisted the focus cannot solely be on the two opposing superstars.
""Football is a team sport. Tomorrow is not a match between two individuals. They are two incredible players who have a big influence on the game worldwide, and that influence will continue, but tomorrow we will need a real top-level team performance if we are to win,"" Martinez said.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/central-region-churches-to-hold-7-days-of-mourning-for-protest-victims-n345061,"Central region churches to hold 7 days of mourning for protest victims
The National Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK) in the Central Region is marking seven days of mourning for victims of the anti-government protests and is set to hold memorial services on Sunday inline with the Saba Saba commemorations.
NCCK
Central Region Chairman Bishop Dr. Timothy Gichere made the announcement on
Tuesday saying that in addition to the commemoration service slated for July 7,
2024, which honours fallen heroes and freedom fighters in pre-colonial history,
this year’s Saba Saba celebrations will also remember those who have died in the
ongoing protests.
Bishop
Gichere invited the public to grace the services that will be held in all Central
region’s churches, as he also condoled with the families of those who lost
their loved ones in the ongoing demonstrations.
“It
is with deep sadness that we send condolences to all those who have lost their
loved ones due to police brutality in the last two weeks. We are also praying
for a quick recovery for all those injured,” he said.
“To
further honor their sacrifice, we are continuing with marking 7 days of
mourning that will culminate in memorial services in all our churches on Sunday
July 7, 2024. We welcome all Kenyans to join us as we mark Saba Saba in the
churches honouring all heroes and freedom fighters.”
The statement came after a two-day NCCK induction workshop held at Bethany House,
Sagana, for officials elected to the council’s committees in Embu, Kirinyaga,
Murang’a, Nyeri, Nyandarua and Laikipia counties.
The
Bishop appealed to the President William Ruto-led administration to listen to
the cries and pleas of Kenyans, underscoring that the time for “chest-thumping
and bravado is over.”
He expressed his dissatisfaction with the government over its continued
adamancy in addressing the protests, noting that they should have already
devised a way to address the issues raised by demonstrators by now.
“The
Bible in Proverbs 15: 22 points out that ‘plans fail for lack of counsel, but
with many advisors they succeed.’ It is of absolute importance that in
reshaping our nation, we listen to each other,” said the NCCK Central Chair.
“In
this regard, we call upon all leaders, especially political, religious and
social, to keenly listen to the people so as to discern and honour their will.
The season of chest-thumping and bravado is over. We find it quite unfortunate
that the young people of Kenya are getting into a second week of demonstrations
without their issues being heard or addressed comprehensively.”
The
Bishop further expressed the NCCK’s support for the demonstrations, reiterating
that the youth who make up more than 70 per cent of the country’s
population are well within their democratic rights.
He
thus condemned the recent killings and violence meted out to protesters by the
police, opining that the officers should instead provide security to the
protesters as stipulated in the law.
“Over
the last two weeks, the youth of Kenya have come out to exercise their right to
peaceful picketing as they contribute to the reshaping of our nation. We demand
that the government stops curtailing this right by using the police to
violently break up peaceful demonstrations,” stated Bishop Gichere.
“We
reiterate that the role of the police this week is to escort and provide
security to the Kenyans who have given notice of picketing in different parts
of the country.”
At
the same time, he urged the National Police Service to cease from imposing fear
to demonstrators through unlawful arrests and abductions reported in the past
weeks.
He
tasked Inspector General of Police Japhet Koome to publicly account for all the
people arrested during the protests and those in detention.
“The
use of excessive force that includes shooting demonstrators must be stopped.
Further, all the demonstrators who were arrested last week should be
unconditionally released since they were exercising their constitutional
rights,” Bishop Gichere said.
“We
in addition call upon the Inspector General to publicly account for all
individuals who have been abducted or clandestinely arrested by the security
agents. This trend of imposing fear on the people must be ended.”

Germany are through to the quarter finals of a major tournament for the first time in eight years, but clouds remain for Julian Nagelsmann's Euro 2024 hosts.
The home side won 2-0 in Dortmund, coming up not only against a determined and organised Denmark, but also a 25-minute thunderstorm delay which derailed Germany's early momentum.
In a match Nagelsmann called ""bizarre"" and ""wild"", Germany needed a fair share of luck to get past the Danes, with two VAR reviews within a minute going in favour of the hosts.
Nagelsmann's unforced changes to his starting XI will also come under fire, particularly the decision to replace the in-form Florian Wirtz with Leroy Sane, who had another frustrating night.
Having ridden out the storm on Saturday, Germany will hope for a clearer week ahead, particularly with a potential clash with in-form Spain on the horizon.
The first surprise of an unpredictable evening came when the starting XI was announced, with Nagelsmann making two changes to his starting line-up -- the first time he has done so in 2024.
Since sweeping the broom through Germany's squad in March, only injuries have stopped Nagelsmann playing his strongest XI.
Nagelsmann's decision to replace the defensive-focused Maximilian Mittelstaedt with the attack-minded David Raum was a reward for the latter's assist for Niclas Fuellkrug's late equaliser against Switzerland.
The other unforced change was difficult to understand, with Nagelsmann dropping Wirtz for Sane, who showed pace but struggled with control and timing.
Nagelsmann explained the decision, saying he wanted to ""reward a good week of training, as well as bring some speed into the game.
""(Sane) has got different characteristics than Flo.""
Wirtz, 21, came on with nine minutes remaining and was an immediate upgrade, holding up possession and finding runners.
The coach's decision to again pick Kai Havertz over Fuellkrug also raised eyebrows, despite the Arsenal forward converting a second-half penalty.
In general play, Havertz had a number of chances but could not break through. His 10th-minute volley was saved by Danish goalie Kasper Schmeichel, with the goalkeeper gobbling up a tame Havertz header from point-blank range shortly before the break.
With Germany 1-0 up and 30 minutes remaining, Havertz broke through with only the goalkeeper to beat. The goal would have sealed the game for Germany but Havertz chipped wide.
Fortunately for Germany, Jamal Musiala had killer instinct when it mattered, scoring on the counter with 22 minutes remaining to wrap up the game.
Musiala has now scored in three of Germany's four games at Euro 2024, the 21-year-old having established himself as the hosts' most reliable attacking force.
The match again highlighted Germany's noted problems from dead-ball situations.
A pre-tournament talking point, Germany conceded an own goal from a set piece against Scotland. Against Hungary, Nagelsmann's side were fortunate when a free-kick goal was ruled out for offside.
Minutes into the second-half, Denmark took a free kick which pinged around the box before Joachim Andersen turned it in.
A lengthy VAR review showed Andersen was a mere centimetre offside.
In the post-match press conference, Denmark manager Kasper Hjulmand held up his phone to show the VAR images, telling reporters ""it's one centimetre.
""It doesn' make sense. It's not how we are supposed to be using VAR.""
Moments after the goal was disallowed, Germany went up the other end and won a penalty, but the way Andersen was able to get a shot away despite the attention of several flat-footed Germany defenders will concern the coach.
With the quarter finals in sight, defender Joshua Kimmich summed up the uneven nature of the match -- and Germany's tournament so far.
""We're on a good run,"" the Bayern Munich defender said, adding ""we know that we can beat anyone - but that we can also be beaten.""

Harambee Stars Assistant Coach Ken Odhiambo has advised football
coaches at the grassroots to invest more in quality player development, instead
of laying more focus in winning local tournaments.
The Emerging Stars Head Coach has also appealed to coaches at the
grassroots to take advantage of the coaching courses being offered by Football
Kenya Federation (FKF), to ensure they give players the best basics for
beautiful game.
Speaking during the launch of Rashid Abdallah Super Cup in
Ukunda, Kwale County on Sunday, Odhiambo underlined the need for focusing on
the “real deal,” as opposed to glory that comes with winning tournaments.
""Most of us are results oriented but we forget that these
players are humans and there is the aspect of development which is very
critical to every player. We must make their future bright and not force them
to give results while ignoring the bigger picture, the real deal.
""We should not focus much on the prize money in every
tournament. Instead, we should be asking how many players will be ready for bigger
clubs after such tournaments. This has more value,” said the ex-Kenyan
international.
Renowned media personality Rashid Abdalla - the Patron of competition
which enters the fifth edition this year, acknowledged remarkable strides has
been made since the inaugural tournament but noted more ground can be covered.
""We want the tournament to be as inclusive and expansive as much as possible, to empower more of our youths. That is why we have now invited a few teams from Mombasa County. We want it to be a game changer to our youths,"" noted Abdallah.
For the first time, six teams have been invited from Mombasa County for the tournament which has attracted a total of 32 teams.
Defending Champions Kitivo United won 2 - 0 against Black Eagles
in last season’s final, with the Most Valuable Player Hamisi Mwaphalu joining
Kenyan Premier League side Bandari FC.
Kitivo United will play their opening match of this year’s
edition against Mende FC of Mombasa on August 11.
The winner will take home Sh. 2 million and a get a chance to play Bandari FC; and a yet to be confirmed Tanzanian Premier League side.
The football extravaganza has also given birth to Rashid Abdalla
Foundation which has been in forefront in community empowerment programs
including face-lifting of Waa Primary School classes and the school’s playing grounds.

Kenya clinched the Africa Kabaddi 2024 Championship title Saturday evening after thrashing Uganda 44-23 in the final match of the series held at Kasarani.
Kenya started the match strongly with James Kamweti producing a couple of successful raids in Uganda's half to put Kenya ahead at half time with a score of 20-13.
An outstanding team performance from Kenya in the second half saw them add a total of 24 points to the tally with Uganda adding 10 points to close the match at full time with a score of 44 - 23.
Kenya's defence was a tough wall for Ugandan raiders to climb as every attempt to raid was met with superb tackles from the kenyan covers to ensure all points remained with the home team.
The win means that Kenya will take part in the upcoming Kabaddi World Cup.
Kamweti, who was also named as man of the match after his impressive display, bragged that Kenya are african giants in Kabaddi after the commanding win.
""We are looking forward to meeting big teams like India and Iran because in Africa we are the giants,"" a confident Kamweti said.
Kenya's captain David Silishia heaped praise on the team, saying they are already looking forward to the World Cup.
""We are happy and we thank God for the win. It was a good team performance and we have gotten the results. We have a very good team. With proper support we can do better at the World Cup,"" he said.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/thousands-flee-their-homes-as-israeli-forces-bomb-southern-gaza-n345072,"Thousands flee their homes as Israeli forces bomb southern Gaza
Israeli forces bombarded several areas of the southern Gaza Strip on Tuesday and thousands of Palestinians fled their homes in what could be part of a final push of Israel's intensive military operations in nine months of war.
Eight Palestinians were killed and dozens wounded, health officials said. Israel's military said that two soldiers had been killed in battle a day earlier.
Israel's leaders have said they were winding down the phase of intense fighting against Hamas, the Islamist group that has governed Gaza since 2007, and would soon shift into more targeted operations.
Later on Tuesday, 17 Palestinians were killed in Israeli tank shelling of a street in the densely populated Zeitoun neighbourhood in Gaza City in the north of the Strip, medics said.
Footage on some Palestinian social media that Reuters was not immediately able to verify showed the scene at a local market, with bread scattered on a floor stained with blood.
The Israeli army had ordered residents of several towns and villages in eastern Khan Younis to evacuate their homes on Monday, prior to tanks re-entering the area the military had left several weeks ago.
Thousands who had not heeded the call were forced to flee their homes in the dark overnight, as Israeli tanks and planes bombed Karara, Abassan and other areas that had been named in the evacuation orders, residents and Hamas media said.
""Where will we go?"" said Tamer, a 55-year-old businessman, who has been displaced six times since Oct. 7.
""Every time people go back to their homes and begin to rebuild some of their lives even on the rubble of their houses, the occupation sends the tanks back to destroy what is left,"" he told Reuters via a chat app.
The Israeli military said its forces had struck areas in Khan Younis from where around 20 rockets had been fired on Monday. Targets included weapon storage facilities and operational centres, it added.
It said measures were taken before the strikes to ensure civilians were unharmed by enabling them to evacuate from the area, referring to the evacuation orders.
The military accused Hamas of using civilian infrastructure and the wider population as human shields. The Islamist group denies that.
Islamic Jihad, an allied group of Hamas, took credit for firing the rockets.
The war in Gaza began when Hamas burst into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killed 1,200 people and took around 250 hostages, including civilians and soldiers, back into Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.
The offensive launched by Israel in retaliation has killed nearly 38,000 people, according to the Gaza health ministry, and has left the heavily built-up coastal enclave in ruins.
The Gaza health ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants, but officials say most of the dead are civilians. Israel says 320 of its soldiers have been killed in Gaza and that at least a third of the Palestinian dead are fighters.
Within the areas subject to evacuation orders was the European Gaza Hospital, which serves both Khan Younis and Rafah, and medical officials had to evacuate patients and families who had taken shelter in the facility, witnesses and medics said.
Some residents headed west towards the Mawasi area by the beach, which is designated as a humanitarian area but is overcrowded by displaced families.
Some slept in the street as they could not find shelter.
Israel says that its operation in Rafah, in southern Gaza near the border with Egypt, that was meant to stamp out Hamas in its final redoubt will soon be concluded.
After the intense phase of the war is over, its forces will focus on smaller-scale operations meant to stop Hamas from regrouping, officials say.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was nearing its goal of destroying the military capabilities of Hamas. Less intense operations would continue, he said.
Hamas and Islamic Jihad continue to stage attacks against Israeli forces operating inside Gaza and fire rockets into Israel.
Hamas says Israel has failed to achieve the goals of the war and the group is ready to fight for years.
Efforts to secure a ceasefire and the release of hostages in Gaza have stalled. Hamas says any deal must end the war and bring a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.
Israel says it will accept only temporary pauses in the fighting until Hamas is eradicated.

2023 Coast Region
Secondary School soccer champions, Serani Secondary School, are out to defend
their Mombasa County title as the county Term Two ball games kick off Tuesday,
July 2, 2024.
The games
are scheduled to take place in Jomvu and Changamwe constituencies after being
postponed two weeks ago.
Serani
Secondary School team, under the stewardship of coach Alex Shikanga and Cach
Swaleh Abdallah, will be out to continue their soccer dominance at the Coast
region, with last year playing their way to the national level.
According
to the team head coach Alex Shikanga, the boys are ready for the task to
successfully defend their title.
“As you
know Bandari Youth FC has a contract with Serani Secondary School, so most of
my players have been actively involved in the ongoing FKF Coast Region league,
and I can comfortably confirm that we are ready for Tuesday,” said
Shikanga.
“Every year
we strive to reach the national level and immediately after that we start
preparing for the coming year, that's why we are different,” he added.
With their
superstar Willy Gitama away with the U23 national team, Emerging Stars, at the COSAFA
Cup tournament in South Africa, coach Shikanga is confident other students will
step up and fill the gap.
“We will
miss Willy but we are happy he made it to the national team for the COSAFA
tournament, and we hope he will represent us well. We have capable players for
the task but we are afraid in a month’s time we will lose four more players who
made it to national Chapa Dimba team and are heading to Spain for a tournament,”
noted coach Shikanga.
The players
are Baraka Rodgers, goalkeeper Francis Katana, David Wanyama and Khamis Nyale.
According to
Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association (KSSSA) Mombasa County Secretary,
Silas Atsulu, preparations are complete ahead of the championship.
“Everything
is ready, but we are worried about the planned anti-government protests set for
Tuesday, so our team is on the lookout and we will advise accordingly since the
students’ safety comes first,” he said.
Serani are
in Group B with Miritini Complex, Khadija Secondary School and St. Charles
Lwanga.
Group A
consists of Moi Forces Academy MFA, Marimani Secondary School, Tononoka
Secondary School and Miritini Secondary School.
Last year, Serani were crowned Mombasa County champions
after edging out hosts Changamwe Secondary School 3-0.

""How did the criminals know there was an armoury and a mausoleum in Parliament?"" ""They went straight for the armoury and musoleum, indicating they were organised criminals,"" Ruto said.
He insisted that his administration would conduct thorough investigations and track down the criminals who invaded and torched Parliament, the Judiciary, and Nairobi County Government offices.
The president also denied that he has blood on his hands for the deaths of 24 people during the protests, saying that his government will look into the deaths.
When pressed to explain the abduction of former Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter on Sunday, Ruto claimed that Kater had ignored a summons to appear before the police.
He referred to a statement by DCI that Keter was arrested for alleged firearms laundering.

In a statement on X, Kenya Red Cross distanced itself from the allegations, highlighting that its only role in the protests has been rushing injured Kenyans, in need of medical assistance, to hospitals.
According to the humanitarian agency, its staffers, volunteers and vehicles have been injured and destroyed respectively during the demonstrations.
""Our vehicles have been attacked. Staff and volunteers injured. We have no contact or role in transporting persons other than the injured. The rumours must stop,"" said Kenya Red Cross.
""It is quite unfair that we are being accused of whisking members of parliament while our staff and volunteers put their lives in danger to provide critical medical care to those in need.""
The organization likewise urged the government to provide it with ample security to carry out its mandate to respond to humanitarian emergencies and alleviate human suffering.
""We can't provide life-saving interventions without access and safety for our staff and volunteers. It is crucial that we are granted access to continue our humanitarian efforts without hindrance,"" it said.

the president,” Mandera East MP Abdullahi Bashir said.
The leaders also faulted the second in command over his
remarks underscoring that the NIS was not to blame for the demonstrations.
“There is no problem between the Muslim and Kikuyu nation,
there is no problem between the Luos and the Kikuyu there is no problem with anybody
Somali Kiisii Luhya Kenyans are one family. Politicians who are self-seeking
would try and divide this country against ethnic lines along regional lines and
we are telling the deputy president,” Dadaab MP Farah Maalim said.
Isiolo County Senator Fatma Dullo added, “The security lapse
that happened Tuesday if we are to blame we blame all security apparatus, not
one security, you do not expect NIS to go on the road or to go to the
parliament and protect parliament but the way it has come out that is personal
attack.”
The leaders gave an ultimatum to the DP urging him to step
down if he was not happy with the government and consider starting early presidential
campaigns to succeed Ruto in 2027.
“If he is not happy with the government let him resign from this administration and let him prepare in the 2027 contest so he can run as a presidential candidate and if he is going to be popular with the Kenyan people we will see what he is going to do,” said Maalim.
Gachagua on Wednesday demanded that National Intelligence Service (NIS) Director General Noordin Haji step down from his position to pave the way for a more competent Director General.
Addressing the press in Mombasa, a seemingly agitated DP
blamed the NIS for the current anti-government protests which he said have led
to deaths and destruction.
He said that the NIS failed in its mandate to inform the head of state of the situation on the ground before the citizens took to the streets.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/hosting-x-space-conversation-with-gen-zs-is-a-big-mistake-president-ruto-told-n345268,"Hosting X Space conversation with Gen Zs is a big mistake, President Ruto told
Former Agriculture Minister Kipruto Kirwa has
advised President William Ruto against holding a conversation on the X
(formerly Twitter) platform with the Gen Zs to discuss issues affecting the
country.
Kirwa termed
the move as a “big mistake” as a majority of Kenyans are dissatisfied with the
current administration’s past two years in power.
He said that
the President should have remained at the background and allowed for other
organs of the government to interact with the Kenyan youth and only appear when
called upon.
“The President
should refrain from being in the forefront of every fire. The meeting with Gen
Z is ill advised. It is a big mistake,” he said in an interview on KTN News
“What he
should have done is to see how the various organs of government should have
interfaced with the young people and at the right time he comes in when he is
called to do so.”
Further, the
former United Democratic Alliance (UDA) Vice Chairperson advised Cabinet
Secretaries and their advisors to speak in one voice to ensure effective
operations at their various ministries.
He warned the
Head of State against surrounding himself with advisors at the expense of his
CSs, terming it a recipe for disaster.
“Advisors
are not bad per se but they must sit in the architecture of the ministry so
that they’re seen to be supporting the minister and not forming another
sub-committee of the Cabinet,” Kirwa pointed out.
“The danger
is if the President was to surround himself with the advisors at the exclusion
of the ministers, there is going to be a lot of information conflict.”
The President,
alongside his Cabinet, is set to host an X space on Friday from 2pm to 5pm to
discuss critical issues voiced by the Kenyan youth in the past weeks of
anti-government protests.
Kenyans
online have, however, dismissed the conversation, citing that the President and
the Cabinet should be invited to talk on a space hosted by the Gen Zs.

Recounting his experience during the protest, a group of youths from Kitengela have expressed disappointment at why demos turned violent and fatal.
Kerray Mildred, a man just at the border of the Generation Z, being born in 1997, said he was happy to participate in the protests.
He participated in a smaller protest that happened on the streets of Kitengela town in Kajiado county.
“Many traders were conducting their business as usual as protests happened,” Mildred said.
In Nairobi’s Central Business District (CBD), which was one of the main areas where protesters convened, police officers engaged them in running battles, lobbing tear gas canisters and water canons at protesters.
Mildred said such scenes were not witnessed in Kitengela, and instead some protesters engaged officers, explaining to them that what they were demanding for with a rejection of the Bill was to benefit them.
“They understood and we gave them drinking water. We understand their responsibility to ensure our safety and they understand why we are protesting,” he said.
Gen Z were seen distributing water and milk to officers as they proceeded with protests.
Another protester, Michael Wakaba, said that it was disappointing to lose lives when people are holding peaceful protests.
""It is the right of every citizen to participate in protests as long as they are peaceful,"" he said.
In other sections, protesters helped each other when they needed medical attention or when they were at risk of being arrested.
However, in many sections of the country, the story was different, with police and protesters appearing to be on opposite sides.
Both local leaders and the international community have condemned Tuesday’s protests, which left at least five people killed.
Protesters made their way to Parliament and accessed the buildings, leaving a trail of destruction.
President William Ruto declared that the peaceful protests had turned violent and that the culprits would face the law.
The government deployed the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) to maintain peace.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/cs-chelugui-at-pains-to-explain-why-crb-doesnt-have-access-to-hustler-fund-data-n345548,"CS Chelugui at pains to explain why CRB doesn’t have access to Hustler Fund data
Cooperatives and MSMEs Cabinet Secretary Simon Chelugui was
on Tuesday tasked to explain why the Credit Reference Bureau (CRB) does not yet
have access to Hustler Fund data and information to enable help the customers build
a good credit history.
CS Chelugui who spoke on Citizen TV’s Tonight Show fumbled
on his words in giving perspective to the issue despite saying that the
government was working to ensure the Fund’s users had a good credit score,
which is the sole mandate of CRB.
He said that the government was yet to actualize a good
partnership with CRB and was still banking on more time to develop a
relationship.
“We haven’t reached there because we are only 18 months; it
is a product we are developing but ultimately we believe we will have the
largest information on Credit Bureau,” said Chelugui.
“We have not closed anyone out, especially the CRB. We are
actually developing a partnership with CRB right now but we needed to build
some database so that by the time we engage because we are approaching 2 years
by November this year, we will have enough information.”
The show host Yvonne Okwara wondered why 18 months into President William Ruto’s flagship project, the CS was still arguing that the government
required more time, adding that the taxpayers deserve accountability.
In his response, Chelugui said, “We need to see the
borrowers transact at least 3 times.”
Okwara disputed the CS’s sentiment reminding him of his
earlier claim that about 2 million borrowers had borrowed over 10 times.
“You are saying 2 to 3 times but you did say that the ones
that you have graduated or rehabilitated have borrowed up to 10 times, so why
is the information not available to the CRB?” She asked.
In a rejoinder, Chelugui however claimed that the aforesaid
group of people had, according to the government
obtained a good credit score but the
same tool used by the government to determine the credit score was yet to be
adopted by CRB.
“We have 2 million borrowers who according to us have
demonstrated good credit status and borrowed over 10 times,” said the CS.
He added, “We believe in the next two years we can still
deepen information from these hustlers and as I speak to you, we are engaged with
CRB to develop a scoring tool for them …it is not all lost.”
Okwara however wondered why the CRB and the
government used a different scoring tool to address the same issue.
“What is wrong with the scoring tool that they have?"" She
posed.
The CS in his response said the CRB has a high scorecard as
compared to the government since they deal with banks and other big financial institutions,
a claim which resulted in a back and forth as the interviewer sought to acquire facts.
“The scoring tool they have could be very high because one,
the way they structured their scoring is mostly from banks or big financial
institutions,” he said.
Yvonne noted: ""Actually they take their scoring from every lending
institution Saccos, Banks and digital lenders.""
Chelugui responded: ""Those are conventional Financial institutions. This
is a fellow who we went out, picked up his phone got Ksh.500, narrowed again
and built history.""
“We are trying to reconfigure the system and see how best we
can do. We have a social responsibility to bring them into the financial space.”

The Biden administration will expand
deportation relief and work permits to an estimated 309,000 Haitians in the
country already, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said Friday.
The administration will expand access to the
Temporary Protected Status program to Haitians through February 2026 because of
violence and security issues in Haiti that limits access to safety, health
care, food and water, the department said. The expanded program will be
available to Haitians in the U.S. on or before June 3.
About 264,000 Haitians in the U.S. were
already covered by the program, according to the U.S. government.
U.S. President Joe Biden, a Democrat seeking
another term in the November 5 elections, has walked a political tightrope when
it comes to immigration, both trying to step up security at the U.S.-Mexico
border and take a more humane approach to immigrants in the U.S. illegally.
In a presidential debate on Thursday, Biden's
Republican challenger, former president Donald Trump, criticized Biden for
failing to stem high levels of illegal immigration.
Gang wars in Haiti have displaced over half a
million people and nearly 5 million are facing severe food insecurity. Armed
groups, which now control most of the capital, have formed a broad alliance
while carrying out widespread killings, ransom kidnappings and sexual violence.

In a statement issued on Tuesday, the KVA criticized the deployment of horses in crowd control, labeling it as unethical and inhumane. They highlighted that horses, sensitive and sentient beings, could suffer stress, fear, and physical harm in chaotic situations involving loud noises and large crowds.
The association drew a poignant historical parallel, likening the use of horses in crowd dispersal to colonial-era tactics that used animals as tools of aggression. They emphasized that such actions not only endangered animal welfare but also undermined public trust and the principles of democracy enshrined in Kenya's Constitution.
Beyond animal welfare concerns, the KVA expressed deep concern over the excessive use of force by police against peaceful demonstrators. They condemned these actions as a violation of fundamental freedoms, including the right to peaceful assembly and expression.
The association also denounced the abduction of individuals by alleged state agents, stressing that such acts eroded democratic principles and human rights protections.
Calling for respect for both animal and human rights, the KVA urged the government and law enforcement agencies to uphold the highest standards of conduct. They demanded the immediate release of unlawfully detained individuals and called for an end to the targeting of professionals providing humanitarian aid during times of civil unrest.
Meanwhile, the organization has pledged to continue speaking out against any misuse of state power, including the inappropriate use of animals in law enforcement activities, affirming their stance in support of a society built on principles of harmony and mutual respect.

Published on: July 06, 2024 08:29 (EAT)
US President Joe Biden looks down as he participates in the first presidential debate of the 2024 elections with former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at CNN's studios in Atlanta, Georgia, on June 27, 2024. (Photo by ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS / AFP)
Joe Biden vowed Friday to stay in the White House race and blamed his dismal debate performance on ""feeling terrible"" due to a cold, as he sought to save his reelection campaign with a make-or-break TV interview.
As rebellion brews among some nervous Democratic voters, lawmakers and donors, the one-to-one with the ABC network was hyped as the most consequential of the 81-year-old's long career.
""I was sick, I was feeling terrible... We were trying to figure out what's wrong,"" the president said in an excerpt of his first TV interview since the debate with Donald Trump.
""They did a test to see whether or not I had some infection, you know, a virus. I didn't. I just had a really bad cold.""
Biden sounded raspy and gave meandering answers in the clip, which appeared unlikely to reassure Democrats.
The Trump campaign offered a lightning-quick mocking reaction, posting on X that ""Biden sounds great!""
The sit-down -- which was due to be aired in full later Friday, came after Biden's debate in Atlanta triggered panic within his party and calls for him to pull out of the race.
The Biden campaign has pushed back hard on any suggestion he may withdraw and, just hours before the ABC interview, released an aggressive campaign travel schedule for the rest of July.
Appearing at a campaign rally in Madison, Wisconsin, the president delivered an energetic stump speech, unequivocally declaring, ""I'm staying in the race. I'll beat Donald Trump.""
As supporters cheered, he went on the attack against his rival.
- Polls tip toward Trump -
""Let's focus on what really matters,"" Biden said, reading from teleprompters. ""We're running against the biggest liar and the biggest threat... to our democracy in American history -- that's not hyperbole.""
Post-debate polls have shown a widening deficit in Trump's favor, and at least three Democrats in Congress have called on Biden to step aside, as have several major newspapers and a raft of Democratic-supporting political commentators.
Wealthy Disney heiress and Democratic supporter Abigail Disney, told CNBC she plans to withhold donations to the party until Biden drops out, saying bluntly that ""if Biden does not step down the Democrats will lose"" in November.
""This is realism, not disrespect,"" she said.
Senate Intelligence Committee chariman Mark Warner has approached fellow Democrats to organize talks on Monday on Biden's path forward, multiple US media outlets reported.
House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries was convening his own meeting -- a video call with senior Democrats -- on Sunday, according to NBC News.
Former US House speaker Nancy Pelosi, one of the most influential Democratic voices, has deemed it ""essential"" he do more major interviews to prove himself.
The White House has announced he will hold a press conference during the NATO summit in Washington next Thursday, but has not revealed any details on its format or length.
Biden's travel plans include Pennsylvania this weekend, then the NATO meeting, and back on the campaign trail with a swing through the American Southwest.
The president will ""engage in frequent off-the-cuff moments over the course of the month, as he has consistently throughout this campaign,"" his team said, seeking to emphasize his folksy charm.
Trump has meanwhile dared Biden to another debate, or an ""all-on discussion,"" saying he was ready ""anytime, anywhere, any place.""
With speculation swirling over a potential switch in the Democratic ticket, Kamala Harris, the nation's first female vice president, has suddenly been in the spotlight.
The 59-year-old former prosecutor has offered unwavering support for Biden in public but is standing by as a leading alternative if he steps aside.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/polls-open-in-iran-for-presidential-election-n344835,"Polls open in Iran for presidential election
Polls in Iran opened on Friday for a presidential election following the death of ultraconservative president Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month.
Around 61 million Iranians are eligible to vote in the polls where reformist Masoud Pezeshkian, 69, hopes for a breakthrough win against a divided conservative camp.
The Guardian Council, which vets candidates, allowed him to run against a field of conservatives now dominated by parliamentary speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf and former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili.
Also left in contention is cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi after two ultraconservatives dropped out -- Tehran major Alireza Zakani and Raisi's former vice president Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi.
""We start the elections"" for the country's 14th presidential ballot, Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi said in a televised address.
Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei cast his ballot shortly after the polls opened and urged Iranians to vote.
""Election day is a day of joy and happiness for us Iranians,"" he said in a televised speech where he also called for a high turnout.
""We encourage our dear people to take the issue of voting seriously and participate,"" he said.
The election in sanctions-hit Iran comes at a time of high regional tensions between the Islamic republic and its arch-foes Israel and the United States as the Gaza war rages on.
Polls opened at 8:00 am (0430 GMT) in 58,640 stations across the country, mostly in schools and mosques.
Polling stations will be open for 10 hours, though authorities could extend voting time as in previous elections.
Early projections of the results are expected by Saturday morning and official results by Sunday.
If no candidate wins 50 percent of the vote, a second round will be held on July 5, for only the second time in Iranian electoral history after the 2005 vote went to a runoff.
The candidacy of Pezeshkian, until recently a relative unknown, has revived cautious hopes for Iran's reformist wing after years of dominance by the conservative and ultraconservative camps.
Iran's last reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, praised him as ""honest, fair and caring"".
Khatami, who served from 1997 to 2005, had also endorsed the moderate Hassan Rouhani, who won the presidency and sealed Iran's nuclear deal in 2015 with Western powers before it was derailed three years later.
The Iranian opposition, particularly in the diaspora, has called for a boycott of the vote.
Ultimate political power in Iran is held by Khamenei, the supreme leader.
Khamenei insisted this week that ""the most qualified candidate"" must be ""the one who truly believes in the principles of the Islamic Revolution"" of 1979 that overthrew the US-backed monarchy.
The next president, he said, must allow Iran ""to move forward without being dependent on foreign countries"".
However, Khamenei also said that Iran should not ""cut its relations with the world"".
During campaign debates, Jalili criticised the moderates for having signed the 2015 nuclear accord which promised Iran sanctions relief in return for curbs on the programme.
Jalili said the deal, which the United States withdrew from in 2018 under then-president Donald Trump, ""did not benefit Iran at all"".
Pezeshkian has urged efforts to salvage the agreement and lift crippling sanctions on the Iranian economy.
""Are we supposed to be eternally hostile to America, or do we aspire to resolve our problems with this country?"" he asked.
The contentious issue of the compulsory head covering for women also emerged during the campaign, almost two years since a vast protest movement swept the country after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, 22.
An Iranian Kurd, Amini had been arrested for an alleged violation of the country's strict dress code for women.
In the televised debates, all candidates distanced themselves from the sometimes heavy-handed police arrests of women refusing to wear the hijab head covering in public.
Pourmohammadi, the only clerical candidate, said that ""under no circumstances should we treat Iranian women with such cruelty.""

https://www.citizen.digital/news/be-a-man-embrace-national-dialogue-cs-kuria-urges-kalonzo-n345633,"‘Be a man, embrace national dialogue’: CS Kuria urges Kalonzo
Public Service Cabinet Secretary Moses Kuria has urged Wiper
leader Kalonzo Musyoka to embrace President William Ruto's calls for national
dialogue to address concerns raised by Kenyans amidst the anti-government
demonstrations.
Speaking on Citizen TV's ‘JKLive’ show on
Wednesday night, Kuria remarked that Kalonzo has a history of frequently
changing his political stance, further emphasizing that the former Vice
President needs to take a firm position and fully commit to the proposed talks.
Kuria added that he would personally seek out Kalonzo and
Former Defence Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa on Thursday in a bid to
convince them join the national dialogue bandwagon.
“Tomorrow I will place a call to my good friend Eugene Wamalwa
and Kalonzo Musyoka; particularly Kalonzo. He is such a senior leader in this
country for him to say I don’t want dialogue; why?” Kuria posed.
“This guy he is normally in Rock City in Ukambani with people
from his community dialoguing. He is always on Maanzioni dialoguing. I want to
call him and tell him not to lose this moment. That is a big problem with my
friend Kalonzo. He goes one way and then the other. Can’t we just be principled
because you are convinced. Don’t keep on doing calculations. Be a man for once;
come and do it because you are convinced.”
Kuria’s sentiments came after Wiper, in a statement to
newsrooms on Wednesday, took issue with
President Ruto’s calls to engage the youth saying the current regime is
ignorant of the message by Gen Zs which is ‘action now.’
The opposition-affiliated party thus appealed to President
Ruto to swiftly address concerns raised by Kenyan youth during the recent
protests rather than pushing to have a meeting with their so-called
representatives.
“In terms of the Gen Z revolution, it appears that Ruto lacks
an understanding of public sentiment. Generation Z does not wish to engage in
dialogue. They want action, and Wiper agrees,” said the party in the statement
after a National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting.
The party said the challenges presently plaguing the country
are beyond dialogue, and require only implementation.
It also cited the National Dialogue Committee (NADCO) formed
last year to address issues surrounding Finance Bill 2023, underscoring that
despite the committee recommending certain findings, the whole process was
inconsequential to the needs of Kenyans at the time.
In the same way, Wiper said the solution would be to implement
the needs of Gen Zs to the latter, among them posting of medical interns,
dissolving Parliament, and sacking corrupt government officials.
“The current situation in Kenya could have been avoided if the
regime had addressed rising living costs and implemented the National Dialogue
Committee findings. You don't need dialogue. Dialogue is not required to assess
public debt because the Auditor General's Office has the same role,” the
statement noted.
“The attempt to usurp the Constitution by forming a task force
on the subject is equally telling. You do not need dialogue to post medical
interns or to sack corrupt government officials.”

A spot check by Citizen Digital showed that areas in CBD were calm as majority of the businesses remained closed.
There was normal flow of traffic along major highways including Waiyaki Way, Mombasa Road, Thika Road.
A contingent of security officers cordoned roads leading to State House, forcing motorists to use alternative routes.
In Migori town, the demonstrations began in the morning as transport was paralysed and businesses closed.
Protestors took to the streets and barricaded the road with stones and singing chants against the Kenya Kwanza government.
According to posters shared online, all Kenyans were invited to join the demonstrations to protest against budgeted corruption and call for the removal of the current regime.
In Kisumu, activist Boniface Akach confirmed that protestors would march to the streets to pay tribute to those killed by the police. He noted that they would converge at the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Sportsground.
During a roundtable discussions with the media, President William Ruto alleged that the police would protect peaceful protestors but at the same time fight against 'criminals' who camouflage as Gen Zs to cause chaos. He also pointed out that the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) would be used as a last resort if the protests turned into mayhem.
""The KDF will not be in the streets. They only come as a last resort. If the demonstrations will be peaceful I promise you the police will be there to protect the demonstrators,"" Ruto said.

Football defending
champions Vihiga Boys’ team have bowed out of the Vihiga County Secondary
School football games after a poor outing in the group stage this year.
Despite holding
Ebwali Boys to a barren draw in the Thursday group matches, Vihiga could not
proceed to the semis especially after Ebwali thrashed Chavakali High 3-0 as Senende Boys
to held Vihiga to a 2-2 stalemate ending Vihiga’s dream of defending their
title.
Ebwali coach
Francis Muhambe who spoke after the game played at Mumboha playground said the
ability of his players to contain Chavakali wingers who had posed a great
danger to his defense significantly earned him the much desired victory.
Their victory will
see the Luanda-based team now take on Emusire Boys from Emuhaya this Friday in
the semis at Mumboha.
“Chavakali had very
sharp wingers, had we not contained them under the first 25 minutes of play, we
would now be out of this competitions,” Muhambe said.
Austine Odongo
was on target before the halftime before Kevin Saka made it two for Ebwali
after the resumption of the second half. Ebwali skipper Abu Swaleh scored the
third goal to seal the win.
However, Muhambe
dismissed his critics who claim that Ebwali is playing boring football,
maintaining all he wants is victory.
“Entertainment in
football is a foreign thing. The very fans who would want you to entertain them
on the pitch will mock you if you fail to score. You would rather look for a
shortcut to win a game than focus on ball possession and lose,” he stated.
On the Other
hand, Chavakali tactician Hillary Muleri whose team has qualified to semis has
assured fans of quality football as they now face Shamakhokho on Friday.
“Better lose with
good football than win with bad football. If we manage to get to the regionals
we will address the challenge of our porous defense then we are good to go. If
we meet Ebwali again we will beat them. Chavakali do nott fear anybody, only
that today they were under pressure to proceed to the semis and they managed to
beat us,” Muleri said.
Ebwali went on
top of pool B with 10 points after beating Ebusiloli 3-0, Senende 4-0 and
Chavakali 3-0 before Vihiga held them to a barren draw.
Chavakali
qualified for Semifinals after a 3-2 win against Vihiga Boys, beat Ebusiloli
and Senende 2-0 to accumulate nine points.
Emusire Boys from
Emuhaya will battle it out against Luanda’s Ebwali at Mumboha in the semifinals
while Chavakali from Sabatia play Shamakhokho from Hamisi at Es’saba to get Vihiga’s

https://www.citizen.digital/news/john-chebochok-threatens-to-sue-bbc-demands-ksh100m-in-damages-over-expose-n345224,"John Chebochok threatens to sue BBC, demands Ksh.100M in damages over exposé
Newly elected Director of Toror Tea Factory,
John Chebochok, has issued a demand letter to the British Broadcasting
Corporation (BBC) demanding a Ksh.100 million defamation settlement over their
documentary titled ‘Sex for work: The True Cost of Our Tea.’
In the 2023 expose, Chebochok was accused of allegedly
preying on female workers at a James Finlay Limited factory in Kericho in exchange
for employment.
Chebochok, through his lawyer Danstan Omari, now
says the allegations from the documentary were outrageous and a well-calculated
scheme merely meant to defame his reputation.
He also pointed out that the claims were orchestrated
by his competitors both in politics as well as the tea sector who allegedly sought
to buy out Finlays from the factory.
""Politicians who are against our
client’s political bid appeared to have been angered that he implemented
mechanization at Finlay and as a result, some of their voters lost jobs and the
said competitors fought the said process unsuccessfully,"" the letter read
in part.
Omari also questioned why the documentary,
which went viral, was aired without his client's input. Currently, the
documentary has over 2.8 million views on YouTube.
Further, the lawyer pointed out that no
alleged victim in the video made a complaint to the police or any investigating
authority.
""The malicious broadcast of your
documentary has caused our client significant emotional, psychological and
unwarranted distress and stigma. Several entities have since used your
documentary to recklessly tarnish our client’s name,"" he said.
""They intend to use the contents of the
documentary to subvert the will of the people to democratically elect him from
amongst a group of other contestants.""
Omari hence demanded that the BBC should
offer a full publication of an apology and retract the said documentary from
their channel.
Further, he demanded that the media house desists from publishing any further defamatory statements or documentaries about Chebochok.
""Take notice that should you fail to make good the demands of our client within the next 3 working days, we have instructions to seek other legal remedies to protect the image of our client, including but not limited to instituting a suit against you at your cost,"" Omari added.
The letter comes amid calls by international
tea suppliers for Chebochok to be removed as Toror Tea Factory director.
Both Finlays and Lipton Teas and
Infusions have since ceased purchasing tea from Toror Factory and urged other stakeholders to
follow suit until Chebochok is removed as director.
The Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA) also appealed
to stakeholders to accord them an opportunity to address the concerns raised by
working with relevant authorities to resolve the issues.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/eyebrows-raised-over-bill-granting-iebc-powers-to-declare-vehicles-as-polling-stations-n345499,"Eyebrows raised over Bill granting IEBC powers to declare vehicles as polling stations
This raised questions over the credibility and transparency of the elections if the commission sought to select vehicles as a polling station. Further, it is not clear whether the vehicle or vessel used will remain stationary three months to the elections.
The conversation came at a time when President William Ruto assented the IEBC (Amendment) Bill 2024 into law on Tuesday morning, with many people claiming that the clause is contained in the bill.
This included Jubilee party Secretary-General Jeremiah Kioni who criticised the bill and called for the clause to be repealed before the bill is assented. He read malice into the clause, claiming that it presented an opportunity for the current regime to rig the 2027 elections.
""I don't thing Kenyans are fools to allow this kind of an amendment to pass. Even as he signs, this is one of the areas that requires to be sent back to parliament for deletion. This is a clear way of trying to rig elections and we know that Ruto is permanently looking for ways of bringing himself into power,"" Kioni stated.
Nairobi Senator Edwin Sifuna cleared the air following speculations over the bill and confirmed that the clause is contained in the Elections (Amendment) Bill, 2024.
Elections (Amendment) Bill vs IEBC (Amendment) Bill
The IEBC (Amendment) Bill, 2024 paves the way for the appointment of new IEBC commissioners and thus facilitate the reconstitution of the electoral agency. Further, it introduces a mandatory review of the conduct of general elections whereby a comprehensive report will be published within eighteen months after elections.
On the other hand, the Elections (Amendment) Bill, 2024, consists of changes made around the electoral process.
Clause 38A of the bill dictates that the Commission has the powers to designate a vehicle or vessel as a polling station for each electoral area and officially gazette them through electronic and print media, specifying the polling stations established for each area at least three months before any election date.
""No election shall be conducted in a place other than a place gazetted as a polling station under the subsection (above),"" reads part of the bill.
The bill is sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Aaron Cheruiyot and his Minority counterpart Stewart Madzayo. It is currently in the public participation stage before returning to Senate for its Second and Third Reading.
In the public participation phase, Kenyans can submit their comments which will be considered during the Second Reading stage whereby the senators will be required to vote either for or against the amended bill.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/explainer-what-happens-next-after-ruto-withdraws-the-finance-bill-n344736,"Explainer: What happens next after Ruto withdraws the Finance Bill?
Ruto conceded to Kenyans' will during a press briefing and agreed to withdraw the bill in its entirety, confirming a unanimous agreement among the lawmakers present at State House.
Ruto's remarks sparked debate about whether the president can withdraw the bill and the fallout, especially given that parliament went on recess on Wednesday and will resume regular sittings on Tuesday, July 23.
Azimio MPs also chastised Ruto's remarks, questioning what would happen to the bill given that the MPs will return in a month, after the 14-day period has expired.
“Ati Withdrawn and Sent Back To Parliament?! Wakenya Mnabwebwa Mafala Kweli. Read For Yourselves The Simple & Clear Wording Of Article 115. Meantime, National Assembly Went On Recess This Morning, Till 23rd July,” Amollo said.
What the law says
According to Article 115 of the Constitution, the president has two options 14 days after receiving the bill: sign it into law or refer it back to Parliament for amendments.
If the head of state returns the bill to Parliament, MPs must either amend it after adopting the president's recommendations or pass it again without amendments. This should be done with a two-thirds majority in the National Assembly.
What happens if the President declines to sign a bill?
Clause 6 of the Constitution states that if the president refuses to sign the bill and fails to return it to Parliament within 14 days, the bill will be considered law.
This means that Ruto must write a letter to parliament within 14 days recommending that the bill be rejected in its entirety; otherwise, the bill will become law.
What a Constitutional lawyer says
Constitutional lawyer Charles Kanjama confirmed to Citizen Digital that Ruto's recommendation must be presented to Parliament and passed with a two-thirds majority for the entire bill to be withdrawn.
“If the president takes the bill back to parliament and his recommendation is to reject the bill what we call veto power, unless you can get a two-thirds majority, then the veto expires,” he said.
“He has three options; assent the bill, return to parliament with reservations or do nothing. If he does nothing within 14 days, then it becomes law.”

In a statement, KMA Secretary General Dr. Diana Marion said that the task force's mandate is already being undertaken by other constitutional bodies.
Some of the bodies are the Kenya Health Human Resource Advisory Council (KHHRAC) and the Kenya Health Professions Oversight Authority (KHPOA).
According to KMA, KHHRAC is charged with reviewing policies and establishing standards for posting interns, inter county transfers of healthcare professions, welfare, schemes, and maintaining a master register.
At the same time, KHPOA maintains a duplicate register for all health professionals, promotes and regulates inter-professional liaison, resolves complaints from patients, arbitrates disputes besides ensuring that standards for health practitioners are upheld.
The task force was recommended following the Return to Work formula after the 56-day doctors' strike.
KMA however pushed for the establishment of a constitutional Health Service Commission (HSC) which will manage the Human Resources for Health function centrally.
Some of the proposed functions include the setting up of standards for training, code of conduct, recruitment and remuneration and the registration of health workers.
It will also oversee recruitment, deployment and rationalize remuneration and terms of service for health workers in the country.
President William Ruto named the 20-member taskforce on July 6.
He appointed Khama Rogo as the chairperson and Judith Guserwa the vice Chairperson of the task force.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/govt-vows-to-address-cases-of-abduction-arbitrary-arrests-during-protests-n345532,"Gov’t vows to address cases of abduction, arbitrary arrests during protests
The government has committed to take action against any
security personnel involved in abductions and arbitrary arrests during the anti-Finance
Bill 2024 and anti-government protests.
Interior Cabinet Secretary Prof Kithure Kindiki in a
statement on Tuesday reiterated his recent sentiments that those found culpable
of the alleged disappearances and any other unlawful detentions would face the
full force of the law.
Even though Kindiki did not outline any specific cases, he
said the government was aware of certain claims and that investigative
agencies had since launched a probe into the matter.
“The Government has noted with concern claims of abductions
and enforced disappearances allegedly perpetrated by security personnel,” said
Kindiki.
“Independent Constitutional and statutory agencies will
investigate and prosecute any person or official who may be implicated with
violating the Constitution by perpetrating confinement of any person outside
the law.”
The CS underscored that security agencies had a duty to
adhere to the rule of law while making arrests and detention so as to ensure
they do not interfere with the rights of Kenyan citizens.
“All persons within the territory of Kenya are protected
from unlawful or arbitrary arrests, abductions, enforced disappearances or any
other illegal method of confining suspected criminals for purposes of
investigations for prosecution or for whatever purpose whatsoever,” he stated.
“The Government reiterates its duty to respect and ensure
the protection of all constitutionally guaranteed rights and will not condone
any violation whether perpetuated by security personnel or by public or private
persons.”
On matters of police officers using excessive force on
demonstrators which led to loss of lives and injuries during the protests, Prof
Kindiki said that appropriate action would be taken against any security
officer who acted outside the law.
He likewise said that a probe was underway to nab all
violators of the law, especially the criminals who reportedly infiltrated the
peaceful protests started by the Gen Zs to cause mayhem and destroy property.
“As the conversation on taxation and other priority national
issues commence, the process of accountability for serious crimes that resulted
in loss of life, destruction of property and breach of the peace is
simultaneously underway,” he said.
“To avoid repeat behaviour of impunity, the organisers,
planners and financiers of the crimes that were committed against the people of
Kenya in the pretext of peaceful demonstrations will be prosecuted once the
ongoing investigations are completed. In the same vein, any infractions or
excesses by law enforcement officers will be investigated and appropriate
action taken on those found culpable.”
Last week, Kindiki pledged to prevent any planned crime or destruction as a result of the ongoing anti-government protests across the
country saying that some criminals posing as protestors infiltrated peaceful
protests in order to loot, destroy property, and cause public unrest.
He issued a stern warning to the perpetrators, stating that
security agencies would prevent such incidents at any cost, further claiming
that the protests were politically motivated and that the government would
address the issue.
During a recent interview with Citizen TV’s The Explainer Show on Thursday, Kindiki dismissed claims of abductions and defended some of the acts by police officers to don civilian outfits.

https://www.citizen.digital/wananchi-reporting/how-government-austerity-measures-could-have-negative-impact-on-wananchi-n345647,"How Government austerity measures could have negative impact on Wananchi
Some of the measures he announced include the dissolution of 47 State Corporations that have overlapping mandates, the stop in the funding of the offices of the First Lady, the Second Lady, and the office of the Spouse of the Prime Cabinet Secretary; the reduction of the number of advisers in the government by 50 per cent, scrapping of budgetary provisions for confidential budgets in various Executive offices among other measures.
The President also announced the establishment of a Task force to do a forensic audit on public debt.
However the establishment of the Task force has now been temporarily suspended by the high court.
While the austerity measures are meant to reduce public expenditure, questions have been raised about what the consequent effect will be on wananchi.
During a Citizen Digital X Space held on Tuesday on austerity measures and their effect, Cuba Houghton, a programmes support and communications officer with the International Budget Partnership (IBP) warned, that while there may be positive effects in the long-run, there may be negative effects felt by wananchi in the short-term.
“There is a human side to austerity measures and in the short term, there are several adverse effects that can be outcomes of austerity. This goes beyond Kenya,” he said.
“If you look at how structural adjustment programs have been implemented and the impacts, in other countries you can also see that it's been negative.”
Houghton went on to give the example of El Salvador.
“As part of their structural adjustment program, they had to privatize some of their state corporations. And the one that they ended up privatizing, for example, was the energy distribution. So for us, it would be Kenya Power. What happened is that eventually, that raised money for the government because of the privatization, so it was essentially sold off. However, there was no service delivery benefit. The services didn't improve. And in fact, what happened is that the cost of services, especially for the poor and vulnerable, went up because the companies spiked the prices. And then the government had to end up spending money on subsidizing the cost of electricity because, these companies hiked the prices. So in order to make it more affordable, the government had to spend more, you know.”
Houghton went ahead to give examples how structural adjustment programmes also had reverse effects in other countries, including in the Philippines, Zimbabwe, and Mexico, where the programs resulted in a decrease in health and education spending over time.
“There was one year in Mexico that spending on education fell by 40 percent. So it's important to consider the potential negative effects. One of the most intense austerity programs we've seen is happening in Argentina where the new president and administration have decided to implement a series of deep reforms, because Argentina's economy has been struggling. Among those is the devaluation of its currency by more than 50%. And what that's done is raise the cost of living and food and gas by more than double.”
In conclusion, Houghton said that in the long term, there are benefits of expenditure rationalization, but it's important to be careful about how it is done.
“Are we going to sacrifice certain specific social services in pursuit of that vision? Are we going to instead cut down on wasteful expenditure and the expenditure that we see overlapped in the budget.”

https://www.citizen.digital/opinion-blogs/misplaced-blame-dp-gachaguas-criticism-of-nis-director-noordin-haji-n344794,"Misplaced blame: DP Gachagua's criticism of NIS director Noordin Haji
In recent political discourse, Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua's comments regarding NIS Director Noordin Haji have sparked significant controversy and debate. Gachagua's assertion that Haji is incompetent and should be held responsible for failing to inform President William Ruto about the unpopularity of the 2024/2025 Finance Bill among the citizens is not only misguided but also overlooks the broader responsibilities and dynamics within the government.
To begin with, the National Intelligence Service (NIS) and its director have a mandate that extends beyond merely gauging public opinion on specific legislative measures. The primary role of the NIS is to ensure national security by providing intelligence on threats both internal and external.
While understanding public sentiment is undoubtedly a component of their intelligence gathering, it is not their primary function to advise on the popularity of fiscal policies. Blaming Haji for not predicting the public's reaction to a finance bill diverts attention from the more pertinent issue of governmental accountability and responsiveness.
Gachagua was, however, right on one point: the unpopularity of the 2024/2025 Finance Bill is a symptom of a deeper disconnect between the government and the electorate. The bill's content and its reception reflect the broader economic realities and public sentiments.
Suppose the finance bill has faced significant backlash. In that case, it is a clear indication that the legislative process did not sufficiently incorporate public consultation or adequately address the economic hardships faced by ordinary Kenyans. The elected representatives, including the President and his Deputy, are responsible for ensuring that policies resonate with the needs and aspirations of the populace.
Moreover, Gachagua's attempt to single out Haji shifts focus away from the collective responsibility of the Cabinet and the broader political leadership. Effective governance relies on a cohesive strategy where intelligence inputs are considered alongside economic data, public consultations, and expert analysis.
The Finance Bill, being a crucial element of economic policy, should have undergone rigorous scrutiny and debate within the government before being presented to the public. This process involves multiple stakeholders, and attributing the bill's failure to one individual oversimplifies the complexities of policy formulation and implementation.
Furthermore, the Deputy President's remarks can have far-reaching implications on the morale and functioning of the NIS. Publicly undermining the competence of the intelligence chief could erode trust and confidence within the service, potentially hampering its effectiveness.
The political leadership must maintain a constructive relationship with intelligence agencies, ensuring that criticisms and feedback are channelled through appropriate and respectful avenues.
In addressing the Finance Bill's unpopularity, a more constructive approach would involve a thorough review of the bill, incorporating feedback from various sectors, and engaging in open dialogue with the public.
The government must demonstrate a willingness to listen and adapt policies to reflect the realities its citizens face. This approach not only fosters trust but also enhances the legitimacy and acceptance of government initiatives.
Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua's statement blaming NIS Director Noordin Haji for the unpopularity of the 2024/2025 Finance Bill is misplaced. The responsibility for ensuring that government policies align with public sentiment rests with the entire political leadership, not just the intelligence service. The government must adopt a more holistic and inclusive approach to policy-making, one that prioritizes the voices and needs of the Kenyan people.

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/dortmund-turns-orange-as-dutch-fans-stream-across-the-border-n345608,"Dortmund turns orange as Dutch fans stream across the border
Netherlands supporters turned Dortmund into a sea of orange on
Wednesday in the build-up to the European Championship semi-final with England
with an estimated 70,000 crossing the border to cheer on their team and vastly
outnumbering rival fans.
Most do not have match tickets but made the journey to watch the
game in one of the city's two fan parks – causing one to put the ""full
house"" signs up seven hours before kick off.
No more supporters were being allowed into the Friedenplatz fan
park from 1400 local time because it was already too full, Dortmund police said.
Thousands were jammed into the city centre, on trams on the
city's underground and outside their team's hotel near the BVB Stadion where
the match kicks off at 2100 (1900 GMT).
Supporters were due to begin the ‘Oranje fan walk’ some five
hours before kick off, walking several kilometres from the city to the stadium.
The walk has been made famous by social media video of fans
hopping from one direction to the other in unison to the dance anthem ‘Links
Rechts’ -- which translates to left, right -- by Dutch artist Snollebollekes.
Traffic at entry points into Germany was backed up, the Dutch
automobile association ANWB said, as German police carried out checks.
At 1230, there was a traffic jam of about 13km on the A12
motorway which runs from The Hague to the border, causing a delay of about an
hour, it added. Dortmund is less than 100km from the Dutch border.
The Netherlands team were due to fly back to their base at
Wolfsburg after the match, irrespective of whether they win or lose, the Dutch
FA said.
They had attempted to travel to Dortmund on Tuesday by train but
plans were cancelled after the route was blocked. German television reported
later that a train had struck an animal on the tracks causing delays.
The Dutch squad arrived at their Dortmund base some three hours later
than planned on Tuesday evening.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/jill-biden-a-first-lady-in-the-trenches-n345020,"Jill Biden: A first lady in the trenches
""I think she is as influential as pundits are claiming and her opinion likely matters more to him than anyone else's,"" said Tammy Vigil, a professor of communications at Boston University.
""Without her support, it would be impossible for him to continue in the race.""
The 73-year-old community college professor was making headlines of her own on Monday, as Vogue unveiled the cover of its August issue -- with the first lady looking seraphic in a long white tuxedo gown by Ralph Lauren.
The picture and the article date from April, long before President Joe Biden struggled to make himself understood during a halting, unfocused performance at a CNN debate against Republican rival Donald Trump.
But in a note introducing the article, the magazine's editors revealed they'd had a telephone conversation with the first lady shortly after the debate, as calls mounted for her 81-year-old husband to withdraw his candidacy.
- 'The right person' -
She told Vogue the Biden family ""will not let those 90 minutes define the four years he's been president.""
The woman who has shared her last 47 years with the Democratic leader also told a weekend meeting of donors: ""Joe isn't just the right person for the job. He's the only person for the job.""
On Thursday, after the debate, Jill Biden was shown taking her husband's arm to help him down a few steps in the CNN studio.
The following day, she was there again in a dress that read ""vote,"" as a much more energetic Joe Biden headlined a rally in North Carolina.
Before they married in 1977, Joe Biden had been turned into a widower by a horrific car crash five years earlier that had claimed the lives of his first wife and their infant daughter. His two boys, Beau and Hunter, survived.
The family was revisited by tragedy years later as Beau, a cherished son at the start of what looked like a promising political career of his own, died of cancer.
Adding to the family's difficulties, Hunter struggled for years with a crack addiction.
The first lady is now the center of gravity of the troubled but burgeoning clan, bolstered with the birth of Jill and Joe's daughter Ashley a few years after their wedding -- and eventually the arrival of their grandchildren.
Without her support, the Democrat would not have embarked on his quest for a second term.
When she arrived at the White House, she continued to teach English at a college near Washington, unheard of for a president's wife.
- Decorations and campaigning -
Meanwhile, she assumed the traditional role of first lady -- in charge of Christmas decorations and gala dinner menus, as well as promoting pet causes -- in her case, literacy.
Amid the shaky reelection campaign, Jill Biden could well encourage an outpouring of sympathy with her passionate advocacy for the president since his calamitous showdown with Trump -- but also risks alienating a segment of public opinion by doing so.
""A contemporary US first lady is supposed to be the 'not-so-secret weapon' that helps her husband by attesting to his character and by helping raise funds, et cetera. Because of that, Jill Biden is expected to participate in the campaign,"" said Vigil.
""However, there are also unstated limits to that activity that are hard to figure out until a particular line is crossed. If she is too vigorous in her support and defense of her husband, people will complain.""
The first lady has become a prime target on social media since the debate, with Trump supporters painting her as an unscrupulous manipulator.
""What Jill Biden and the Biden campaign did to Joe Biden tonight -- rolling him out on stage to engage in a battle of wits while unarmed -- is elder abuse, plain and simple,"" Wyoming Republican Harriet Hageman posted on X after the debate.

Embakasi East Member of Parliament Babu Owino
has chided President William Ruto over his failure to take accountability for
the death of Kenyan youth during the recent wave of anti-government protests.
Mr.
Owino, who spoke on Friday during the burial of a Gen Z protester Rex Kanyeki
Masai in Machakos County, said President Ruto had failed Kenyans as a leader
and he ought to step down.
The
outspoken MP chastised the Head of State over the deaths of innocent
protesters, saying that he should have attended the burial to mourn Rex instead
of holding an engagement forum on X Spaces.
He
opined that Ruto’s adamancy and unpopular leadership decision that has recently
pitted him against the majority of Kenyans, especially the Gen Zs, will
ultimately lead to his political downfall.
“If
Ruto were a President or a leader, he would be here today to comfort the family
of Rex, but he is not. If he were a President, he would be here today to pay
his last respects. He would take responsibility for every life that has been
lost unnecessarily in this country during this struggle, but he is not,” stated
Mr. Owino.
“Instead
of pursuing your selfish political ambition on X Space, you should have come
here and let us have a conversation by the grave of Rex. We want to converse
with you on the graveside not on X Space.”
He
added: “I can promise you that the Gen Zs you are seeing here today and in this
country, the millennials and the Kenyan youths will send you into political
oblivion, which is the entombment of the unworthy into their own dust of
nothingness. We want you to come from being a President into being a resident.”
According
to the legislator, Ruto’s administration has continuously frustrated Kenyans
with the high cost of living characterized by increased taxes and corruption scandals
such as the fake fertiliser saga.
“Because
he is not a leader, he is a dealer. He is dealing with our lives and killing
our children and is on a mission and not on a vision. A vision to kill the
young people, to increase the high cost of medication and a vision to destroy
the country for the worst,” he said.
“Rex
and other Gen Zs died fighting to liberate this nation because the cost of
education is high, no medicines in hospitals, and our children and farmers are
going without food because you are selling fake fertilisers to our farmers.”
Also
present at the burial were Azimio la Umoja One Kenya coalition principals who
accused the President of siding with what they termed as injustice and
curtailing constitutional rights by congratulating the police even though their
excesses were obvious.
“Wewe
bwana Ruto huwezi sema you have the table of dialogue when you have unleashed
the military against our youth, hawa vijana walienda wakiwa na simu na maji…Rex
walikuwa na simu na maji…two things…hii maji sio risasi,” DAP-K party leader
Eugene Wamalwa said.
Wiper
Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka added: “Si halali kabisa kumpiga Mkenya aliyejifunika
bendera ya Kenya…bendera ya Kenya is sacrosanct…kijana akauawa akawa wa kwanza
kwa mauaji 41.”
The
29-year-old Rex, who was the first victim of the Gen Z-led demonstrations, was
shot by a plainclothes police officer on June 18, 2024 at about 7pm along the
streets of Nairobi during the anti-Finance Bill protests.
CCTV
footage showed the officer firing not one, not two, but multiple live bullets
believed to have ended Rex’s life.
The family
of Rex is now demanding justice for a young man who lost his life during
peaceful protests.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/keir-starmer-who-is-the-uks-new-prime-minister-and-what-has-he-promised-n345265,"Keir Starmer: Who is the UK's new Prime Minister and what has he promised?
Keir Starmer enters power with one of the longest
lists of problems ever to face an incoming prime minister and few resources to
deal with them - a situation that could curtail any ""honeymoon
period"" offered by the British people.
It is a situation not lost on the 61-year-old
Labour leader and former lawyer, who spent much of the election campaign
listening to voters' concerns about healthcare, education, and the cost of
living, but promising only to try to make the lives of British voters a little
better - over time.
""I'm not going to stand here and say
there's some magic wand that I can wave the day after the election and find
money that isn't there,"" he said in a head-to-head debate with his
predecessor Rishi Sunak before the election. ""Huge damage has been done to
our economy. It is going to take time.""
Despite being on course for a massive
majority in the parliamentary election, many voters are disenchanted with
politicians after years of what became an increasingly chaotic and
scandal-ridden Conservative government and what was an often divided Labour
opposition, dogged antisemitism accusations.
Hailing his party's victory at a speech to
supporters, Starmer said on Friday: ""We did it. Change begins now, and it
feels good. I have to be honest.""
""Today, we start the next chapter, begin
the work of change, the mission of national renewal and start to rebuild our
country.""
Starmer says he leads a changed Labour Party,
having instilled a sense of discipline after it all but tore itself apart
during the Brexit years under his predecessor, veteran left-winger Jeremy
Corbyn.
That message dominated the six-week campaign,
with no really new policy offerings beyond those which had
been, according to Labour, fully funded and costed. He has tried not to raise
hopes for swift change too high, putting wealth creation and political and economic
stability at the heart of his pitch to voters.
The strategy is very much a product of
Starmer, who turned to politics in his 50s in a career that has been marked by
a cautious and methodical approach, relying on competence and pragmatism rather than being
driven by an overriding ideology.
Named after the founder of the Labour Party,
Keir Hardie, Starmer was brought up in a left-wing household. As a barrister,
he often defended underdogs and worked to get people off death row around the
world.
He became a Labour lawmaker in 2015, a year
after he received a knighthood for his services to law and criminal justice and
was appointed Labour leader in 2020 following the party's worst election
showing since 1935.
He implemented a plan to turn the party
around and guide its priorities, with one person who worked with Starmer
saying: ""He thinks about the best way to take people with him.""
This approach has led to the charge that he
is dull. He has drawn negative comparisons with Tony Blair, who led the party
to victory with a landslide majority in 1997.
""I think he's got a good heart but he's
got no charisma. And people do buy charisma. That's how Tony Blair got
in,"" said Valerie Palmer, 80, a voter in the seaside town of
Clacton-on-Sea.
Unwilling to make promises that could not be
costed, his approach has also prompted critics to say the party's manifesto
offered only a partial view of what Labour would do in government - something the
Conservatives tried to capitalise on by saying Starmer would raise taxes.
Starmer denied this, saying he would not
raise income tax rates, employees' national insurance contributions,
value-added tax or corporation tax.
Some businesses say they look forward to a period
of calm after 14 years of turbulent Conservative government, marked by
Britain's vote to leave the European Union in 2016 and the cost of living
crisis that followed the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
One FTSE-100 CEO told Reuters they had met
Labour's top team several times and the party had made a strong
""pitch"" to business.
Laura Foll, portfolio manager at Janus
Henderson Investors, said it looked like Britain was returning to an era when
""boring is good"".
But for voters, real-life difficulties are
more of a pressing concern, with people crying out for Labour to tackle the
ailing health service, widen educational opportunities and improve living
standards.
For some, although they wanted the
Conservatives out of power, they had not fallen in love with Labour, or with
Starmer.
""I'm excited about change, but I don't
really love the Labour Party,"" said Ellie O'Connell, 28, at the
Glastonbury music festival.
Sitting in the courtyard of a doctors'
surgery, Starmer sipped tea with patients before the election, listening to
them complain about how difficult it was to get an appointment.
His offer of helping train more doctors,
reducing bureaucracy and getting better control over budgets missed out one
thing that might help - more money, something his new government will not have
much of.
Asked by Reuters how he would better retain
doctors who say their salaries are uncompetitive internationally, he said:
""I don't have a wand that I can wave to fix all the problems when it comes
to salaries overnight if we win the election.""
With only 9 billion pounds ($11 billion) of
so-called fiscal headroom - barely a third of the average for governments since
2010 - Starmer might have to keep pressing the message that change will take
time.
That may cut short any political honeymoon -
the respite voters and newspapers offer incoming administrations from
criticism.
This cautious approach has also alienated
some on the left of the party. Asked how he thought Starmer would be as prime
minister, James Schneider, former director of communications for Corbyn, said:
""When push comes to shove, he will be on the side of bosses over
workers.""

Telco giant Safaricom has donated Ksh.15
million to the Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) to support individuals
injured during the recent anti-government protests receiving treatment at
the facility.
Of this amount, Ksh.10 million will be
allocated to the hospital's Disaster Response Centre, with the remaining Ksh.5
million designated to aid the injured and affected persons.
""The Ksh.5 million will be for provision
of assistive devices to the injured, smart-phones and airtime for those who
lost their phones, supporting affected individuals with three months’ worth of
food as well as one year worth of rent for those in extreme condition,""
Safaricom said in a statement to newsrooms.
“Safaricom has also allocated Ksh.12.5
million for similar efforts across the country.""
Speaking at KNH when the donation was
made, Safaricom CEO Peter Ndegwa underscored the telco's commitment to
supporting Kenyans injured during the demonstrations.
“Our foundations are there to stand with
people, especially in times of need. We are happy to provide hospitals with
structured support in times of emergencies, both for infrastructure improvement
and patient recovery,"" he said.
To provide further immediate support,
Safaricom, through its M-Pesa Foundation, is organizing medical camps in
affected areas, starting with Githurai on July 6, 2024, followed by Rongai at a
later date.
Safaricom, in the medium term, also plans to
engage its Gen Z employees, along with other similarly-minded corporations and
foundations, through the #GenZforGenZ initiative, which will involve volunteer
teams taking the lead in community outreach efforts, organizing clean-up
activities, and facilitating medical camps.
""The long-term plan will entail a
comprehensive execution of community programs through M-Pesa and Safaricom
Foundations, with an increased focus on Gen Z. This includes providing TVET
scholarships, economic empowerment through the Ndoto Zetu program,
agri-business value chain opportunities through the Wezesha Agri Program, and
offering access to business training and micro loans in 13 counties, starting
with Nakuru, Nairobi, Kajiado, and Migori,"" the telco added.
""The plan will also include supporting
mental health through strategic partnerships and provision of complimentary
counselling services.""

https://www.citizen.digital/news/ksh87000-daily-for-uganda-trip-how-much-kenyan-public-officers-are-paid-per-day-for-foreign-travel-n345208,"Ksh.87,000 daily for Uganda trip: How much Kenyan public officers are paid per day for foreign travel
Kenyans online have criticised the Kenya Kwanza administration for living a luxury lifestyle that does not reflect the current state of affairs.
From numerous travels to high-value spending, Kenyans have questioned the doublespeak by politicians calling on the public to live within their means while at the same time boasting an expensive lifestyle.
A circular released by the Salaries and Remunerations Commission (SRC) on August 7, 2023, shows that public officers receive a minimum of Ksh.20,000 from foreign travel depending on the country.
The Daily Subsistence Allowance (DSA) paid to public officers aims at facilitating them to attend to official assignments away from their duty stations either locally or internationally. The rates are standardised based on an officer's job grade from the lowest (A) to the highest (E).
High-ranking officers in this case refer to directors, ambassadors, registrars, Commissioners and Deputy Commissioners, and Committee Chairpersons among others.
Low-ranking officers account for support staff, attendants, and drivers among others.
Local Travel
The highest-ranking public officer earns an average of Ksh.18,200 when travelling to a city, county headquarters or another town.
In turn, the lowest-ranked officer earns Ksh.4,200 per diem.
The daily subsistence allowance, however, does not cover locations that are within a 50-kilometre radius of respective duty stations.
Foreign Travel
The highest amount a high-ranking public officer can earn as allowance in a single day is Ksh.167,416 if they travel to Singapore. On the same trip, a low-ranking officer gets Ksh.47,243.
On the other hand, the lowest DSA a high-ranking officer can get is if they travel to Laos - a Southeast Asian Country (Ksh.50,470) and in turn a low-ranking officer gets Ksh.19,749.
A trip to Dubai will see the officers earn a range of Ksh.49,050 to Ksh.121,851 while those heading to the USA will get from Ksh.50,728 to Ksh.93,453.
Officers will earn Ksh.119,269 daily to travel to Italy, France (Ksh.102,747), China (Ksh.82,998) and Germany (Ksh.119,011).
In Africa, public officers are paid Ksh.87,387 daily allowance to travel to Uganda, Ksh.85,580 to Tanzania, Ksh.104,425 to Ethiopia and Ksh.75,899 for Rwanda.
Kenyans have since called on the government to cut down on public expenditure to reflect the status quo. On Wednesday, President Ruto directed the treasury to review the new salary structure for Cabinet Secretaries, PSs, governors, MCAs and other state officers. The structure was to take effect from July 1, 2024.

Masara said every person in Kenya can testify that they have benefited from a project funded by CDF, unlike other funds.
He said CDF should remain, urging the senators to focus on their oversight on the governors.
Meanwhile the Member of Parliament for Suna West has also rubbished the directive from the president banning state officials and public servants from participating in funds drive.
Masara said he cannot adhere to the directive that has not been passed in parliament. The Member of Parliament for Suna West said he will continue with all the fund drives that he has already planned.

At the onset, a mother needs to take folic acid supplements, at the very least to lower the risk birth defects such as Spina bifida, which is when a baby's spine and spinal cord do not develop properly in the womb, causing a gap in the spine.
Throughout her pregnancy, there is the cost of obstetrician and gynecologist visits, plus several tests to make sure mother and baby are doing well.
Then comes the delivery, which can take up a significant amount of money for an uncomplicated delivery, but a lot more if there are complications.
After this process, then comes the duty of raising a child and catering to their costs – from vaccines to hospital visits, especially during the initial critical months and years to when they have flourished into little ones ready to get the first dose of what the world looks like away from home when they go to school.
Here, many parents in middle-income families aiming to take their children to private schools are presented with many decisions to make: which school should I take my child to? What curriculum is best suited to my child’s talents and personality? Do the schools I’m thinking of enrolling my child in have the values that are important to me? What fees structure will be sustainable for me?
The questions are endless.
A tried and tested way of reducing the stress that can come with choosing a school has been the referral method. Parents have many times looked to their circles to get recommendations on good schools. While it works sometimes, the reality is that children and values are different and this has led to some parents facing disappointments when they enrol their children in what they thought was a good school, but it turns out not to be a good fit for their child.
Then comes the stress of having to look for another school and the initial costs spent on the previous school going down the drain.
Speaking to Wananchi Reporting, Tina Owino spoke of how she spent a tidy sum before finding a good fit for her son:
“I had bought the uniform, paid the caution money, nonrefundable enrollment fee and a lot more, only to have to pull him out of the school because he just wasn’t adjusting well to the school,” she said.
Tina continued, “I had opted to take him there after getting glowing recommendations from my friends, but it just wasn’t for him. The school may not be bad, but he just didn’t like it and it was taking a toll on him. He was losing his joy and became withdrawn.”
She said she later was encouraged to try enrolling him at another school, where they give students a chance to try out the school for a week to get a taste of what it’s like to school there then decide if it’s a good fit.
“You may not know whether a school is a good fit within a week, but it’s definitely better than just going straight without trying, only to find it’s not the kind of school you envision your child being in,” Tina said.
Tina’s experience presents a new tactic several private, day schools are adopting in a bid to woo parents to enroll their children in their institutions as competition hots up.
Frankline Wahome talks about his experience when searching for a school for his daughter:
“My wife was skeptical about letting our daughter start school as she worried if she was too young and how she would cope. She was two-and-a-half years old at the time but since we live in a stand-alone house, we realized she wasn’t getting the interaction she needed with other children,” he said.
Wahome continued to say that he visited several schools to scout for possible options and several offered a free trial week to allow his daughter to get real practical experience and determine if she liked it.
He says it worked well and put his wife at ease.
“With the first school which we took her too, she would come home stressed. We thought it might be because it takes time to accept a new environment with other children and we decided to keep the school in mind. However, when we tried another school, she would actually get excited about going to school… that is how we ended up enrolling her in the school,” Wahome said.
With competition rising, several schools have adopted free trials where the message is to ""drop your child and we'll take care of everything else, from food, to learning and extracurricular activities"".
The hope is that the child, and parent, like what the school has to offer enough to commit to enrolling their child after the free trial week.
The private schools have not only focused on free trials but invested in other infrastructure and programmes to keep demanding parents happy.
For younger children, many private schools have invested in well-equipped playgrounds or refurbished existing ones. Others have put in place other extracurricular activities, from martial arts, horse riding and more to attract parents keen on nurturing their children’s skills.
Some institutions have also onboarded parents in their marketing campaigns, with rewards for successful enrollments, plus the promise of discounts for paying early or with every subsequent child enrolled at the school.

According to her mother Alice Karuana Muriithi, the girl went missing on Thursday before she was discovered tied with banana fibres in river Gakungu on Friday .
The grade 2 pupil at St Philips Primary School Baricho had gone to the shopping centre in the company of her cousin before she went missing.
Kirinyaga West sub sub-county police commander Moses Koskei has said police have launched investigations as residents say the suspect is known.
“We want the suspect arrested, we know him, he is a bhang peddler, the other day he raped his mother and nothing was done,” Pastor Jeremiah Muriithi said.
Relatives led by girl’s grandmother Faith Wambui are demanding justice.
“The suspect lured the girl to his house before defiling her then dumped her in river Gakungu. We suspect he stayed with her in his house on Thursday before killing her on Friday afternoon. We are demanding justice,” Wambui said.
The incident has shocked Baricho and nearby schools.
The body of the girl is lying at Kerugoya mortuary waiting postmortem.
“I promise you the suspect will be arrested after investigations,” Koskei said.

The Barcelona playmaker had to be substituted after just eight minutes in the clash in Stuttgart, which Spain won 2-1 after extra-time.
In a statement on Saturday the Spanish football federation said the 21-year-old had suffered a ""grade two ligament sprain"" but will remain in Germany to support his team-mates for the rest of the tournament.
According to Spanish media reports he will be sidelined for a month.
Pedri was injured after a robust challenge early on from Toni Kroos in what turned out to be the final match of the Germany midfielder's career.
Former Real Madrid star Kroos sent his best wishes as he penned an emotional letter to Germany fans on Saturday.
""Get better soon Pedri. Obviously, it was not my intention to cause any damage,"" Kroos posted on Instagram.
""Wishing you a speedy recovery and all the best. You are a great player.""
Spain face France in the last four in Munich on Tuesday.
Dani Olmo is expected to replace Pedri in Luis de la Fuente's starting line-up after scoring the opening goal and then assisting Mikel Merino's late winner against the hosts.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/kenyan-police-arrival-in-haiti-marks-new-era-for-security-prime-minister-tells-un-n345184,"Kenyan police arrival in Haiti marks new era for security, prime minister tells UN
""The arrival of the first contingent of the Multinational Security Support kicks off a new era in Haiti,"" Conille told diplomats in New York.
""Haiti is currently at a critical point with 12,000 armed individuals holding a population of 12 million hostage.""
Some 200 Kenyan police arrived in Haiti last week as part of the long-delayed mission mandated to help national police fight armed gangs that have taken over most of Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince - fueling a humanitarian crisis that has driven nearly 600,000 from their homes and 5 million into severe food insecurity.
The full force is set to number over 2,500, but it remains unclear when these could arrive, while funding has lagged far behind requirements.
Haiti's outgunned and under-resourced police, meanwhile, counted just over 12,000 officers at the end of May - down 1,000 since the start of the year - according to a report by the U.N. Integrated Mission in Haiti (BINUH).
Neighboring Dominican Republic's Foreign Minister Roberto Alvarez in the meeting made ""an urgent appeal to all countries that have committed funding to the MSS to fulfill their pledges and to deposit those funds as soon as possible,"" referring to the Multinational Security Support by its acronym.
Without substantial additional funding, BINUH said, the mission will be unable to complete a 12-month deployment, whose initial mandate ends in October.
BINUH also warned that more clashes between police and gangs meant that more civilians, including very young children, were being killed by stray bullets and it had reports of police summarily killing passers-by.
Gangs are also recruiting and arming more children in preparation for the MSS deployment, it said, warning it was difficult to identify the ages of those killed or injured in clashes.
Conille said reforming the national police, whose chief he replaced shortly after coming to power last month, was ""indispensable"" for restoring public trust.
Kenya's U.N. deputy envoy Njambi Kinyungu said the first contingent had been warmly received and was beginning joint operations with Haitian police.
Diplomats from China and Russia also emphasized stemming the flow of firearms to gangs. Most illegal guns seized in Haiti, and across the wider Caribbean, have been traced back to the United States.
Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said the U.N. should strengthen its sanctions regime by targeting traffickers, who unlike the five local gang leaders already sanctioned, are more vulnerable to foreign asset freezes and travel bans.
""We do not see the current embargo doing anything to prevent the flow of arms from the U.S.,"" Nebenzia said. ""The committee experts are clearly not eager to get into a disagreement with Washington.""
Speaking before Nebenzia, the United States' U.N. ambassador, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said the government was ""actively working"" to enforce the arms embargo, citing recent prosecutions, a new e-tracing agreement and rules to reduce gun sales without background checks.

Champions Italy take on Switzerland in the Euro 2024 last 16 on Saturday after making it through the group phase by the skin of their teeth.
The Azzurri needed a 98th minute equaliser from relative unknown Mattia Zaccagni against Croatia to secure second spot in Group B, five points behind tournament standard-setters Spain.
Coach Luciano Spalletti said his team deserved to progress but undermined those words by criticising players for a timid performance in their final group game.
The 65-year-old coach also lashed out against media and anybody putting pressure on his side, with his performative outrage perhaps an attempted distraction from his inability to get the two-time winners firing.
At times contradicting himself, Spalletti also claimed his team had been improving through the tournament.
""Thus far everything they've done has been getting better, from my perspective,"" he said.
However to the outside world his new-look Italy seem unconvincing and a significant downgrade on the side that triumphed at Euro 2020 - where they beat Switzerland 3-0 in the group phase.
Both goalscorers that day, Manuel Locatelli with a brace and Ciro Immobile, were left out of the squad by Spalletti, along with midfielder Marco Verratti.
Key defenders Leonardo Bonucci and Giorgio Chiellini have retired and Juventus forward Federico Chiesa has been far from his best.
Lazio forward Zaccagni, 29, insisted his team could take a step forward in the knock-out rounds.
""Now we're just thinking about preparing for a very important match against Switzerland,"" he told UEFA's website on Thursday.
""We have always known that the national team often suffers and then comes out in the moments that count. And now we expect just that from ourselves.""
Murat Yakin's Switzerland boast several Serie A players in their squad, including Inter Milan goalkeeper Yann Sommer and Bologna trio Dan Ndoye, Remo Freuler and Michel Aebischer.
""We have already seen many videos of Switzerland -- they are a very compact team, they play for each other and it will take a great match to beat them,"" added Zaccagni.
Italy will be without the suspended Riccardo Calafiori but Zaccagni says he is ready to play despite hurting his ribs under a pile of jubilant players celebrating his stunning late goal.
Questions remain over Italy's best set-up, with Spalletti changing shape against Croatia, while holding midfielder Jorginho has struggled in particular.
Striker Mateo Retegui worked hard against Croatia but did not convince either, just as Gianluca Scamacca failed to in their opening 2-1 win over Albania and 1-0 defeat by Spain.
In years past Switzerland, who also pipped Italy to qualification to the last World Cup, would be looked upon as a favourable opponent but they showed against Germany in their current shape they can threaten any team.
They went through Group A unbeaten, with Germany needing a 92nd minute goal to earn a 1-1 draw against the Swiss in the final group game.
That result may have been a blessing in disguise as it knocked Switzerland into second place and into what is being seen as the easier half of the draw - Germany, Spain, Portugal, France and Belgium are on the other side.
Switzerland proved at Euro 2020 they can put the cat among the pigeons, knocking out Kylian Mbappe's France on penalties in the last 16 before Spain returned the favour in the quarter-finals.
That victory will give them confidence to try and equal their best ever finish in the tournament by reaching the last eight.
""Regarding the round of 16, we know how to win, but we also know how to lose it,"" Freuler told UEFA.
""We need an even better performance than in the three group games. Saturday has to be our best performance in recent years.""
The winners will face England or Slovakia in the quarter-finals.

Former world number one Naomi Osaka said it felt ""like
a dream"" to claim her first win at Wimbledon since 2018 as she looked
forward to celebrating the occasion with her daughter, who turns one on
Tuesday.
Japanese star Osaka, a four-time Grand Slam winner,
recovered from a break down in the final set to defeat Diane Parry of France
6-1, 1-6, 6-4 on the back of 34 winners.
""It feels like a dream because I haven't played here
many times,"" said Osaka, whose last appearance at the All England Club was
in 2019, when she exited in the first round.
""I hope it was fun for everyone to watch. I'm really
excited to be here because Wimbledon was the first tournament I watched last
year after my pregnancy.""
Osaka said she was inspired to victory by casting a glance
at her photographs from last year, when she gave birth to daughter Shai.
""I was looking at my photo album. Like, they have that
feature 'this time last year'. I was looking at that. I was looking at photos
of myself in the hospital.
""It's really cool to be here now. I think my mindset
last year was just trying to survive. Honestly, I didn't really know what was
going on after I gave birth. Yeah, just trying to piece myself back
together.""
Osaka raced through the first set on Monday in just 22
minutes before her 53rd-ranked rival levelled the contest.
In a rollercoaster decider, Parry was 3-1 ahead before Osaka
battled back to 3-3.
Osaka then saved two break points to edge 5-4 ahead and
claimed victory when Parry served up her 10th double fault of the match.
Osaka, who only returned to the tour at the start of the season
after maternity leave, is ranked at 113 and required a wild card to play at
Wimbledon.
At the recent French Open, she gave world number one Iga
Swiatek a mighty scare, holding a match point in their second-round clash
before the Pole prevailed.
""My heart was racing today. These are the types of
matches you need to play to ease into the tournament,"" she said.
""I'm glad I didn't have to play a final-set
tiebreaker.""
Osaka said she found it a challenge to dig deep when she was
down a break in the decider.
""I can be a little bit down on myself but I'm really
trying to stay positive,"" explained the 26-year-old.
""There's a really nice man over here that was just
telling me 'Come on Naomi' and I was like 'Yeah, I got this, I got this' so
thank you.""
Osaka said her daughter's birthday party will be a low-key
affair with a cake and a good book.
""I bought her a birthday present but I feel like I'm
constantly buying her birthday presents. I bought her a book, so hopefully
she's satisfied with the book,"" she said of her purchase of Beatrix
Potter's classic ""The Tale of Peter Rabbit"".
Osaka will face US 19th seed Emma Navarro or Wang Qiang of
China for a place in the last 32.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/we-have-enough-pastors-govt-questioned-for-funding-rachael-ruto-dorcas-rigathi-offices-n344623,"‘We have enough pastors!’ Gov't questioned for funding Rachel Ruto, Dorcas Rigathi offices
Nominated MP John Mbadi has criticised
President William Ruto’s government over what he calls a waste of public funds
to run First Lady Rachel Ruto and Second Lady Dorcas Rigathi’s offices.
Mrs Ruto’s Office of the First Lady has
since 2022 been involved in initiatives around religion and women's economic
empowerment under a strategy she has christened ‘faith diplomacy’.
On the other hand, Mrs Rigathi who had been
a pastor long before Rigathi Gachagua became the deputy president, has through
the Office of the Spouse of the Deputy President been running ‘boychild empowerment’ programs targeting Kenyan youth hooked on drug and substance
abuse.
Both offices have been allocated Ksh.1.2
billion in total for the 2024/2025 financial year starting July, with Mrs Ruto's
office getting Ksh.696.6 million and Mrs Rigathi’s Ksh.557.5 million.
But Mbadi says Ruto’s government has misplaced
its priorities by pumping public funds towards the two offices as Kenyans grapple with
a high cost of living.
He says Kenyans do not need Mrs Ruto and
Mrs Rigathi’s religious leadership.
“What is the priority? You are creating the
office of the First Lady and the wife of the Deputy President and giving them
money to go and pray across the country? We have enough pastors and
evangelists!” Mbadi told Citizen TV’s Daybreak program on Tuesday.
“We don’t need the president’s and deputy
president’s wife to preach to us; that is not a priority. If they want to, let
them do it without involving our taxes.”
The nominated MP criticised Ruto for urging
Kenyans to 'tighten their belts' over increased taxation as his government spends
money on projects like the Ksh.11 billion renovation of all State Houses and
State Lodges.
“The problem with our expenditure is not
salaries but operations and maintenance. That is why the youth are in the
streets telling us we cannot claim to be tightening our belts as you tax us,
yet you are renovating all State Houses at a go,” Mbadi added.

Published on: July 05, 2024 10:54 (EAT)
The Confederation of African Football (CAF) said Friday they had fined Cameroon football federation president Samuel Eto'o a total of $200,000 for a brand deal they determined to be an ethics violation.
The former Barcelona and Inter Milan star had been accused of ""alleged manipulation of football matches"", of which the CAF disciplinary board found there was ""insufficient proof"", the organisation said in a statement.
But they determined Eto'o had ""violated the principles of ethics, integrity and sportsmanship"" by accepting a paid brand deal with an online gambling company, and dealt him a fine of $200,000.
In a statement, Eto'o's lawyers said the decision was ""surprising in several respects"".
""The alleged facts do not result from a competition organised by CAF,"" said the ex-player's lawyers. They further added that CAF did not have the jurisdiction to hand down the ruling, particularly when ""CAF has neither a code of ethics nor an ethics commission"".
Eto'o is set to ""appeal the decision before CAF's appeals board"", according to his lawyers.
The former international striker, 43, recently made headlines after a heated exchange with Cameroon national team coach Marc Brys, who was chosen by the country's sports ministry without the approval of Eto'o.

Owners of the NBA champion Boston Celtics announced they were putting the club up for sale on Monday, two weeks after capturing the team's record 18th NBA championship.
The Celtics were valued at $4.7 billion last October by Forbes magazine, having leaped 18% in value to rank behind only the Golden State Warriors ($7.7 billion), New York Knicks ($6.6 billion) and Los Angeles Lakers ($6.4 billion).
Wyc Grousbeck led a group that bought the Celtics in 2002 for $360 million.
But NBA clubs have sold for much bigger sums in recent months, with the Phoenix Suns going to Mat Ishbia in February 2023 for $4 billion and a co-ownership stake in the Milwaukee Bucks going to Jimmy and Dee Haslam for $3.5 billion last year.
The Dallas Mavericks, who lost to Boston in last month's NBA Finals, were sold last December with casino moguls Miriam Adelson and Patrick Dumont purchasing a 69% majority stake in the club for $3.8 billion.
""Boston Basketball Partners LLC, the ownership group of the Boston Celtics, announced today its intension to sell all the shares of the team,"" Celtics ownership said in a statement.
""The controlling family of the ownership group, after considerable thought and internal discussion, has decided to sell the team for estate and family planning considerations.
""The managing board of the ownership group expects to sell a majority interest in 2024 or early 2025 with the balance closing in 2028.""
Grousbeck is expected to remain the team's representative on the NBA Board of Governors until the final sale completion in 2028, the ownership said.
Under the current owners, the Celtics won the NBA title in 2008, beating the Los Angeles Lakers, lost the final to Lakers in 2010 and dropped the 2022 final to Golden State before claiming this year's crown.

Speaking during a church service in Nyeri on Sunday, she said that the budget withdrawal will not impede her from pursuing reforms for the boychild, noting that she started the mission even before achieving prominence.
""The nation has said that they do not want the second lady to have any budget and it is okay but I will not stop working with the boychild. That is a passion and a vision I have for the boychild,"" she said.
""I cannot stop because I even started before I was in the office and I believe that you and I can be able to make it.""
She further urged the church to embrace and rehabilitate drug addicts and help them reform into resourceful individuals in society.
President William Ruto on Friday announced a raft of austerity measures across various government agencies to align the country’s budgetary expenditure to the implications of the withdrawn Finance Bill, 2024.
Ruto announced that the offices of the first lady, the second lady, and the spouse of the Prime Cabinet Secretary will be scrapped.
“Similarly, budget provisions for confidential budgets in various Executive offices including my own office have been removed, and the budget for the renovations across government reduced by 50 per cent,” Ruto said.
Pastor Dorcas has been at the forefront of championing for creating reforms for the Kenyan male child, especially those consuming illicit liquor and using hard drugs.
She has highlighted the plight of the Kenyan boychild, arguing that they should be equipped with appropriate tools to be the leaders in society.

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/ebwali-fc-vihiga-boys-battle-pressure-as-county-sports-heats-up-n345231,"Ebwali FC, Vihiga Boys battle pressure as county sports heats up
As the Vihiga County Secondary School Sports Association enters its second day this Thursday, Ebwali FC coach Francis Muhambe remains cautious, aware that every team is eager to defeat them.
Speaking at Mumboha Sports Ground after Ebwali's 3-0 victory over Emuhaya’s Ebusiloli Boys team, Muhambe revealed the pressure of advancing past the County stage, as opponents prepare intensely to face Ebwali FC.
“I have to approach one match at a time. Everyone is strategizing to beat Ebwali. In our opening match against Ebusiloli, the second-half substitutions made the difference. Derick Oketch scored our first goal, followed by a brace from Austin Odongo.
Derick Gachui changed the game when I brought him in after halftime. Otherwise, Ebusiloli had managed to hold us in the first half,” stated Muhambe, acknowledging that every team in Vihiga trains specifically to beat or draw with Ebwali.
Ebwali later secured a 4-0 victory over Hamisi’s Senende Boys, placing them at the top of Pool A with six points. Vihiga Boys, who lost 3-2 to Chavakali Boys before defeating Ebusiloli 4-1, follow with three points. Chavakali also secured a 2-0 win against Senende, tying with Ebwali at the top of the pool.
“Technical mistakes and lack of stamina caused us to lose our game to Ebwali, whom we had successfully held in the first half,” lamented Atolwa Ngobolia, the Ebusiloli soccer team tactician.
Vihiga Boys began their campaign to defend their County title on a shaky note, falling 3-2 to Chavakali Boys in their opening match. However, Coach Dancan Kihima adjusted their formation in the next game against Ebusiloli.
“My players started very slowly, which led to the loss against Chavakali. The underdogs are also posing a threat because we are not accustomed to their style of play. My focus is to beat Ebwali and Senende today,” Kihima said, adding that he aims to reach the semifinals if he can secure the County title, rather than setting an overly ambitious goal of winning the Western region title.
On the girls' side, Madira Secondary School from Vihiga Constituency and Ibubi’s Maroon Commandos from Luanda began their campaign positively, securing maximum points in their opening matches played at Ebusakami Primary Ground, which hosts Pool B soccer teams.
Madira defeated Ebusiratsi’s St. Bakhita’s 7-0 after a 4-0 win against Vokoli. Ibubi also triumphed, beating St. Bakhita’s 2-0 before defeating Kapsotik 8-0.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/no-dialogue-action-now-wiper-backs-gen-zs-rubbishes-ruto-raila-proposal-n345605,"‘No dialogue, action now!’ Wiper backs Gen Zs, rubbishes Ruto-Raila proposal
The Wiper party has faulted President William
Ruto for seeking an engagement with Kenyan youth as a solution for the
continued anti-government protests.
The Kalonzo Musyoka-led party, in a statement
to newsrooms on Wednesday, took issue with calls to engage the youth saying the
current regime is ignorant of the message by Gen Zs which is ‘action now.’
The
opposition-affiliated party thus appealed to President Ruto to instead deal
with Gen Z concerns by addressing the issues raised through the recent protests
rather than pushing to have a meeting with their so-called representatives.
“In
terms of the Gen Z revolution, it appears that Ruto lacks an understanding of
public sentiment. Generation Z does not wish to engage in dialogue. They want
action, and Wiper agrees,” said the party in the statement after a National
Executive Committee (NEC) meeting.
The
party said the challenges presently plaguing the country are beyond dialogue,
and require only implementation.
It
also cited the National Dialogue Committee (NADCO) formed last year to address
issues surrounding Finance Bill 2023, underscoring that despite the committee recommending
certain findings, the whole process was inconsequential to the needs of Kenyans
at the time.
In
the same way, Wiper said the solution would be to implement the needs of Gen Zs
to the latter, among them posting of medical interns, dissolving Parliament,
and sacking corrupt government officials.
“The
current situation in Kenya could have been avoided if the regime had addressed
rising living costs and implemented the National Dialogue Committee findings.
You don't need dialogue. Dialogue is not required to assess public debt because
the Auditor General's Office has the same role,” the statement noted.
“The
attempt to usurp the Constitution by forming a task force on the subject is
equally telling. You do not need dialogue to post medical interns or to sack
corrupt government officials.”
Wiper
added: “The sialogue Gen Z and Kenyans are demanding is that Parliament stands
dissolved, a snap election being called, and that Ruto go home. And Wiper
Democratic Movement agrees.”
The
party at the same time committed its support to the Gen Z movement urging them
to also consider inviting Kalonzo in social media spaces for engagement
purposes.
“We
will continue to engage with our youth on all platforms available. We ask our young
Wiper Democrats to open up the social media spaces and invite the party
leadership including the party leader to them. We want you to take the lead in
shaping the conversation here and on the national platform,” said the party.
Wiper’s
remarks come after President Ruto and Azimio la Umoja One Kenya leader Raila
Odinga pushed for talks with Gen Zs, a move that attracted public uproar and
condemnation.
Mr. Odinga
on Tuesday faced harsh criticism for backing calls by the President
to engage with Gen Zs, where netizens trolled him for purporting to represent
them in the said talks.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/ruto-resignation-mps-pay-cuts-gen-zs-unveil-fresh-demands-as-protests-take-new-life-n344879,"Ruto resignation, MPs’ pay cuts: Gen Zs unveil fresh demands as protests take new life
Over the last week, anti-Finance Bill 2024 protests
have taken a life of their own, with the protesters taking to different social
media platforms to express their frustration with the current government.
The
protest evolved into a call for accountability in government with both elected
and appointed public servants being put on notice over their conduct.
When
the Gen Zs first took to the streets, their rallying call was crystal clear, to
reject Finance Bill 2024.
After
days of sustained pressure, President Ruto was convinced, to reconsider his
stand on the Finance Bill that would have seen Kenyans dig deeper in their
pockets to fund government operations.
However,
the President's delayed response to the matter, partially opened the door to
the inclusion of other issues to be raised by the citizenry who came up with a
list of demands that they want addressed by the government.
The youths have now issued
demands to the government with some calling for President Ruto's resignation.
Top
of the list posted online and designated “non-negotiable“ is the call for the
Executive to obey all court orders and scrap the illegal and illegitimate Chief
Administrative Secretary (CAS) position, as well as the removal of public
funding of the Office of the First Lady, Second Lady and Prime Cabinet
Secretary’s Spouse, and instead redirect those funds to employing teachers and
doctors.
Further,
the list also calls for the scrapping of the housing levy, the publishing of
audited records on how the funds have been utilised and refunds for all
contributors.
The
list calls for the immediate firing of all government officials with criminal
records and integrity issues, while being advised to constitute the IEBC within
the next 30 days and employ JSS teachers and intern doctors.
More
demands have been made for the reduction of Members of Parliaments’ salaries
and allowances, capping them at Ksh.200,000.
The
protesters insist that MPs should not earn more than doctors, and are also calling
for the restoration of the school feeding programme.
To
curb wastage, the list advises that all government officials should use
government vehicles, trains and airplanes.
The final
demand is that the President resigns from office.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) on Thursday invited 22 Russian and 17 Belarusian athletes to compete at the Paris Olympics as neutrals even though some have already decided against taking part.
A second list of names authorised to compete in the July 26-August 11 showpiece included competitors from tennis, shooting and rowing.
The first list, which was published on June 15, was limited to four disciplines -- wrestling, weightlifting, cycling and trampoline.
That also included the first refusals including Russian cyclist Aleksandr Vlasov and five Belarusians.
Eighteen athletes have, however, already confirmed their presence - three cyclists, three trampoline specialists, two weightlifters and 10 wrestlers.
Two Belarusian rowers and two Belarusian fencers have yet to make their response known.
There is similar suspense amongst the list of tennis players issued on Thursday with Russians Daniil Medvedev and Andrey Rublev, currently ranked world number five and six respectively, yet to officially respond.
The same applies to leading women's players such as Belarusian duo Aryna Sabalenka, the third-ranked Australian Open champion, and former world number one Victoria Azarenka.
However, Russian Tennis Federation president Shamil Tarpischev earlier this month said that Rublev, 2021 silver medallist Karen Khachanov as well as women's 15th-ranked Liudmila Samsonova will not play at the Olympics.
Sabalenka has also said she will not take part in the Paris Olympics.
""Especially with all the struggles I've been struggling with the last months, I feel I have to take care of my health,"" Sabalenka told reporters last week.
""It's too much for the scheduling and I made the decision to take care of my health.""
To be invited to the Games as a ""neutral individual athlete"", competitors first have to satisfy their individual federation's qualifying criteria.
Then they are subject to checks over any indication they may have supported the war in Ukraine or have links with their country's military.

https://www.citizen.digital/wananchi-reporting/how-i-almost-gave-away-my-identity-man-narrates-close-shave-with-online-cons-n344900,"How I almost gave away my identity: Man narrates close shave with online cons
One man who was close to pretty much giving away his identity after cons sought his personal details, narrated to Wananchi Reporting his close shave escaping the trap of scammers after his mother raised the alarm.
Here is his story:
This is not a new topic of discussion. It is something that has been happening since the early 90's. Criminals take advantage of unsuspecting citizens using digital platforms to defraud them or steal their personal information.
WhatsApp has become a tool used by these criminals. For a long time, WhatsApp has been considered a fortress for the storage of personal data, reason being, due to it's end-to-end encryption code which facilitates direct transmission of messages between two parties.
This means that there is no intermediary between thus no one can access any personal information. But this tough-to-crack code has not stopped criminals from trying to defraud people.
Many people have fallen victim to these individuals and I was close to being a statistic.
This is how it happened: I received a message from one of my former classmates in our alumni WhatsApp group. This message was a link to another WhatsApp business account. The sender of the link claimed that the link was from a nongovernmental organization and that it was giving money as part of its social responsibility efforts.
He had even sent pictures of his M-Pesa account receiving money from UNICEF to back his claims. I proceeded to click on the link cautiously. Little did I know what situation I was getting myself into.
It started as a normal conversation.
""Hi... I’m interested in this promotion thing.""
The guy on the other side answered and explained to me in vivid details what the promotion was all about. He told me that it aimed at helping orphans all over Africa. Looking back, I now realize that he said this in order to play with my psychology.
Obviously, to blind my eyes into thinking that I was dealing with the real deal. He explained that I had to give them a few personal details, namely; my name, phone number and my age.
And I did. They further gave me a few options to choose from. I was to send certain amounts of money and get more than triple in return. For example, sending Ksh. 1,199 for Ksh. 18,000.
That's when my sixth sense started kicking in but I was eager to know the endgame.
I decided to play a game with the devil, a decision that I knew would indefinitely come to bite me in the back if I was not careful.
I told them that I did not have instant cash then and that it would take time before I did. I stood there eagerly waiting for a response. Turns out that that was the answer they were waiting for and they had been using the personal data I had sent them to hack my WhatsApp account in the background.
This meant that they cold easily link it with their own and it would be easy for them to gain access to all my accounts and other personal details.
However, what prevented them from doing so was that they lacked a certain code that would allow them to have full access to my WhatsApp account. So, they decided to call me and have a one-on-one conversation with me.
The number they used was from an unknown number. I answered disregarding the consequences. The guy on the other side explained to me that he was the guy from the NGO promotion that I had been chatting with.
Simultaneously, I received a message from WhatsApp which had the same code they wanted. The caller told me to read him the code so that he could give me the money I wanted without sending them the money they wanted.
When a deal looks too good to be true, it usually isn't and you should think twice before taking it. Looking at the code clearly, it had clear instructions that I should not share it with anyone.
I asked him why he was so interested in it when there were clear instructions telling me not to share it with anyone. Of course, a good con man doesn't quit easily and he gave me a long explanation for it, one that almost had me convinced.
My mom was close by, listening to the conversation and she took my phone and told off the guy on the other side. She hung up and went on to block that number. She went ahead to tell me about a colleague who had been conned in a similar manner.
I learnt my lesson. Avoid clicking any links sent to you from your friends especially those that promise you free money.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/mp-ruku-says-he-will-withdraw-bill-seeking-to-give-govt-power-to-suppress-protests-n344782,"MP Ruku says he will withdraw Bill seeking to give gov’t power to suppress protests
Mbeere North Member of Parliament Geoffrey
Ruku has resolved to withdraw a proposed law he has sponsored seeking to have the
government regulate public demonstrations and protests.
The Assembly and Demonstration Bill, 2024
seeks to spell out the conduct of an assembly or demonstration and outline prohibitions
during the event.
These include imposing conditions relating
to public order, safety and protection of freedom of persons.
In a post on his X account on Thursday,
Ruku said “I have heard the voice of Kenyans and therefore decided to withdraw
the Assembly and Demonstration Bill, 2024.”
“I will officially be writing to the
Speaker of the National Assembly to withdraw the Bill.”
The Bill had already sparked anger
from a section of Kenyans over concerns it would restrict peaceful
demonstrations as guaranteed in Article 37 of the constitution.
In his argument, Ruku said the
proposed law was based on “the need to give effect to Article 37 of the
Constitution and to enhance the safety and security of the protestors,
non-protestors and businesses.”
“However, I have agreed with the will of
Kenyans that the bill be withdrawn,” the MP said on Thursday.
Per Ruku’s proposed law, anyone who plans an
assembly or demonstration shall notify authorities at least three days but not
more than 14 days before the event.
The Bill gives the police power to prevent
demonstrators from changing locations or deviating from the route specified when
seeking approval.
It requires the demonstration organiser or agent
to be present throughout the assembly or demonstration and assist the police in
maintaining peace and order.
The Bill further gives the police power to
stop or prevent demonstrations “held contrary to the provisions of the proposed
law, or any that poses a present or imminent danger of a breach of the peace or
public order.”
Anyone who participates in unpermitted demonstrations
faces up to a year in prison or a Ksh.100,000 fine or both.
Additionally, the Bill lists the code of
conduct for demonstrations, whereby banners, placards, speech or singing deemed
to incite hatred on account of differences in culture, race, sex, language or
religion is outlawed.
“Perform[ing] any act or utter any words
that are calculated or likely to cause or encourage violence against any person
or group of persons,” the Bill states.
Other things the proposed legislation seeks
to outlaw are wearing masks or anything that obscures a protester’s face, clothes
that resemble police and defence forces uniforms, and possessing weapons.
Ruku’s announcement came just a day after
President William Ruto announced on Wednesday that he would not assent to the
contentious Finance Bill 2024 as a result of mounting public pressure.
The Finance Bill proposed increased taxation as
Ruto’s government sought to raise an additional Ksh.346.7 billion in revenue
for the 2024/25 budget.
It however sparked nationwide demonstrations
which turned deadly as police fired live bullets and tear gas canisters at
protesters, killing over 22, per Kenya National Commission on Human Rights
figures released on Wednesday.
Over 300 others were injured and 50 more
arrested, several of who were abducted by suspected police officers and held
incommunicado, only to be released after public uproar.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/cs-duale-now-announces-kdf-deployment-to-all-47-counties-n344882,"CS Duale now announces KDF deployment to all 47 counties
The government has approved the deployment of
the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) across all 47 counties to help reinforce
security following the aftermath of the anti-Finance Bill protests.
Defence
Cabinet Secretary Aden Duale, in a gazette notice dated June 28, said the
military would be deployed to the rest of the country to support the National
Police Service in securing key government infrastructures in accordance with the
law.
The
CS cited the Constitution and the High Court ruling which has since okayed
the deployment of the armed forces, adding that the operation shall continue
until normalcy is restored.
“Pursuant to Article 241 (3) (b) of the
Constitution of Kenya, 2010 read with sections 31 (1) (a), 31 (1) (c), 33 (1),
34 (1) and 34 (2) 35 the Kenya Defence Forces Act, the KDF deployed on the 25th
June 2024 in support of the National Police Service in response to the security
emergency caused by violent protests in various parts of the Republic of Kenya
resulting in destruction and breach of critical infrastructure,” stated Duale.
“Further
to the orders of the Court in High Court Constitutional and Human Rights
Petition Number 307 of 2024, it is notified for the general information of the
public that based on the prevailing threats to national security planned and
orchestrated through various platforms in the cyberspace, the deployment will
cover the forty-seven counties within the Republic of Kenya where critical
installations and infrastructure are located in order to assist the National
Police Service preserve life, preserve the internal security of the State,
protect property as well as maintain law and order.”
The
development comes a day after High Court Judge Lawrence Mugambi ruled
on a petition filed by the Law Society of Kenya (LSK) challenging the
deployment of the KDF to restore order after the June 25 anti-Finance Bill
protests.
Judge
Mugambi greenlighted the deployment and ordered that the terms of the deployment
be gazetted within two days.
""Continuation
of military assistance is necessary in view of the need to preserve order and
protect military infrastructure,"" stated the judge.
On
Tuesday, the National Assembly convened a special sitting to
approve the request by the Defence Council to deploy KDF amid the anti-Finance
Bill protests across the country.
According
to the Supplementary Order Paper slated for Wednesday, June 26, the action was
in line with Article 241 of the Constitution which requires approval from
Parliament before deployment of KDF is enacted.
Tuesday's #OccupyParliament protests saw
youths storm the House and wreak havoc during the demonstrations.
The
ceremonial mace, which symbolizes the authority of the legislature, was stolen,
some parts of the Parliament building vandalised and a section of it set on
fire.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/ruto-holds-cabinet-meeting-amid-calls-for-overhaul-n345195,"Ruto holds Cabinet meeting amid calls for overhaul
The Cabinet meeting comes amid reports of a looming shake-up to reshuffle some Cabinet Secretaries while others get a pink slip.
A Cabinet Secretary who spoke to the Daily Nation anonymously termed the situation as jittery and alleged that they sought to know their fate before proceeding with programs within ministries.
The meeting also follows weeks of protests as youths express dissatisfaction with Ruto's regime. Protesters have called for Ruto to step down for failing to resolve the country's woes.
Among the demands issued by the Gen Zs was the president to crack the whip on government officials who were either linked with corruption cases or performed poorly in the past two years.
Despite the piling pressure, some observers have said that the protests could be a blessing in disguise for the president as he will have an opportunity to restructure his Cabinet.
""The President is the biggest beneficiary of the anti-government protests because he now has an opportunity to reshuffle the Cabinet and reduce salaries,"" said Charles Owino, Chairperson of the Council of the Kenya Institute of Mass Communication.
Defence CS Aden Duale also maintained his stance that he sought the president to do the right thing to restore confidence in his administration.
""If the president feels I have let him down as a Minister of Defence, I want him to do the right thing, not only start with me and all the rest who have let him down, in the interest of Kenyans and tell us to step aside. I am ready,"" Duale said during JKLive interview on Wednesday.
This was echoed during a Senate session on Wednesday titled the State of the Nation where senators called for an overhaul of Ruto's cabinet. Led by Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale, the senators called for a complete restructure to reduce the public wage bill.
""Mr President, dissolve and reconstitute the Cabinet. Disband offices like the Prime Cabinet Secretary that are not constitutionally mandated in Kenya,"" Khalwale remarked.
During a roundtable discussion with the media, President Ruto reaffirmed that he could not fire a CS for facing graft charges until they are convicted in court.
""On fake fertiliser, the Minister Mithika Linturi was taken through a process in Parliament... I am a fair person and I am a believer in the rule of law. Even though I may not like you, I must respect that there is due process. the moment we will have a minister who is charged in court meaning that there's evidence that he participated in crime believe you me, I will take the action that is necessary. We must give someone the benefit of doubt until it is proven,"" Ruto said.
Kenyans now wait to see the direction that Ruto will take to restore confidence in his government and resolve the economic woes plaguing the country.

As Kisped Queens
celebrate their promotion to the national women's premier league, the team is
leaving no stone unturned in their preparations for the upcoming season.
Under the leadership
of coach Daniel Minjis, the Queens are diligently working to enhance their
squad, aiming to make a strong impression in the top-tier league.
Speaking to Citizen
Digital, Minjis, who has been at the helm of the team through their successful
campaign in the National Super League (NSL), said he is keen on reinforcing all
areas of the squad.
His primary focus,
however, lies in strengthening the midfield, which he believes is crucial for
their competitive edge in the premier league.
""We are looking
to sign new players to enhance all positions, with a special focus on the
midfield,"" said Minjis.
""The midfield is
the engine of the team, and we need it to be robust and dynamic to handle the
challenges ahead.""
Despite the ambition
to bring in fresh talent, Minjis also expressed his preference for retaining
the core squad that earned them promotion.
He values the
chemistry and cohesion built over the past season and believes that maintaining
this continuity will be beneficial as they transition to a higher level of
competition.
""Ideally, I would
like to go into the premier league with the squad we had in the NSL,""
Minjis stated. ""They've proven their capabilities and have a strong bond
that is essential for our success.""
However, Minjis
acknowledged the reality of professional sports, where player movements are
inevitable.
He admitted that if
attractive offers come in from other clubs, they would have to consider
releasing some players.

About a dozen Bolivian military officers have been arrested following Wednesday's attempted coup, a senior government minister told local television on Thursday, adding they face accusations that could lead to 15 to 30-year prison terms.
The hours-long failed coup saw the Andean nation's sacked military commander gather troops in La Paz's main square, ramming a door of the presidential palace with an armored vehicle that allowed soldiers to rush into the building.
The soldiers ultimately withdrew and police took back control of the plaza, with President Luis Arce slamming the coup attempt and swiftly naming a new top general.
The former commander, Juan Jose Zuniga, had been told on Tuesday evening that he would be stripped of his position as his conduct ""was not in line with the Constitution,"" Interior Minister Eduardo del Castillo said in an interview with TV station Unitel.
Zuniga reacted calmly to the news, according to del Castillo.
""But no one could have imagined that the next day, before the official handover in posts, there would be a failed coup in our country,"" he said.

The capital, Nairobi saw the return to business as usual as most establishments opened on Thursday.
The same was witnessed in Kisumu, Mombasa and Nakuru, the other towns that have been at the centre of the anti-finance bill and anti-government protests.
For the last two weeks, Thursdays have been marked by anti-government protests in the city but today, things were different. Despite prior plans to continue with the protests the streets of the capital remained clear of any protesters.
Instead, there was cautious optimism and businesses slowly re-opened as the day wore on. They saw little to no sign of protests unlike last week or even earlier on Tuesday.
“Last Tuesday hatukufungua sababu ya hofu na kuvurugwa…kazi iliharibika. Those who had lost days of business were eager to recover that time,” said a businesswoman Faith Mutisya.
However even as they re-opened, they reported slow customer traffic attributed to fear that the protests would happen again today.
“This is a nail spa, nimefungua around 9 kusoma rada kwanza,” said Bishara Hassan, who owns a beauty shop.
Marin Obanda added: “Hakuna wateja kwa sababu wengi bado wanahofia… ukilinganisha na Monday biashara inajikokota.”
Transport had been paralysed during the weeks of protests and demonstrations.
On Thursday however, matatu operators went about their business of ferrying passengers almost seamlessly.
Their confidence was boosted by the presence of police officers who were deployed albeit in a scaled-down manner, especially on roads leading to parliament buildings and state houses.
In Nakuru, there was relative calm after recent protests saw large crowds of protesters turn out in the streets.
The same was evident in Mombasa, which also suffered serious destruction of businesses and property and things were back to normal as protesters kept away.
In Kisii town, residents pleaded with authorities to reign in individuals liable for break-ins amid anti-finance Bill Demos nationwide.
A spot check by Citizen TV on Thursday showed a slow return to normalcy even though some business operators expressed fear after goons vandalized their premises on Tuesday.
The protests which ran every Tuesday and Thursday for the last two weeks left more than 40 people dead, more than 600 injured and property worth billions of shillings destroyed after turning violent.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/tear-gas-stones-and-flames-as-kenya-protesters-say-ruto-must-go-n345069,"Tear gas, stones and flames as Kenya protesters say 'Ruto must go!'
Riot police fired tear gas grenades and charged at stone-throwing protesters in downtown Nairobi and across Kenya on Tuesday in the most widespread unrest since at least two dozen protesters died in clashes a week ago.
The nationwide demonstrations signalled that President William Ruto had failed to appease a spontaneous youth protest movement, despite having abandoned plans for tax rises that triggered the unrest last week.
Tuesday's demonstrations began in ebullient mood but turned violent as the day wore on.
In Nairobi's downtown business district, police wearing helmets and carrying shields and wooden clubs charged at the protesters, and tear gas bombs exploded in the crowds.
A kiosk was set ablaze in the centre of a street. Medics tended to a youth who lay on the pavement with a bloody hand. Police bundled other youths into the bed of a pickup truck.
Outside the capital, hundreds of protesters marched through Mombasa, Kenya's second largest city, on the Indian Ocean coast. They carried palm fronds, blew on plastic horns and beat on drums, chanting ""Ruto must go!""
Later, Kenya's NTV television reported two people shot in Mombasa, showing pictures of cars ablaze.
Ruto, facing the worst crisis of his nearly two-year-old presidency, has been caught between the demands of lenders such as the International Monetary Fund to cut deficits, and a hard-pressed population reeling from the soaring cost of living.
Members of the protest movement, which has no official leaders and largely organises via social media, have rejected Ruto's appeals for dialogue - even after he abandoned his proposed tax rises.
""People are dying in the streets and the only thing he can talk about is money. We are not money. We are people. We are human beings,"" protester Milan Waudo told Reuters in Mombasa.
""He needs to care about his people, because if he can't care about his people then we don't need him in that chair.""
Other protests took place in Kisumu, Nakuru, Kajiado, Migori, Mlolongo and Rongo, according to images broadcast on Kenyan television. In the southwestern town of Migori, protesters set tyres on fire.
Activists blamed Tuesday's violence on infiltrators they said had been unleashed by the government to discredit their movement, and said it was now time for protesters to disperse.
""Good people. Let’s go home. As usual the government has let goons take over, loot, and burn property again,"" one of the most prominent activists, Boniface Mwangi, wrote on X.
The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNHCR) says 39 Kenyans have been killed in demonstrations and clashes with police since June 18. Most of the deaths took place on June 25 when officers opened fire near parliament where some protesters tried to storm the building to prevent lawmakers from voting on the tax hikes.
""We are determined to push for the president's resignation,"" said Ojango Omondi, an activist in Nairobi.
The authorities appealed for calm.
""It's a beautiful day to choose patriotism. A beautiful day to choose peace, order and the sanctity of our nationhood,"" State House communications director Gerald Bitok wrote on X on Tuesday, adding in Swahili: ""Violence is not patriotism.""
Opposition leader Raila Odinga, runner-up in the last four presidential elections, backed the protesters though they have called on politicians to keep out of it.
""The youth have given our country its last best chance,"" Odinga's ODM party said in a statement.
""We either seize it and swim with it by implementing all their demands, or we ignore it and sink the country altogether.""
The protests, which started as an online outpouring of anger over nearly $2.7 billion of tax increases in a proposed finance bill, have grown into a nationwide movement against corruption and misgovernance.
Ruto has directed the treasury to come up with ways to cut spending to fill a budget gap left by the withdrawal of the tax plans, and also said more borrowing would be required.
Veteran anti-corruption activist John Githongo told Reuters that while Ruto had addressed the nation and media, ""there isn't an indication that he wants to take action"" on protesters' demands, including firing corrupt officials.
""There hasn't been any indication by the government that they are going to take the calls to deal with corruption seriously,"" he said.
The protests had been mostly peaceful until June 25, when some demonstrators briefly stormed parliament and set part of it ablaze, prompting police to open fire.
Ruto has defended the actions of the police and blamed the violence on ""criminals"" who had hijacked the demonstrations.

Colombia marched into the quarter-finals of the Copa America on Friday with a confident 3-0 victory over Costa Rica in Arizona.
Goals from Luis Diaz, Davinson Sanchez and Jhon Cordoba sealed all three points for the Colombians, who are now guaranteed a top-two finish in Group D.
Colombia will qualify for the quarter-finals as group winners if they can secure at least a point against Brazil - a 4-1 winner over Paraguay in Friday's other Copa contest - in their final group game next Tuesday.
The Colombians will head into that game brimming with confidence after extending their unbeaten streak to 25 games at Glendale's State Farm Stadium on Friday.
Nestor Lorenzo's well-organised side have not lost since a defeat to Argentina in February 2022, and never looked in danger of changing that Friday.
Liverpool star Diaz opened the scoring from the penalty spot in the 31st minute after Costa Rica goalkeeper Patrick Sequeira inexplicably crashed into Cordoba on the edge of the area.
Diaz stepped up to smash an emphatic spot-kick into the top corner.
Colombia almost doubled their tally on 37 minutes, with veteran midfielder James Rodriguez picking out Diaz at the back post.
Diaz poked a cross into the six-yard area but center-back Sanchez just couldn't get a touch to guide the ball into the net.
Sanchez made no such mistake in the 59th minute, however, as he glanced in Jhon Arias's cross from the left to make it 2-0.
Cordoba then grabbed Colombia's third on 62 minutes with the best goal of the game.
An exquisite through ball from Rodriguez split the Costa Rica defence and sent Cordoba racing in on goal, with the 31-year-old whipping a shot across goal into the far corner.
In Las Vegas, the Brazilians - coming off a 0-0 draw with Costa Rica - jumped to a 3-0 halftime edge over Paraguay on the way to victory after squandering a golden chance to open the scoring.
Paraguay's Adrian Cubas, who would receive a red card in the 81st minute, committed a foul in the penalty area, but Brazil's Lucas Paqueta missed from the spot in the 31st minute.
But Paqueta delivered an assist to set up Vincius Junior's goal in the 35th minute that gave Brazil a 1-0 lead.
Savinho doubled Brazil's lead with a goal in the 43rd minute and Vincius Junior gave Brazil a 3-0 half-time lead in the fifth minute of stoppage time, racing in behind the play and delivering a right-footed shot just inside the left post.
Paraguay answered in the 48th minute on a goal by Omar Alderete but Paqueta scored on a redemption penalty kick in the 65th minute for a 4-1 Brazil lead and that's how it finished.

FKF-Premier
League debutants Murang'a SEAL chairperson Robert Macharia has lauded
his side for maintaining their top-flight status, terming it an achievement.
The St. Sebastian Park-based stable was promoted to the Premier after finishing second
behind winners Shabana FC in the National Super League (NSL) in the 2022/23
season.
Speaking
to Citizen Digital, Macharia who doubles up as FKF NEC Member for Murang'a
County says the team achieved the goal they had set at the beginning of the
just concluded season.
""Remaining
in the League for us (Murang'a SEAL) is quite an achievement. When we started
the season, the boys were under instructions to do anything within their means
to have us remain in the League.
And I
think we have achieved this. We wanted to remain in the League and it has
happened."" Said Macharia.
""Finishing
13th in the top tier League in your debut and managing to get points from
experienced and formidable teams that we faced at the tail end of the league
just credible.
“I can
only give the boys and their coach a pat on the shoulder."" He added.
Overall,
in their debut season in the Premier League, Murang'a SEAL won nine matches,
drew eleven while losing 14, a record the chairman says must be improved next
season.
Under
the tutelage of veteran tactician Juma Abdallah, who was appointed in January,
2024, SEAL won three matches, drawing five and losing five.
The
highest victory being a 4–0 win over Nzoia Sugar, who were eventually
relegated.
Before
he replaced the then embattled Evans Nyaberi, the Murang’a-based side had
endured 11 winless matches, and the notable change that he (Abdallah) made was
to sign experienced midfielder Dennis Odhiambo, who reversed his retirement
decision and installed him as team captain, taking over from long serving Peter
Mwaura who was relegated to first team assistant captain.
According
to Macharia, they have learnt some great lessons that are going to help them
plan properly for the next season.
""We
have had ups and downs but in the coming seasons, we will be a force to reckon
with because we have now tasted the League, we have had a bit of experience and
next season and others the sky is the limit"" he stated.
The
FKF-Premier League for the 2024–25 season is expected to begin in August, 2024.

Ulinzi Starlets are now ready to face Kibera
Soccer Ladies in the FKF Women’s Cup final scheduled for Wednesday, July 10,
2024, at the Police Sacco Stadium.
The soldiers held their final preparations on
Tuesday at the Ulinzi Sports Complex, and are fired up for the final as they
seek to win the title for the third time in a row.
Ulinzi advanced to the final after edging out
Kenya Police Bullets 4-2 via post-match penalties on May 4, 2024, at the
Dandora Stadium, while their opponents overcame Bernard Kitolo’s Zetech Sparks
2-1 in the other semi-final.
Speaking to Citizen Digital, the soldiers head
coach Joseph Wambua Mwanza said it is all system go ahead of the final as he
urged his charges to ensure they put their best foot forward.
“We have done our training early today and I
can see the morale is very high ahead of the final. I have no injuries doubt
and what I’m expecting is nothing but a win. We narrowly missed the premier league
title but we can’t let the (FKF) Cup go,” said Mwanza.
“As usual, I’m urging all our fans to come out
in large numbers at Police Sacco Stadium to support us and I promise we will
not let them down,” he added.
Elsewhere, Kibera Soccer Ladies did their final
preparations on Tuesday morning at Moi Girls High School in Kibera and just
like Ulinzi, they are looking forward to a win.
“Our trainings have been well and I’m impressed
by the morale in the team. I understand beating Ulinzi will not be a walk in
the park but we will give it our all to ensure we write history by winning the
title for the first time ever,” said Kibera head coach David Vijago.
The final was earlier slated for June 16, 2024,
but had to pushed back to allow the national U17 side, Junior Starlets, play
their World Cup qualifier matches for the FIFA U17 Women’s World Cup.
At the same time, Zetech Sparks and Kenya Police
Bullets will face off in the third-place playoff, as a curtain raiser to the
final.

NBA superstars LeBron James and Stephen Curry are ""excited"" by the prospect of joining forces as the United States chases a fifth straight gold medal at next month's Olympics, USA coach Steve Kerr said Thursday.
Los Angeles Lakers superstar James and Golden State Warriors ace Curry will finally line up in a USA team for the first time in Paris after facing off against each other in 52 games during a 15-year rivalry in the NBA.
USA and Golden State coach Kerr said Thursday the two basketball icons were relishing the prospect of teaming up.
""LeBron and Steph are really excited to play together,"" Kerr said. ""I've talked to both of them about this idea of being together after going against one another with such high stakes over the years.
""They obviously fit really well together. I think the idea of Steph playing off the ball and LeBron pushing it in transition, that's pretty intriguing.""
Curry has a 29-23 winning record against James in the NBA, with a 17-11 record in playoff meetings.
Last season, the duo featured in one of the games of the year, combining for 82 points in a double-overtime thriller which saw the Lakers narrowly defeat Golden State 145-144.
""It's something I'll be able to talk about with my grandkids, about being able to compete with one of the greatest players to ever play the game,"" James said of Curry after that instant classic.
Kerr said Curry and James will aim to gel over the course of a training camp which begins in Las Vegas next week before a warm-up game against Canada on July 10.
The USA squad also has pre-Olympic games in Abu Dhabi and London before their opening group game of the Olympics against Serbia on July 28 in Lille.
""They're really excited to compete together for the first time and to find over the course of the practices and the friendlies some of the nuances that they can really exploit and explore, to just to see where they can have an impact for each other,"" Kerr said.
James and Curry are part of one of the most powerful USA teams ever to take part in the Olympics, with a roster that also includes the likes of Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis, Anthony Edwards, Jayson Tatum and Joel Embiid.
""Our roster is obviously laden with stars and players who have accomplished so much,"" Kerr said. ""And what I love about these guys is they want to accomplish more.
""They want to win an Olympic gold medal, and that's why they all signed up for this.""

Kenya Police Bullets Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chris Oguso, has said that they will use their end of the season league match against Bunyore Starlets as a friendly ahead of the CAF Women’s Champions League CECAFA qualifiers slated for August in Ethiopia.
The law enforcers are poised for coronation on Wednesday, June 26, 2024, as the 2023/24 season culminates.
The match against Bunyore, which was earlier scheduled to be played at Mumboha Stadium in Vihiga, has been moved to Mamboleo Stadium in Kisumu.
“I congratulate the ladies for winning the title without conceding a single match. Going to our final match to us will be as a training being that we already won the league earlier enough. Our first Cecafa match is slated for August 17, 2024, and it's not that far, we need to hit the preparation camp immediately after the league ends,” said Oguso.
“I can say the title win has been made possible due to proper coordination of the technical bench headed by Coach Bedine Odemba. Also the Kenya Police Service has given the girls maximum support and we are looking forward to continue with the same spirit ahead of Cecafa and the next season,” he added.
This is their first title since their renaming from Thika Queens, and they have amassed 46 points from 21 matches so far. The second place has been secured by Vihiga Queens, while Ulinzi Starlets have bagged the third place.
Gaspo Women and Trans Nzoia Falcons have been relegated, while Soccer Assassins and Zetech Sparks are vying to avoid the axe.
Currently, Zetech Sparks are three points ahead of Soccer Assassins and have a (-10) goal difference.
With no more games to play, they hope Assassins do not win their match at Wolves Den, Kajiado. A 7-0 win for Assassins against fourth-placed Kibera Soccer Ladies FC is the only way for them to secure their place in the FKF-WPL 2024/25 season.
The race for the golden oot has also heated up over the season, with Vihiga Queens' Tumaini Waliaula leading with 15 goals, followed by Kenya Police Bullets' Purity Alukwe with 14 goals.
Rebecca Okwaro has 13 goals, and Nancy Atako has amassed 12 goals.
As the 2023/24 season of league draws to a close, all eyes are on Kenya Police Bullets for their imminent coronation.
While they celebrate their championship, the battle at the other end of the table will be intense.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/white-house-says-zero-chance-biden-will-withdraw-n345212,"White House says zero chance Biden will withdraw
Published on: July 04, 2024 01:57 (EAT)
U.S. President Joe Biden delivers remarks after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on former U.S. President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's bid for immunity from federal prosecution for 2020 election subversion, at the White House in Washington, U.S., July 1, 2024. REUTERS
Joe Biden is ""absolutely not"" pulling out of the US presidential race, his spokeswoman said Wednesday, as pressure mounted following his disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump.
Panic has gripped his Democratic Party in the wake of last week's TV debate, and internal rumblings about finding a replacement candidate before November's election have been amplified by polls showing Trump extending his lead.
The New York Times and CNN reported that Biden, 81, had acknowledged to a key ally that his reelection bid was on the line if he failed to quickly reassure the public that he was still up to the job.
White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre rejected those reports outright, insisting Biden has no intention of withdrawing.
""The president is clear-eyed and he is staying in the race,"" she told reporters.
Biden told a call with campaign and party staffers that he is going nowhere.
""I'm in this race to the end and we're going to win because when Democrats unite, we will always win. Just as we beat Donald Trump in 2020, we're going to beat him again in 2024,"" he said, according to a source close to the campaign.
He repeated that message in an emergency meeting with Democratic governors, who pledged their continued support, attendees said afterward.
""As the president continued to tell us, and show us, that he was all in... we said that we would stand with him,"" Maryland Governor Wes Moore, seen as a rising star and potential future presidential candidate, told reporters alongside Minnesota's Tim Walz and Kathy Hochul of New York.
Walz said Biden was ""fit to serve.""
Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who also attended the meeting at the White House and is seen as one of the top picks to replace Biden if he should drop out, said on social media platform X that ""he is in it to win it and I support him.""
Biden has admitted he performed poorly in the debate, and was blunt in a radio interview recorded Wednesday with Wisconsin's Civic Media.
""I screwed up. I made a mistake. That's 90 minutes on stage. Look at what I've done in 3.5 years,"" he said.
He echoed that sentiment in an interview with Pennsylvania's WURD radio on Thursday, saying ""I had a bad debate.""
The Biden campaign has been desperate to reassure Democratic donors and voters that the president's performance against Trump was a one-off.
But party figures have voiced bafflement over what they see as deflection and excuses from the president and his aides.
Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, one of the Democratic Party's biggest donors, told the New York Times that Biden should withdraw.
""Biden needs to step aside to allow a vigorous Democratic leader to beat Trump and keep us safe and prosperous,"" he said in an email to the paper.
The concern was compounded by a New York Times poll conducted after the debate that showed Trump with his biggest lead ever over Biden -- 49 percent to 43 percent of likely voters.
It wasn't until Wednesday -- six days after the debate -- that Biden completed a round of calls with Democratic congressional leaders, and staffers have also voiced consternation over the glacial pace of the outreach.
""We are getting to the point where it may not have been the debate that did him in, but the aftermath of how they've handled it,"" a senior Democratic operative told Washington political outlet Axios.
Biden may be tested on his ability to think on his feet when he sits with ABC News on Friday for his first television interview since the debate, and he will also hit the swing states of Wisconsin and Pennsylvania in the coming days.
The president has cited fatigue as a new explanation for his poor debate showing, saying that he was unwise to travel ""around the world a couple times"" before the debate.
But he had been back in the United States for nearly two weeks and spent two days relaxing and six days preparing before the debate.
Democratic lawmakers have begun to go public with their doubts. Arizona congressman Raul Grijalva became the second sitting Democrat to call on Biden to drop out.
""If he's the candidate, I'm going to support him, but I think that this is an opportunity to look elsewhere,"" Grijalva said, according to the Times.
In the street where the president grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, there was sympathy for Biden -- but no campaign signs for either candidate.
""I was embarrassed for him. I felt he didn't feel well and he probably shouldn't have gone on the stage,"" said 73-year-old Jamie Hayes.

On CASs, the court declared themselves on that and we have respected that. We are not going to appoint an CS until our economy can sustain that,"" Ruto added.
The president was responding to concerns about a group of government officials walking around in flashy clothes and carrying wads of cash to harambees.
He also revealed that he has spoken with UDA MPs, who are considering doing away with harambees, particularly in churches.
""We are actually going to do away with harambees, because when a junior state officers donates Ksh20 million in a harambee, there is something fundamentally wrong. That is wrong,"" Ruto asserted.
Concerns have been raised about MPs like Kapseret's Oscar Sudi distributing millions of shillings in church harambees.
Sudi is a close ally of Ruto.

Migori County Secretary Oscar Olima said he has received the resignation letter from the 19 employees who have opted to leave the services rather than waiting for the county and other relevant bodies to take action.
Olima said out of the 93 workers who are either having fake primary and secondary certificates, 25 of them have written to the county public service board requesting an opportunity to give their side of the story.
He said the board has given them an opportunity to defend themselves before taking the next course of action.
Migori county secretary said they are also investigating county workers with questionable college certificates in the ongoing purge on fake academic papers.
Olima said there is no witch hunt in the exercise as the action has been informed by the audit report compiled by the Human Resource Audit Institute back in 2023 and the staff headcount report done by the county government.
He said the fake primary and secondary school certificates were confirmed by the National Examination Council that went through the academic papers for over 2700 county employees.
The county secretary said all the 93 county workers with fake academic papers have been removed from the payroll even as the public service board gives them an opportunity to tell their side of the story.

Published on: June 29, 2024 09:27 (EAT)
This combination of pictures created on June 27, 2024 shows (L) England's head coach Gareth Southgate reacting from the sidelines during the UEFA Euro 2024 Group C football match between Denmark and England at the Frankfurt Arena in Frankfurt am Main on June 20, 2024 and Slovakia's Italian head coach Francesco Calzona reacting from the sidelines during the UEFA Euro 2024 Group E football match between Slovakia and Ukraine at the Duesseldorf Arena in Duesseldorf on June 21, 2024.

England manager Gareth Southgate has pinpointed expectation for the festering unease among his side's travelling support but demand on the Three Lions to deliver at Euro 2024 has only risen after landing in the soft side of the draw.
Southgate's men begin what they hope will be a road to Berlin for the final on July 14 against Slovakia in Gelsenkirchen on Sunday.
A rematch of the Euro 2020 final with Italy or Switzerland would then await in the quarters, while Austria, Turkey, the Netherlands or Romania are potential semi-final opponents.
There has been little in England's performances in Germany so far to justify their hype as pre-tournament favourites.
But with Germany, France, Spain and Portugal all on the other side of the draw, the pressure has intensified on a richly-talented squad to finally start performing as a team.
""If people are being negative, it's only because they expect a lot from you, which is a positive thing,"" said Newcastle winger Anthony Gordon, who could be one of the changes Southgate turns to.
""If we want that to stop, we just need to perform and give people what they want to see.""
Despite topping Group C, England have managed only two goals in their opening three games.
The quartet of Phil Foden, Jude Bellingham, Bukayo Saka and Harry Kane combined for 114 goals in club football in the 2023/24 campaign.
But together they have been a disjointed attacking unit that Southgate is under huge pressure to shake up in Gelsenkirchen.
Foden has rejoined the squad after flying back home to attend the birth of his third child.
However, his lack of time on the training field this week may mean the Premier League's player of the year is the fall guy to try and balance the attack.
England's lack of width on the left has been exposed by Southgate having no natural left-back available due to Luke Shaw's injury and Foden's tendency to drift inside.
- Gordon backs himself to shine -
Gordon looks set to be handed his chance despite having just a few minutes action in the tournament so far.
""My main strength is that I'm very direct. I'm obviously quick, so I'm a nightmare for anyone I play against,"" Gordon told reporters on Friday to push his case for a first competitive England start.
""I'm not a very safe player, I'm always going for it, I'm always trying to put people on the back foot.
""I think with the players we've got, the likes of H (Kane), who likes to drop deep, I think I add a different element to the team.""
Kobbie Mainoo is expected to start in midfield after the 19-year-old made an impressive impact in his second half appearance against Slovenia.
Southgate also faces a clamour to unleash Cole Palmer.
The Chelsea playmaker, who scored 26 goals at club level last season, caught the eye in his late cameo against Slovenia and had England's only shot on target of the second half.
So far Southgate has remained steadfast and stubborn in his team selection, making only one change to his starting line-up as Conor Gallagher replaced Trent Alexander-Arnold in midfield for the third match.
A similar approach at the weekend risks further antagonising a fan base that threw beer cups at their coach after the Slovenia stalemate.
Southgate can point to his experience at negotiating his nation through the highs and lows of major tournaments.
England also scored only two goals in the group stage of the last Euros before progressing to a first major tournament final in 55 years.
However, it is the shades of Euro 2016 that will send shivers down the spines of England fans heading to Gelsenkirchen.
Eight years ago Roy Hodgson's side also stumbled their way through the group phase with five points only to be handed a seemingly kind draw against Iceland.
What followed was arguably the most embarrassing night in English football history as the tiny island nation in their first every major tournament pulled off a shock 2-1 win.
Matching that nadir is what England's current crop risk if they do not click through the gears come Sunday.

will be a good build to the HSBC world sevens series which the
team returns to next season.
“Our main focus now is the Olympics which we will also use

injury but now I’m glad to have this chance. I’m sure we will be in the
podium with the great squad that we have currently,” stated the captain.

https://www.citizen.digital/wananchi-reporting/black-tax-underemployment-why-diaspora-is-participating-in-protests-n345133,"‘Black tax, underemployment’: Why Diaspora is participating in protests
Some have marched to the Kenyan embassies, while others taking to the street to first call for the rejection of the Finance Bill, and now an end to corruption and austerity measures.
Some of countries where Kenyans have participated in protests include parts of the US, UK, Germany, Australia, France and the Netherlands.
However, what do the protests mean to Kenyans living abroad? Why are they taking to the streets?
These are some of the questions that were answered during a Citizen Digital X Space discussion on Tuesday evening on the impact of the anti-Finance Bill protests.
Speaking on how Kenya found itself in the current situation, Mudge Rulf, a Kenyan living in Germany and the CEO of the Diaspora Network Hub, said that majority of Kenyans living abroad would like to retire back home, but the situation in terms of high taxes and corruption makes it a bleak option.
“If you take the example of overtaxation, when you increase the taxes back home but you're not providing an enabling environment and people are jobless, you are indirectly increasing the black tax in the diaspora,” she said.
“People cannot even start up their businesses. So that is impacting us directly. Another thing that is impacting the diaspora directly is lack of a proper functioning statutory health insurance like the NHIF that's currently now being transferred to another program and we’ve seen there's a lot of corruption going on. When this system is not functioning, then the diaspora have to pay for their sick relatives in private hospitals. And that is to the tune of sometimes Ksh. 1 million per month, especially if, the people are say in ICU. And for ICU, the hospital beds at the public hospitals are not easy to get. They're always just reserved.”
On his part, Prof David Monda, a professor in political science and researcher, put the current challenges facing the country in three categories: the crisis of legitimacy, the mismatch between domestic needs and international ambitions on the part of the government, and the issue of fiscal autonomy.
He said, “Under crisis of legitimacy, issues like fiscal mismanagement, questions of corruption, failure of the Kenya Kwanza administration in terms of campaign promises, taxation and the IMF are some of the issues. There are questions about exactly who wrote this bill and for what reasons.”
Monda pointed to the anger over extrajudicial abductions and the deployment of the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) on the ground.
He spoke to the question of President William Ruto’s recent visit to the US.
“His administration wants to punch way above its weight in terms of pleasing the US, getting into alliances with, Western partners. And we see that in terms of, the correlation, the associations, and partnerships with the IMF, but also with, our police who are being sent to Haiti. And that ties in with the domestic because when we think about Kenya police being sent to Haiti, this is very much tied with the Biden administration's plan for global governance. But it directly affects Kenyans in terms of our national security because we have gaps in security. We have many areas of Kenya, which, you are very insecure,” Monda said
Touching on the issue of austerity or lack thereof, Monda said the government’s borrowing has implications. “There are no free lunches in international affairs,” he said.
“I think this is really creating a lot of the challenges we have on the streets in Nairobi because this Chinese and American debt has to be paid somehow. How does that happen? You raise taxes and you cut services. And this is also very problematic… So I think there's a there's a very interesting correlation here between what's happening abroad, what William Ruto is trying to do, and his image abroad.
The speakers also brought out the challenge of many Kenyans going to work abroad in jobs that are below their training.
“We don't want Kenyans coming here to start harvesting strawberries,” Rulf said.

https://www.citizen.digital/wananchi-reporting/cosmetic-austerity-measures-govt-urged-to-implement-genuine-cost-cutting-programmes-n345661,"'Cosmetic' austerity measures? Gov’t urged to implement genuine cost cutting programmes
During a Citizen Digital X Space discussion on the austerity agenda, panelists broke down the main criticisms many Kenyans had against public spending and what wananchi expectations are from the government’s austerity measures.
President William Ruto last Friday announced a raft of austerity measures across various government agencies to align the country’s budgetary expenditure to the implications of the withdrawn Finance Bill, 2024.
President Ruto, addressing the nation from State House in Nairobi announced that at least 47 government bodies with almost similar mandates will now be dissolved and their staff absorbed into parent ministries.
This, he said, will enable the government to recoup funds previously used for their operational and maintenance expenses.
Ruto also said that the decision to fill the positions of Chief Administrative Secretary (CAS) effectively stands suspended, further that the number of advisers attached to the Executive will be slashed by 50 per cent.
The Head of State went ahead to halt the purchase of new government motor vehicles for 12 months, providing an exception only to security agencies, while also stating that a new framework for the transportation of public officers will be developed.
These were some of the austerity measures announced.
However, Benard Njiiri, a senior research analyst at the Institute of Public Finance (IPF), said, “As we talk about these austerity measures, they should not be, mere cosmetic. There has to be sincerity. There has to be political goodwill. When we mean cutting travel expenses, for example, it should happen.”
“We already witnessed that it can actually happen and it did during the COVID time. If you look at the control of budget reports, we were able to reduce travel expenses significantly. So it should even happen now. Those trainings that can be done at the Kenya School of Government here in Nairobi should not be taken to Mombasa,” he said.
He continued, “When Gen Z says, we want now action, not mere talk, that should be the tone from now onward.”
On his, part, John Thomi, a project officer at the National Taxpayers Association (NTA), said Kenyans are looking for genuine change and not just mere talk.
He said, “When you talk about austerity measures, there are other components that, go hand in hand with implementation. For instance, there is a need for redistribution and, taking the resources to the needful sectors. There is an issue of a stimulus package because as of now we are talking of many people being unemployed… When it comes to engaging the public and listening to the public, that's where we have a point of departure between policy makers within government and, sometimes also the legislature and the general public.”
Thomi continued, “The public has risen and citizens are unhappy with how the government has been using the taxes that are collected. When we talk about CASs, suspending their appointment does not really, speak to the expenses that we are to incur. When you talk about the 47 state corporations, they've not been able to list them so that we can be able to comment. So if at all it's another process that will go on for another year, then the expenses will still be there.”

Published on: June 30, 2024 06:10 (EAT)
One person was killed and five others wounded in northeastern France when several masked gunmen opened fire at a wedding ceremony, police sources said on Sunday.
Sources suggested that the attack in the northeastern city of Thionville was linked to a settling of scores between drug traffickers.
The shooting took place at a reception hall overnight Saturday to Sunday, with around a hundred people in attendance.
Two people were seriously injured and one of them was in a critical condition.
The perpetrators of the shooting have fled the scene.
""It was during a wedding,"" a police source said.
""At a quarter past one in the morning, a group of people went outside to smoke in front of the hall, and then three heavily armed men arrived and opened fire in their direction.""
The assailants arrived in a 4X4 vehicle, ""probably a BMW"", the source said.
It was not immediately clear where the vehicle had come from. Thionville is located close to the borders of Luxembourg and Germany.
Members of law enforcement believe that a settling of scores linked to drug trafficking was behind the violence.
""The wedding was not targeted as such, it was people who were at the wedding,"" the source said.
A glass door pierced with bullet holes could be seen at the scene on Sunday morning.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/over-1500-people-in-kirinyaga-get-free-eye-treatment-surgeries-n344563,"Over 1,500 people in Kirinyaga get free eye treatment, surgeries
This comes even as medics raised concern over a rise in number of people having eye complications in Mt. Kenya region. This rise has been attributed to increase in non-communicable diseases.
During the three day medical camp organized by the County Government of Kirinyaga, Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Corporation (REREC) and Kenya Society for the Blind (KSB), 36 people underwent cataract surgeries to remove clouding of the lens of the eye.
One of the patients had lived with cataract on both eyes which had cased clouded vision for five years making it difficult for the victim to see clearly.
Patients were issued with glasses, medication and white canes for free.
Speaking during the medical camp, County Executive Committee Member (CECM) for Medical Services, Public Health, and Sanitation George Karoki, blamed rise in eye ailments in Mt. Kenya to increase in non-communicable diseases like diabetes, cancer and hypertension.
""This particular trend of rise in non-communicable diseases is causing a big problem of the eye. We are very grateful for this particular support from these organizations because it has helped us reach out to more people who had not gotten treatment for eye problems,” he said.
He emphasized that Governor Anne Waiguru has prioritized healthcare as one of her deliverables and this what informed initiative to set up an ultra-modern eye unit at the Kerugoya County Referral Hospital.
“We have invested in establishing a state-of-the-art eye clinic complete with staff, an ophthalmologist, and a fully equipped theatre for eye problems,"" he added.
Karoki urged residents to undergo regular eye checkups, noting that early detection and diagnosis could lead to quicker treatment and prevent further complications.
The Kenya Society for the Blind (KSB) lauded efforts by for its efforts to offer specialized eye treatment so as to help in the eliminating avoidable blindness.
KSB Chief Executive Officer Samson Waweru said establishment of an eye unit at the Kerugoya County Referral Hospital has ensured people facing eye problems do not have to travel to Nairobi for specialist treatment.
Waweru said about 10 million Kenyans are at a risk of getting blind, however, 85 to 90 percent of those who are likely to go blind have treatable cases if they are screened earlier.
He said the lead cause of blindness in the country is uncorrected deflective errors, cataracts, trachoma and other lifestyle diseases.
“The statistics of visually impaired people according to the 2019 census stands at 334,000 legally blind individuals across the country. But the concerning statistics from the Ministry of Health is that 10 million Kenyans could wake up tomorrow to find themselves blind. This means that one out of every four Kenyans could face blindness, which is why this medical camp is crucial, as 85-90% of these cases are treatable,” he emphasized.
REREC Board Director Mark Nderitu explained that while REREC's primary mandate is rural electrification, their involvement in the medical camp is part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts.
“REREC is running 322 electrification projects across nine counties in the Mt. Kenya region, targeting to electrify over 15,500 households. In Kirinyaga, REREC has 20 projects aiming to electrify 1,250 households,” he said.
Nderitu said expansion of electricity connection to unreached areas will help eliminate use of firewood for cooking and kerosene for lighting in homes.
Studies have linked inhaling of smoke that comes from cooking with firewood, charcoal, and kerosene as a health risk and major contributor to respiratory diseases, natal complications, eye problems, heart diseases.
He expressed gratitude to the Kirinyaga County Government for partnering with REREC, saying, “we are pleased with the massive turnout and the opportunity to impact the lives of the community.”
Lydia Mugo, a 78-year-old resident of Murinduko area in Mwea East, expressed her gratitude for the camp.
""I have never seen a free eye medical camp offering surgeries. We are thankful to have these free services through the Kirinyaga County Government and REREC. I have been attended to and my eyes can now see clearly,"" she said.
Stephen Njeru, a 70-year-old from Kanjo Sub-location, shared his relief after undergoing a cataract surgery at the camp.
""I had cataract issues and needed surgery and medication. I struggled for over 3 years and was told I needed Ksh. 70,000 for treatment. Yesterday, I came to this medical camp, had the surgery done for free and now though the eye hasn’t healed completed, I have started seeing clearly images than before. I can see well, and the problem is gone. I am grateful,"" Njeru stated.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/can-you-make-money-from-football-betting-myths-vs-reality-n344843,"Can you make money from football betting? Myths vs. Reality
Most people are drawn to football betting by the fantasy of making a profit and being part of the game being played. However, it’s essential to differentiate between the reality and myths associated with football betting.
Managing your expectations: What being profitable means
If you’re still wondering whether football betting is profitable, then the short answer is yes. However, being profitable in football betting is a relatively variable term. What you might consider to be a worthwhile return, might only be a spare change to another bettor.
That said, football bettors need to understand that profitability isn’t always about hitting the jackpot or a luxurious life. It’s more about strategy, discipline, and patience when finding valuable bets to remain profitable in the long run. That means consistently generating surplus income from your initial bankroll.
Strategies don’t work: Football betting is all about luck
You might have watched a football game where one team dominates throughout the match, but somehow end up losing. That makes many beginners believe that football betting is a luck-based activity like roulette, but that couldn’t be further from the truth.
While football betting has an element of luck and any team stands a chance to win, you need to do some research about the game and leverage your existing knowledge about the teams. You can start your analysis by checking original tips from SportyTrader’s football experts and go through recent performance checking for trends to leverage.
In other words, successful football bettors must have a working strategy to remain profitable. You simply can’t rely on luck in the long run, especially with accumulator bets, although you might be lucky enough to win a few singles.
Odds don’t matter if you pick more winners
Although it might seem logical to just ignore the odds and concentrate on picking winners, this kind of thinking only makes sportsbooks thrive. Since there’s no guaranteed way of always picking winners, disregarding the odds will spell doom for your betting adventure. Look at it this way: even Europe’s top teams occasionally lose to underdogs.
To remain profitable in football betting, it’s not always a matter of how often your bets win. It’s about the amount of money you get paid when your bet wins. As such, odds are crucial in football betting as they help you identify valuable options.
High odds never win
While some football bettors shy away from high odds due to the perceived high risk associated, it doesn’t mean they never win. The odds simply reflect a team’s probability of winning the event, but they don’t hinder a team’s ability to outrank their opponents. Inevitably an unusual upset will happen, but that’s normal in football.
Regardless of the increased risk, high odds can also win. The secret is that betting on high football odds requires more tolerance and you can go long without winning. However, if you carefully analyze an outcome and find value in high odds, you can get huge rewards. That’s because value can occur with short and long odds.

The tragic event took a devastating turn when the young girl later committed suicide, leaving behind a poignant note expressing her shame after being publicly undressed and flogged by the chief for being at home instead of in school.
The incident, which occurred in Amabuko Village, Nyaribari Masaba, Kisii County, has sparked widespread public outrage over the conduct of the uniformed government officer.
The family of Jared Omari, visibly distraught, gathered outside their grass-thatched house in deep reflection following the sudden death of their first-born daughter.
According to Enock Nyariki, the deceased's uncle, they confronted Assistant Chief Simon Osano after the brutal punishment was meted out.
The deceased's mother, Joyce Bonareri, explained that her daughter had returned home to collect personal belongings, including sanitary towels, before intending to return to school. She had assumed the administrator's summons were to assist her with these needs.
During the incident on Wednesday, both the father and daughter were subjected to severe corporal punishment.
Jared Omari, the father, recounted the ordeal where he was whipped after his daughter before receiving further punishment.
Social media has been ablaze with calls for the immediate arrest of the newly appointed assistant chief, condemning his actions as excessive and unjust.
Wyclife Siocha, MCA Ichuni, described the incident as torture, emphasizing the severity of the punishment inflicted on a child in such a manner.
Masaba South security officials, led by Area Deputy County Commissioner Jane Chabira, have vowed to leave no stone unturned in ensuring justice prevails. They have collected statements from the affected family members and pledged to pursue the case diligently.
The body of Bonareri has been transferred to Ichuni Hospital's morgue pending an autopsy. The family, amidst their profound grief, has appealed to authorities to thoroughly investigate the matter and ensure justice is served, attributing the tragic ordeal to their impoverished circumstances.
The pain and sorrow in the Omari family are immeasurable, underscoring the urgent need for a thorough investigation and accountability for the tragic events that transpired.

Youths assembled at the public grounds to honour those who were killed during the anti-government protests.
Speaking on Monday MP Mulu stated that youths exhibited orderly conduct and met for a noble cause.
“There was no violence, you could see they were armed with their mobile phones water bottles, and some with masks,” said Mulu.
“They conducted themselves in a way that at the end of the day they went home, nobody was hurt no stone was thrown no shop was broken into.”
“All we have been seeing last week was other people who came and pretended to be part of GenZ. When they came to the streets without anyone else interfering with their arrangements they were very peaceful,” he said.
The legislator also called on all parties involved in ironing out the demands made by the youth to find a proper way of ensuring that they are heard.
“We would imagine the ways we have been doing things you go throwing teargas, police are there it is outdated. We need to think of a new way of engaging these young people so that we understand them,” he said.
“I think this new idea of talking to them and trying to understand them is very critical if we have to move forward as a country.”
The MP stated that it is time for the country to take a reset despite the various political stances people may have.
This was also followed by demands made by the youth calling for austerity measures and accountability by the government which forced President Ruto to announce a raft of austerity measures across various government agencies.
Addressing the nation from State House in Nairobi on Friday afternoon, Ruto announced that at least 47 government bodies with almost similar mandates will now be dissolved and their staff absorbed into parent ministries.
He also suspended the decision to fill the position of Chief Administrative Secretary (CAS) and that the number of advisers attached to the Executive will be slashed by 50 per cent.
Calls for the ousting of President Ruto are still gaining prominence as many are asking him to hold authorities accountable for the deaths recorded during the protests.
The state claims that 25 people have been killed and 400 have been injured but the Kenya Human Rights Commission (KHRC) says that at least 43 people were killed and over 600 were injured in varying degrees.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/no-agreement-to-return-uks-ksh38b-rwanda-says-as-asylum-deal-backfires-n345581,"No agreement to return UK's Ksh.38B; Rwanda says as asylum deal backfires
In a video posted by the state-owned Rwanda Broadcasting Agency, the government spokesperson Alain Mukuralinda revealed that there is no clause in the agreement that talked about refunding the amount in case either party wants to withdraw.
“We had an agreement. Both parties signed, it became an international agreement, we start implementing it, then after that you want out … best of luck,” the spokesperson said.
“Within the agreement there was no clause regarding reimbursement… it never stated that the money would be refunded.""
In his first press conference, newly elected UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer termed the scheme as a gimmick and confirmed that his administration would get rid of the policy.
""The Rwanda scheme was dead and buried before it started. it's never been a deterrent. I'm not prepared to continue with gimmicks that don't act as a deterrent,"" he explained.
The agreement was introduced in April 2022 under former Prime Minister Boris Johnson to address the huge influx of people reaching the UK without authorisation by crossing the border in small boats.
As part of the deal, the UK channeled Ksh38.6 billion to Rwanda to realise the policy. It, however, received a lot of backlash from critics who alleged that the proposal violated human rights. In November 2023, the UK Supreme Court declared the policy as unlawful, citing that Rwanda was not a safe country for asylum seekers.
In response to the court's decision, the government published a new treaty with Rwanda which introduced additional security measures and a legislation which declared Rwanda as a safe country.
Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak also echoed Johnson's sentiments and said that the asylum plan sought to deter vulnerable migrants from joining criminal gangs and engaging in evil activities.
In April 2024, UK's treaty with Rwanda was ratified and the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Act 2024 became law.

The All Saints Cathedral has demanded an
apology from the Inspector General of Police Japhet Koome over the conduct of
police officers during the anti-Finance Bill 2024 protests in Nairobi last
week.
In a statement on Sunday, the church said
that protesters took refuge in their premises on Tuesday, June 25 but officers
still lobbed teargas canisters and fired live rounds of ammunition in their
compound, harming some people.
“At 4:30 pm a contingent of military
officers stormed the compound of ASC threatening everyone they found. Ordering
unarmed. peaceful youth to lie down and they shot live bullets indiscriminately
in the compound,” read the statement in part.
The church said as such, the police violated the
church's sanctity. It demanded that police respect all protected public
infrastructures.
""We therefore demand an apology from
the inspector General of Police for his officers nearly deconsecrating our
place of worship,"" said the cathedral.
President William Ruto succumbed to
mounting public pressure on Wednesday, June 26 and announced that he would not
sign the contentious Finance Bill 2024 into law.
He said instead, he would engage Kenyan
youth to hear their perspectives and concerns.
Ruto has already submitted a Memorandum of
Referral to National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetangula, officially initiating
the process to have the controversial Bill withdrawn.
Protests against the proposed law saw over
27 youths killed by police while many more sustained injuries after police
officers fired live bullets at the unarmed crowds.
Human rights groups report that the number
of victims could be higher, as more unidentified bodies lie in morgues across
the nation.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/kenyans-pile-pressure-on-cs-namwamba-to-release-list-of-olympics-travel-team-n345497,"Kenyans pile pressure on CS Namwamba to release list of Olympics travel team
The CS, who over the weekend unveiled the official kit for the Kenyan Olympics team, has found himself in uncharted waters after Kenyans directed their focus on him, pressuring him to publicise his Paris itinerary and all the individuals involved.
The pressure has mostly come from renowned content creator Dennis Ombachi who has vowed to focus all his energies on the CS in a bid to get accountability over the ministry's activities.
Ombachi's activism has now galvanised Kenyans who have been repeatedly pressuring Namwamba to clarify his Paris trip with many fearing that the CS may include tens of unnecessary hangers-on into the trip.
""@AbabuNamwamba we will need a breakdown of how much it will cost the taxpayer for the delegation as the list is announced to the public, from flight tickets, allowance’s, accommodation e.t.c. We already know the athlete’s allowances structures we need the delegations too and cross check,"" Ombachi wrote.
Aware of the growing concerns, Namwamba replied to Ombachi, telling him that he was ready to host the content creator to address the issues raised with the aim of streamlining the ministry.
""My joy is the growth of sports in Kenya as a key economic driver, and the sustainable success of sportsmen and women. I would be glad to host you, and many others, on a day of your choice, for a public forum where we would, foremost, listen to you all, before we share on the work of the ministry, since I took over, and the vision that I have for the Ministry,"" Namwamba wrote.
""It would be great having you, and many others, as accountability partners in this journey. Waiting to hear on When and Where. X or the Ministry?""
Despite his efforts to calm the masses and invite them to the discussions table, Kenyans have still maintained that they will not rest until the list has been made public, while some have also even gone to court to demand for the same.
Popular X personality Beverlyn Kwamboka, and two others, have actually gone the legal way and shared a demand letter addressed to the CS, requiring him to share the list as a matter of public interest.
The letter reads in part: ""We act for Charleen Njuguna, Jolly Lanji, and Bevalyne Kwamboka. Our clients are active citizens who, from the Rio experience, are concerned about the true cost of Kenya's delegation to the Paris Olympics. The Olympics run from Friday, 26 July 2024 to Sunday, 11 August 2024.""
""Under Article 35(2)(b) of the Constitution and section 4 of the Access to Information Act, 2016, our clients formally seek the following information from you: A list of all non-competitive participants travelling at public expense with the official Kenyan delegation to the Paris Olympics.
""A schedule of the individual roles of each of the non-competitive participants travelling at public expense with the official Kenyan delegation to the Paris Olympics and a schedule of the allowances and sustenance costs for each of the non-competitive participants travelling at public expense to the Paris Olympics.""
Despite the unrelenting pressure, the CS has not addressed the matter publicly and explicitly. His last X post was of himself, TV host Dr. Ofweneke and others doing the dance challenge 'Anguka Nayo'.
Already, the athletes' kit has caused much furore online with Kenyans blasting the designers for what they have termed as cheap and ugly outfits.

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/paris-will-show-value-of-hosting-olympics-says-tokyo-games-chief-n345425,"Paris will show value of hosting Olympics, says Tokyo Games chief
Paris will remind people of the value of hosting
the Olympics, says a top official of the Tokyo 2020 Games, which were delayed
by a year because of Covid and tainted by corruption.
Seiko Hashimoto, who was president of the Tokyo
Olympics organising committee, told AFP that the Japanese public were bitterly
split over hosting the Games during the pandemic.
A corruption scandal had also ""soured""
the Olympics' image in Japanese people's minds, she said.
But Hashimoto hopes Paris can showcase sport at
its best this month and make people in the French capital happy that their city
is hosting the event.
""I hope every single person will understand
the value and importance of hosting the Olympics in their own
country,"" said Hashimoto, a seven-time Olympian.
""If this serves as an opportunity for
people to think about what the Olympics and Paralympics mean to them, it will
be something that benefits future generations.""
Hashimoto admitted that many people in Japan
questioned why the country went ahead with the event during the pandemic.
The Tokyo Olympics were held under strict
anti-virus rules, with spectators banned from most venues and street
festivities scrapped in order to minimise the risk of infections.
The lucky fans who were allowed in were
forbidden from cheering and required to wear masks at all times.
Looking back, Hashimoto said organisers could
have allowed venues to be 50 or 60 percent full of spectators.
But she said the decision to bar them was the
only realistic option at the time.
""We argued over and over again that we
could host it safely, but no one listened,"" she said.
""Conversely, had we given in to pressure
and cancelled the Games, I think people would have said, 'Why didn't you work
harder and think of ways to hold the Olympics?'""
Hashimoto finds solace in the fact that some
children were invited into venues through special programmes.
She says without hesitation that hosting the
Games was ""the right decision"".
""I believe the Tokyo Games left their mark
in that we were able to show we could respond to various demands and still move
forward with the project,"" she said.
""For better or worse, we hosted the Tokyo
Games. Maybe there were some shortcomings, but I believe we left a good example
of what can be done despite very difficult conditions.""
- 'Unprecedented
experience' -
The legacy of the Tokyo Olympics was also
tainted by a corruption scandal that emerged once the Games were over. A series
of trials have so far found 10 people guilty of paying bribes in connection
with the event.
Hashimoto was parachuted into the organising
committee's top job less than six months before the Games began, after previous
president Yoshiro Mori was ousted for making sexist remarks.
She maintains that organisers did a good job in
difficult circumstances, saying they were able to host the Games ""with
almost no infections"".
But she admits she has regrets over lost
opportunities due to the pandemic, which robbed Tokyo of its chance to shine
fully on the global stage.
""From the preparation stage, Tokyo had
received very high reviews,"" she said.
""There were such high hopes, much more than
other cities and countries. There were so many things that we wanted to do but
couldn't.
""That's a regret that I have,"" she
added.
Hashimoto said Tokyo's ability to deliver the
Games in difficult circumstances can provide useful lessons for future Olympic
organisers.
She has full confidence Paris chiefs can put on
a ""perfect"" Games.
""I believe the Paris
committee has grown considerably because it was able to see our unprecedented
experience of organising the event in the midst of the pandemic, and took
lessons from it,"" she said.

Published on: June 27, 2024 04:00 (EAT)
Soldiers of the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) are deployed at a stadium ahead of a planned demonstration called after a nationwide deadly protest against a controversial now-withdrawn tax bill left over 20 dead in downtown Nairobi, on June 27, 2024. Kenyans are preparing to take to the streets on Thursday for a white march the day after President William Ruto announced the withdrawal of the draft budget providing for tax increases, at the origin of a protest which foundered in murderous violence. (Photo by LUIS TATO / AFP)
Kenyan police fired rubber bullets and tear gas at demonstrators in Nairobi on Thursday, as protesters returned to the streets despite President William Ruto scrapping contentious tax hikes after deadly clashes.
The protests -- led largely by young Kenyans -- caught the authorities off-guard, as Ruto's government ricocheted between taking a tough line on the unrest and calling for dialogue.
Dozens of protesters gathered in Nairobi's central business district, with soldiers deployed and police in anti-riot gear blocking access along roads leading to Ruto's office at State House and parliament, according to AFP journalists.
Officers fired rubber bullets and tear gas at small groups of protesters and arrested at least seven people, with scuffles erupting as some demonstrators threw stones at police, AFP journalists saw.
""The youth will not rest,"" Lucky, a 27-year-old university graduate, told AFP.
""It's our future we are fighting for,"" he said, adding that he did not trust Ruto, who had earlier likened the demonstrators to ""criminals"" before backing down.
Many shops remained shuttered as traders worried about further unrest.
Protesters also rallied in the port city of Mombasa and the opposition bastion of Kisumu, with some blocking roads and lighting fires in the lakeside city.
After the parliament complex was ransacked on Tuesday and police opened fire on protesters, Ruto made a surprise U-turn on the tax hikes that set off the demonstrations.
He declined to sign the increases into law and withdrew the bill on Wednesday.
""The people have spoken,"" he said, adding that he would seek ""engagement with the young people of our nation"".
But protesters maintained Thursday's rally in memory of those killed in the demonstrations, criticising Ruto's dramatic reversal as a case of too little, too late.
Ivy, a 26-year-old job seeker, told AFP Wednesday that Ruto's about-turn was ""a start to changing things.""
""He could have done this earlier without people having to die,"" she added, echoing the words of other protesters interviewed by AFP.
A state-backed rights group counted 22 dead nationwide -- 19 in Nairobi alone -- in the aftermath of Tuesday's protests and vowed an investigation.
""This is the largest number of deaths (in) a single day protest,"" said Roseline Odede, chairwoman of the state-funded Kenya National Commission on Human Rights, adding that 300 people were injured across the country.
Shops were largely closed in Nairobi's business district on Thursday.
""We cannot take risk. We don't know what happens next,"" said Joe, an employee in a perfume store, as he prepared to head home.
""Why did they have to kill these young people? This bill is not worth people dying,"" the 30-year-old said.
""We are in uncharted waters.""
The unrest has alarmed the international community, with Washington calling on Kenya to respect the right to peaceful protest and the UN urging ""accountability"" for the bloodshed.
Rights watchdogs have accused the authorities of abducting protesters.
The police have not responded to AFP requests for comment.
Ruto rolled back some of the tax measures last week, prompting the treasury to warn of a budget shortfall of 200 billion shillings ($1.6 billion).
Ruto said Wednesday that withdrawing the bill would mean a significant hole in funding for development programmes to help farmers and teachers, among others.
The cash-strapped government had said previously that the increases were necessary to service Kenya's debt of some 10 trillion shillings ($78 billion), equal to roughly 70 percent of GDP.
Analysts warned that Ruto's administration faced a tough choice in the weeks ahead.
The government ""will now have to find a way to pacify two opposing forces: a populace willing to resort to violence to protect livelihoods, and a macroeconomic trajectory that, bar considerable multilateral support, is heading towards a cliff,"" Oxford Economics said in a note.
Ruto's administration is under pressure from the International Monetary Fund, which has called for fiscal reforms in order to access crucial funding.

Odhiambo explained that the legal body maintained its stance in advocating for the release of those abducted.
Ernest Nyerere and Nthia were picked up from their residence at 5:00 am by seven armed men.
""We’ve confirmed several people who were abducted on different days have been released including Ernest Nyerere, Nadia Nthia and Shadrack Kiprono aka Shad,"" she said.
“The abductions and continued illegal detentions are a dent on the rule of law. As a country, we must be guided by the rule of law at all times.”
At 1:22 pm, Nthia took to X to reveal that they were dumped in the middle of nowhere by unknown men.
“Nyerere and I were abducted from our home at around 4:00 am this morning by seven heavily armed men. We were just released and dumped in the middle of nowhere. We are safe. We are unharmed. Thank you fighting for us,” Nthia stated.
LSK revealed that about 50 young Kenyans had been abducted due to the ongoing protests against the Finance Bill 2024.
These include Osama Otero, Gabriel Oguda, John Frank Githiaka-Franje, Drey Mwangi, Worldsmith, Hilla254 among others.
The legal body called for the unconditional release of those captured and advocated for justice for all peaceful protestors.
LSK also questioned why the international community remained tight-lipped on the matter despite police officers using brute force against the protestors.
“Are you proud of what is happening in Kenya? Is this your gameplan for Kenya as a non-NATO ally?” LSK posed.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/ruto-dismisses-photo-of-child-shot-8-times-in-rongai-says-incident-happened-years-ago-n345285,"Ruto dismisses photo of child shot 8 times in Rongai, says incident happened years ago
President William Ruto on Friday disputed reports of a young
child sustaining eight gunshot wounds in Ongata Rongai during the
anti-government protests.
Speaking during the Space Conversation hosted by influencer Osama Otero,
President Ruto explained that the photos used dated back years ago to an
incident in Buru Buru and did not reflect the situation at Rongai.
He said that opportunists seized the peaceful protests to push their
agendas.
“It was said that a young Kenyan was stuffed with 8 bullets, that is not
true. The one that was said of 8 bullets did not exist. We found out that it
happened several years ago in Buru Buru,” Ruto said.
This did not sit well with Kenyans online who told the president to take
accountability for the brute force used by the anti-riot officers on peaceful
protestors.
“The right to picket is enshrined in the Constitution. The protests were
hijacked and I am sure the people who burnt parliament were not peaceful
protestors,” he responded.
“Honestly do you want to tell me the innocent protestors are the ones who
disrupted businesses, burn down parliament? We need to protect protestors but
also keep away criminals.”
Kennedy Onyango, a 12-year-old was reportedly shot eight times during the
first week of protests. His mother, who spoke to Citizen Digital, said that her
son was killed yet he was not part of the protests.
""Mtoto wangu hakuwa na hatia, mtoto wangu hakuwa kwa maandamano ,
mtoto wangu hajaiba, risasi ni ya kuua mwizi, si mtoto wa 12 years,""
Kennedy's mum said.
""Mtoto wangu ndoto yake alikuwa ananiambia hii kuchora kwangu
itanipeleka America, alikuwa anataka achore hadi achukuliwe already walimu wako
na hiyo detail yake vitu zake zilipelekwa mahali sijui ni wapi.”
She explained that her son was picking a book he was sharing with a
neighbouring classmate before he encountered his fate.
“Alitoka shule lakini alikuwa na homework, akatoka kuendea kitabu kwa
rafiki yake lakini hakurudi,” he said.
Ruto also dismissed reports of Githurai massacre, whereby over 200 lives
were allegedly lost, saying that the families should step forward to ascertain
the claim.
“ It is good to be brutally honest and I will not ever say anything that is not factual, especially on a very serious matter. Are you saying 200 people were killed in Githurai? Really my friend, can the families step forward? 200 people is no joke. I am sorry to tell you that you have wrong numbers. Forget about social media,. Tomorrow I want to offer you to bring names to State House,” Ruto informed Otero.

Published on: July 03, 2024 10:35 (EAT)
Spain's Carlos Alcaraz celebrates winning a point against Australia's Aleksander Vukic during their men's singles second round tennis match on the third day of the 2024 Wimbledon Championships at The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in Wimbledon, southwest London, on July 3, 2024. (Photo by ANDREJ ISAKOVIC / AFP)
Carlos Alcaraz raced into the Wimbledon third round on Wednesday as Japanese superstar Naomi Osaka was demolished on her return to Centre Court after a five-year absence.
Alcaraz defeated Australia's world number 69 Aleksandar Vukic 7-6 (7/5), 6-2, 6-2 on the back of 42 winners.
The third-seeded Spaniard's only moments of concern came in the first set when he let slip a 5-2 lead and found himself 5-6 down with Vukic serving for the opener.
However, the three-time major winner steadied the ship to race away to victory against a player who got the better of him in qualifying at the 2020 French Open.
Alcaraz next faces fellow crowd-pleaser Frances Tiafoe, the American player he defeated in five sets in the semi-finals of the 2022 US Open on his way to his first Grand Slam triumph.
""I'm going for him,"" said Alcaraz, who is bidding to become just the sixth man after Rod Laver, Bjorn Borg, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic to win the French Open and Wimbledon titles back to back.
""I'm ready to play a really high level of tennis and hopefully take him.""
Tiafoe made the third round by seeing off Borna Coric in straight sets.
Four-time major winner Osaka, playing on Centre Court for the first time since 2019, went down 6-4, 6-1 to America's Emma Navarro in just 59 minutes.
The 26-year-old former world number one is now ranked at 113 having only returned to the tour in January after giving birth to daughter Shai last year.
""I'm a little disappointed because I wanted to do really well. I feel like I put a lot of time into it. There's always next year,"" said Osaka.
Eccentric Fabio Fognini of Italy needed a clutch of match points to knock out eighth-seeded Casper Ruud 6-4, 7-5, 6-7 (1/7), 6-3.
The 37-year-old Fognini, sporting bleach-blond hair, twice served for the match from 5-2 up in the third set before sealing victory over the three-time Grand Slam runner-up in the fourth set.
""It just shows why I love and hate this sport,"" said Fognini.
Daniil Medvedev, the 2021 US Open champion, came back from dropping the first set and facing two set points in the second to see off Alexandre Muller of France 6-7 (3/7), 7-6 (7/4), 6-4, 7-5.
Tomas Machac, who had been scheduled to face Andy Murray before the two-time champion withdrew, came back from 0-5 down in the final set to beat lucky loser David Goffin in a tie-break.
World number two and US Open champion Coco Gauff cruised into the third round with a 6-2, 6-1 win over Romanian qualifier Anca Todoni.
""I'm happy with the way I played, could have been cleaner on some points,"" said Gauff, who broke her 19-year-old opponent five times.
The American, who made her career breakthrough at Wimbledon as a 15-year-old qualifier in 2019, goes on to face British qualifier Sonay Kartal, the world number 298.
World number one Jannik Sinner, who reached the semi-finals last year, is in evening action against Italian compatriot and former runner-up Matteo Berrettini.
Italian men's tennis has rarely been stronger, with the country boasting five players in the top 50 while the nation swept to Davis Cup glory last season.
Ten Italian men started the singles tournament this year at Wimbledon.
Sinner was the first Italian man to capture a Grand Slam title with his victory at the Australian Open in January and was also the first from his country to become world number one.
""I feel like in Italy we have so many tournaments, starting with juniors, then the Futures and Challengers,"" said 22-year-old Sinner.
""We have big, big ATP tournaments there. We have good facilities and great coaches.""
Berrettini can boast his own breakthrough Italian moment when he was the first to make a Wimbledon men's final in 2021.
It could be a memorable day for Chinese tennis with teenager Shang Juncheng taking on 10th-seeded Grigor Dimitrov and 32nd seed Zhang Zhizhen facing Germany's Jan-Lennard Struff.
Until Monday, no Chinese man had won a match at Wimbledon in the Open era.

Despite their relegation from the Kenya Women’s Premier League after wobbly campaign, Madira Soccer Assassins head coach Francis Muhambe is positive of the season they had in the top division.
Assassins fell to the relegation axe after a tame 1-1 draw
against Kibera Soccer Ladies in their final game of the season.
""The Madira Girls have been a good example for young
girls with dreams of playing soccer,"" Muhambe said, but was quick to point
out the challenges the team encountered in the campaign, criticising the
federation for not providing adequate rest periods for his players, who had
represented the country in various matches.
According to Muhambe,
the lack of rest led to the team's poor performance throughout the season.
""Every player should be given an opportunity, looking
at what these young girls have done to the country is amazing. It is them that
have taken us to the World Cup. Let there be an equal opportunity for all
regardless of age,"" he urged.
This season, Madira Soccer Assassins had the youngest squad
in the national women's league, with most players being students. Despite their
youthful roster, the team struggled to secure enough points, finishing the
season with 14 points after 19 matches, which ultimately led to their
relegation.
And as the team looks to regroup and rebuild in the
second-tier league, the focus, according to the coach, is on acquiring adequate
equipment and developing the next generation of soccer stars and ensuring that
young girls have the support and opportunities they need to succeed in the
sport.

""Mtoto wangu hakuwa na hatia, mtoto wangu hakuwa kwa maandamano , mtoto wangu hajaiba, risasi ni ya kuua mwizi, si mtoto wa 12 years,"" Kennedy's mum said.
According to his mother, Kennedy, 12, was one of the top three students at his school to be shortlisted in a painting competition.
""Mtoto wangu alikuwa anachora, alikuwa anataka kuenda America, hakuwa anataka kuwa kuwa kwa serikali, ndoto yake ilikuwa kuchora,"" Kennedy's mum added.

She said her son had spent 3 days working on the piece he submitted.
He was thrilled to see his American dream come true.
According to his family, Kennedy left the house that fateful day to pick up a book he was sharing with a neighbouring classmate.
“Alitoka shule lakini alikuwa na homework, akatoka kuendea kitabu kwa rafiki yake lakini hakurudi,” His mum said.
He would reportedly be shot eight times as the protests took an ugly turn, in a night riddled with violence, gunfire and looting.
""Mama ya huyo kijana alisema kijana wake alingoja ken kama walivyo kubaliana lakini Ken hakufika,"" Jocinter Anyango said.
""Alikuja kuskia Kennedy ameuawa.""
His classmate would wait for hours to hand over the book, only to learn later that he had been shot and killed.
Kennedy's family was also outraged by President Ruto's comments in a Sunday interview, in which he was asked to send a message to the mother of a 12-year-old boy who was shot eight times.
His mother said she watched President Ruto in dismay as he appeared unsure of the 12-year-old's fate after being shot eight times.
He is still alive right?"" posed Ruto.
He was then fact-checked by the panelists who revealed that the boy had actually died.
""On the 12-year-old shot with eight bullets, I am telling the mother of this young person that as president, I will make sure that I give her an explanation of what really happened."" President Ruto said.
"" I will make sure that we bring this to a situation where, like myself who has children, her child can be accounted for. ""
President Ruto said the Rongai protests were infiltrated by goons who even took a gun from a police officer and shot into crowds.
He said investigations into the incident will reveal whether the 12-year-old boy was shot by police or by the goons.
The late 12-year-old Kennedy Onyango Ouma, who tragically lost his life in Rongai last Thursday during protests, succumbed to a fatal bullet wound. Dr. Peter Ndegwa, the government pathologist who conducted the postmortem at Ongata Rongai Sub-County Hospital Funeral Home, confirmed that the bullet had shattered his arteries and punctured his lungs.

President Ruto was addressing the nation following a day of protests that killed at least five people and injured over 125 others.
According to the Head of State, criminals hijacked a critical conversation, causing havoc throughout the country and desecrating the August House.
""I hereby put on notice the planners, financiers, orchestrators, and abettors of violence and anarchy that the security infrastructure established to protect our republic and its sovereignty will be to deployed secure the country and restore order and normalcy,"" President Ruto said.
According to President Ruto, it is inconceivable that criminals posing as peaceful protesters can terrorise people, elected representatives, and institutions and expect to get away with it.
""We must isolate crime from democratic expression and separate criminals from people exercising their freedom of expression and divergent opinion,"" he added.
A tough-talking Ruto promised a full and prompt response to Tuesday's events to ensure that such an event did not occur again.
"" I assure Kenyans that we shall provide a full, effective, and expeditious response to today's treasonous events,"" President Ruto said.

Kishane Thompson won the men's 100m in 9.77secs, the fastest time in the world this year, and Shericka Jackson dominated the women's 100m final on Friday at the Jamaican Olympic athletics trials.
Thompson, with a wind of 0.9m/sec, took the title in Kingston with Oblique Seville second in 9.82 and Ackeem Blake third in 9.92 to book their trips to the Paris Olympics.
Thompson, 22, improved upon the year's prior best, a 9.79 by Kenya's Ferdinand Omanyala two weeks ago in Nairobi.
After not racing all season, Thompson cruised in the Jamaican trials, running 9.82 in Thursday heats and 9.84 in the semi-finals earlier on Friday.
Thompson withdrew before last year's semi-finals in the qualifying meet for the World Championships despite a 9.86 qualifying run, but he later ran 9.85 at a Diamond League meet in Xiamen then went 9.87 at Eugene.
Jackson, a two-time 200m world champion and two-time 100m world runner-up who was third in the 100 at the Tokyo Olympics, won the women's 100 in 10.84secs (-0.3 m/sec wind).
An injury had knocked out reigning Olympic champion Elaine Thompson-Herah, the 100 and 200 gold medal winner at the Rio and Tokyo Games.
The final runner-up was 19-year-old Tia Clayton in 10.90 with 37-year-old Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce third in 10.94 to book her trip to Paris.
Fraser-Pryce, the 2008 and 2012 100m Olympic champion ran 10.91 in the semi-finals before grabbing her spot smoothly in the run for France.

A police car was burned and 20 officers
injured on Tuesday evening in an exchange with protesters in Kiambu County’s
Githurai area.
This followed day-long demonstrations
against the Finance Bill 2024 as residents took to the streets in
solidarity with other protesters countrywide.
Residents say the marches, which took
place mostly along the Thika Superhighway, turned chaotic after officers lobbed
tear gas at peaceful protesters, making them charge back at the police.
Police however say the group of an
estimated 6,000 protesters lit a fire on the road and turned down the police commander’s request that they disperse.
A police report filed at Mwiki Police
Station says the crowd began pelting the officers with stones.
“Tear gas was fired to disperse them but
they overpowered the officers and the officers withdrew,” police say.
The crowd is then said to have blocked the road with an electricity pole, cut off a police Land Cruiser from the convoy and burned it down. Two other police pick-up trucks were vandalised.
“As the officers were retreating, the
rioters followed them to Githurai Mwiki police station. They wanted to overrun
the station but they were overpowered and they retreated,” reads the report.
Police said all the injured officers were treated
in various health centres and discharged.
Residents allege that tear gas filled the air and
people’s houses in the Githurai 45 area late in the evening, forcing them to
get out. They say they also heard gunshot sounds late into the night.

Faith Odhiambo, president of the Law Society of Kenya (LSK), made the revelation on Sunday, but did not explain why Mr Keter was arrested.
Keter was in the company of his wife and children when their car, a Land Cruiser V8, which was blocked by a Ford Ranger double-cabin along Nyeri Road in the shocking incident.
The former MP was then forcefully pulled out of his car as members of the public watched on, with some screaming as Keter resisted the abduction.
He was bundled into the pickup which then drove off, leaving his wife and kids utterly shocked.
His abduction comes a day after he attended the burial of Comedian Fred Omondi in Siaya, where he applauded Kenyan youth for taking to the streets to protest the unpopular Finance Bill 2024.
Keter urged the youth to continue agitating for their rights, joining a host of other people who have rejected the punitive bill.
The former MP has been a huge critic of the current government and its policies, siding with the opposition and indeed protesters who are now calling for President Ruto to resign from office.
Keter's abduction is the latest in a chain of others that have targeted proponents of the huge protests that took place in most parts of the country.
Social media influencers who have called and fuelled the protests have been targeted lately, despite President Ruto calling for the release of all those who were abducted.
The nationwide protests saw Ruto reject the entire bill, but labelled protesters who stormed Parliament as criminals. Ruto has vowed to deal with them.

Published on: July 01, 2024 12:17 (EAT)
Spain's midfielder Nico Williams celebrates scoring his team's third goal during the UEFA Euro 2024 round of 16 football match between Spain and Georgia at the Cologne Stadium in Cologne on June 30, 2024. (Photo by Angelos TZORTZINIS / AFP)
Rodri, Fabian Ruiz, Nico Williams and Dani Olmo all scored as Spain came from behind to beat surprise packages Georgia 4-1 at Euro 2024 on Sunday and set up a blockbuster quarter-final against hosts Germany.
Robin Le Normand's own goal gave Georgia a shock lead in the 18th minute of this last-16 tie to send their noisy supporters wild in Cologne.
It was the first goal Spain had conceded at the competition but they came back to equalise six minutes before the interval courtesy of Manchester City midfielder Rodri.
Ruiz then headed home in the 51st minute and Williams ran through for the third before substitute Olmo made sure of the win as La Roja stay on track to become European champions for the fourth time.
Spain now take on Germany in the last eight in Stuttgart on Friday in a repeat of the Euro 2008 final, which they won 1-0 to begin their golden era of dominance in international football.
Luis de la Fuente's current team are looking to bring back the glory days and they were expected to brush Georgia aside here.
They would have ultimately won by a far greater margin had they converted more of their chances, with 16-year-old winger Lamine Yamal squandering several opportunities in his attempt to become the youngest ever goal-scorer at the Euros.
Georgia are ranked 74th in the world, 66 places below Spain. Willy Sagnol's team lost twice to Spain in qualifying, going down 7-1 at home and 3-1 away.
Yet they still qualified for a first major tournament and then made it to the knockout stages with a stunning 2-0 win over Portugal.
Sagnol said on the eve of this match that his unfancied team had ""already won the European Championship"" thanks to their remarkable run, and they now go home with their heads held high despite eventually crumbling here.
They have a lively attacking partnership between Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and Georges Mikautadze that is a danger for any opponent, and Giorgi Mamardashvili has been one of the best goalkeepers at the tournament.
Mamardashvili had already saved from Pedri and kept out Dani Carvajal's glancing header before Georgia went ahead.
The move started with a fine piece of play by Kvaratskhelia, who had little room to manoeuvre on the left wing but picked out a pass for Mikautadze, who then released Otar Kakabadze on the right wing.
Kakabadze's cross into the box was a horrible one for Le Normand, who had Kvaratskhelia arriving behind him and could not stop the ball rebounding off him and into the net for the eighth own goal of Euro 2024.
Spain were now vulnerable to the counterattack, which is Georgia's strength, but the men in red continued to dominate the game and kept testing Mamardashvili.
The Valencia shot-stopper made several more interventions in an increasingly wild encounter before the equaliser finally came, Rodri controlling a Williams pass at the edge of the box and stroking the ball into the corner.
It felt as if that might be that for Georgia, but they remained audacious on the break, with Kvaratskhelia almost scoring from inside his own half at the beginning of the second period, his shot going just wide with goalkeeper Unai Simon out of position.
Spain went ahead shortly after, as Yamal crossed from the right for Ruiz to head in his second goal of the tournament at the back post.
Yamal didn't just miss chances of his own, as he also forced an own goal which was disallowed for offside before Georgia fell apart defensively under increasingly heavy rain.
Ruiz released Williams, who ran from inside his own half, skipped past Giorgi Gvelesiani into the box and fired into the roof of the net to make it 3-1 on 75 minutes.
A delightful control and finish from the edge of the box by Olmo completed the scoring with seven minutes left.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/russia-starts-secret-trial-for-us-reporter-gershkovich-on-spy-charges-n344745,"Russia starts secret trial for U.S. reporter Gershkovich on spy charges
U.S. journalist Evan Gershkovich went on trial behind closed doors on Wednesday in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg, where he faces charges of espionage and a likely sentence of up to 20 years in prison.
Prosecutors say the Wall Street Journal reporter gathered secret information on the orders of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency about a company that manufactures tanks for Russia's war in Ukraine.
Gershkovich, his newspaper and the U.S. government all reject the allegations and say that he was just doing his job as a reporter accredited by the Foreign Ministry to work in Russia.
""This bogus accusation of espionage will inevitably lead to a bogus conviction for an innocent man,"" Wall Street Journal editor-in-chief Emma Tucker said in a letter to readers.
The U.S. embassy said in a statement: ""His case is not about evidence, procedural norms, or the rule of law. It is about the Kremlin using American citizens to achieve its political objectives.""
The Kremlin declined to comment on the opening of the trial. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters: ""We know that this topic is very, very resonant in the United States, but it is not so resonant within our country.""
After several hours of closed proceedings, the court said the next session would take place on Aug. 13 - an indication the case will drag on for months.
Journalists were briefly allowed to film the 32-year-old before the start of the trial, from which the media are barred.
The reporter was shaven-headed, in contrast to previous court appearances, and wore an open-necked shirt. He smiled and nodded at colleagues he recognised.
Prosecutor Mikael Ozdoyev spoke briefly to journalists to summarise the charges. ""Gershkovich carried out the illegal actions while observing painstaking conspiratorial measures,"" he said.
US REPORTER'S TRIAL HELD IN SECRET
Closed trials are standard in Russia for alleged treason or espionage involving classified material. The lawyers sign non-disclosure agreements, preventing the emergence of any details on Gershkovich's alleged actions and how he will defend himself.
The Kremlin says the case and the trial arrangements are a matter for the court, but has stated - without publishing evidence - that Gershkovich was caught ""red-handed"".
Against the background of the Ukraine war, he and other Americans detained in Russia have been caught up in the gravest crisis between Moscow and Washington for more than 60 years.
President Vladimir Putin has said Russia is open to a prisoner exchange involving Gershkovich and that contacts with the United States have taken place but must remain secret.
The U.S. has accused Russia of using Gershkovich and another jailed American, Paul Whelan, as bargaining chips. It has designated both men as ""wrongfully detained"" and says it is committed to bringing them home.
The U.S. Embassy said Russian authorities had failed to provide evidence supporting the charges against Gershkovich or to explain why his work as a journalist constituted a crime.
GERSHKOVICH ALLEGED TO HAVE RESEARCHED TANK MAKER
The trial is taking place in Yekaterinburg, 900 miles (1,400 km) east of Moscow, where officers of the FSB security service arrested Gershkovich on March 29, 2023, while he was eating in a steakhouse. He has spent nearly 16 months in Moscow's Lefortovo prison.
The Wall Street Journal has declined to comment on the purpose of his reporting trip to the Urals region or on the specific allegation that he was seeking information on Uralvagonzavod, a supplier of tanks for Russia's war in Ukraine.
""He was there as an accredited journalist, doing his job,"" Wall Street Journal publisher Almar Latour told Reuters in a phone interview before the trial.
Many Western news organisations pulled staff out of Russia after Putin sent his army into Ukraine in February 2022 and Moscow passed laws that set long prison terms for ""discrediting"" the armed forces or spreading ""fake news"" about them.
Gershkovich was one of a small number of Western reporters, also including journalists from Reuters, who continued to report from inside Russia.
Russia said in the first weeks after his arrest that any exchange could only take place after a trial. Kremlin spokesman Peskov reiterated on Wednesday that contacts with the U.S. on a possible deal required ""silence"" and Moscow would not speak publicly about them.

England manager Gareth Southgate said he was ""immensely proud"" to lead the Three Lions into a first ever major tournament final on foreign soil after a dramatic 2-1 win over the Netherlands on Wednesday.
Ollie Watkins struck a stoppage-time winner in Dortmund to send England into Sunday's final against Spain in Berlin.
For the third consecutive game England were forced to come from behind after Xavi Simons' early thunderbolt for the Dutch.
But Southgate's men got their rewards for a much-improved performance as Harry Kane levelled from the penalty spot before Aston Villa striker Watkins proved the unlikely hero after his limited role at the tournament so far.
""I was really pleased with the quality of our play. It will be, I would imagine, a long time, if ever, an English side had 60 percent of the ball against a side from the Netherlands. So it shows the more modern England way,"" said Southgate.
The England boss had been heavily criticised after his side needed late equalisers against Slovakia and Switzerland to reach the last four.
But in four major tournaments in charge, Southgate has now led his country to two finals, a semi-final and a quarter-final.
And he is keen to make amends from losing the Euro 2020 final on penalties to Italy at Wembley three years ago.
""The only reason I did the job when I took it on was to try and bring success to England as a nation and to try and improve English football,"" he added.
""To be able to take the team to a first final overseas, I'm immensely proud of that.
""But now of course we've come here to win. We play the team who've been the best team in the tournament and we have a day less to prepare, so it's a huge task. But we're still here and we're fighting.""
Victory was especially sweet for Southgate after the backlash he received for England's shaky start to the tournament.
He had been targeted by thrown beer cups after a 0-0 draw against Slovenia in the group stage.
""We all want to be loved, right?"" Soughtate said on his warmer reception from the travelling fans in Dortmund.
""When you're doing something for your country and you're a proud Englishman and when you don't feel that back and when all you read is criticism, it's hard.
""So, to be able to celebrate a second final is very, very special.""

Kenya's Faith Kipyegon gave herself a timely Olympic tonic by bettering her own world record in the women's 1500m at the Paris Diamond League meet on Sunday.
Led out by two pacemakers, Kipyegon broke to the front and clocked 3min 49.04sec in a superb display of running at Stade Charlety.
She improved by 0.07sec her previous best set in Florence in June 2023.
Kipyegon, 30, will return to Paris for the Summer Games as one of the hot favourites.
She is already a double Olympic 1500m champion, and also has three world titles.
Last year at the Budapest worlds, she did the double by winning the 5,000m alongside the 1500m.
""It feels amazing to break the world record. I am in the right direction towards the Paris Olympics,"" Kipyegon said.
""I have come from far because of the injury and recovering. After the trials I knew that I was in world record shape. I have run the quickest time in Kenya with the altitude.
""It showed me that I was capable of breaking the world record again. We just tried, because everything is possible.""
Australian Jessica Hull ran an Oceania record of 3:50.83 for second, while Britain's Laura Muir rounded out the podium in a national record of 3:53.79 as the top eight athletes all set personal bests.
""Jessica was really good. I felt that she was behind me and I had to be careful because you never know if something can happen. But I just relaxed and ran my race,"" said Kipyegon.
""I knew that she is strong because she has broken the area record many times. The crowd was really cheerful, that was why the energy was so strong, it is really pushing us towards the finish line.
""With my injury I was really scared because I didn't know if I was going to make it. But I took my time and trusted my team and stayed out of competition for long.
""I will absolutely do the double in Paris, in the 1500m and 5000m!""
Muir said she had ""sensed"" that Kipyegon was going to go for the record.
""The Olympics are going to come in no time, so I am very happy and excited. I did know that I was in this kind of shape. I knew I was in a good spot, but I needed to run my own race. I've never run under 3:54 before so it was amazing,"" Muir said.
""We're not surprised,"" she said of Kipyegon's effort.
""This is my fourth race with Faith where she broke the world record and it is amazing to be a part of that. She is able to do something that we have never seen and that drags all of us to run fast times as well.""
Given the competition in the event, Muir added: ""To win an Olympic medal will require a very fast time. It is going to be so, so hard.""

While sharing the plans on X, Mwangi said he had tried to reach Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja in futile. He also said that his phone calls to both the governor and Shaffie Weru, who runs the events docket in the county, went unanswered.
""We wanted to have a concert on Saturday lakini @SakajaJohnson na watu wake @ShaffieWeru hawachukui simu. Watupatie Uhuru Park tufanye concert on Saturday to honour those the government murdered. Sakaja can we get access to Uhuru Park on Saturday as is? Who do we speak to?"" he tweeted.
Later, however, Boniface revealed that Shaffie Weru had reached out to him and asked him to make his request in writing, with Mwangi adding that this would be a concert akin to the one he helped organise for the Garissa massacre victims in 2015.
""Nairobi County Head of Events @ShaffieWeru has called and told me to request the grounds in writing. We did a concert for the Garissa terror victims in April 2015. It will be great if we get Uhuru Park on Saturday. All artists performed for free. Tag your favourite, let’s do this!"" he added.
In the Saturday concert, the activist is hoping to rope in all the big names in the Kenyan entertainment scene, especially the ones with a track record of artistic activism and releasing socially-conscious music, like Juliani and Eric Wainaina.
Already, the 'Daima' hit-maker has agreed to perform at the event for free - and will bring along his full band.
""@EricWainaina has agreed to perform with his full band. Wacha tupate venue,"" Mwangi posted.
From a private message sent to Mwangi from a Kenyan, the concert should be treated as a solemn sendoff to the gunshot victims as well as yet another opportunity to peacefully assemble and march.
""Let's make it a concert in honour of the fallen. Alafu after the concert, people hold a peaceful march. Slow and solemn. This will not be easy to disrupt,"" the text reads.
Tribute concerts in honour of people killed in peaceful protests are not uncommon around the world. Many countries regularly hold these shows, which are usually free, as a way of remembering the lost souls and celebrating their last efforts on Earth.
After the Iran riots shook the world, several countries with a huge Iranian population, held concerts to honour not just the thousands of other victims but also 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who died after she had been detained by the country's morality police over her clothing.
Global superstar Dua Lipa was one of the leading stars who helped play at concerts in honour of killed Iranians.
Justin Bieber, Yungblud, Ricky Martin, Halsey and Googoosh are also some of the big names who spoke out about Iran and played concerts in honour of the killed protesters.

Mengich also attributed the move to the current economic hardships and the
reduced 2024/2025 budget.
“In
view of the emerging fiscal constraints and the proposed budget cuts and
existing contractual commitments and in further consultation with stakeholders
including the National Treasury, SRC has reviewed the setting and advise of pay
for the second phase of the implementation for 2024/2025,” she said.
“In
consultation with the National Treasury, SRC hereby freezes the upward review
of salaries for all State officers and will review the advice for all other
officers, taking into account the current realities of the economy, any
contractual commitment and reduced budget so as to ensure affordability and
fiscal sustainability of the public wage bill.”
The
SRC boss went on to defend the commission’s earlier decision regarding MPs
getting a pay rise, saying that it was in line with the law.
According
to Ms. Mengich, the commission is mandated to review the salaries of all public
servants after two years, and the notice to increase the pay for legislators was
gazetted in August last year.
She
added that the commission skipped two years without reviewing salaries
following the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020.
“SRC
clarifies that the salary increment for State officers has not been newly
gazetted as referenced in the media. SRC set and published a gazette notice on
August 9, 2023, as part of the 3rd remuneration and benefits review circle for
State officers and other public officers that would be implemented over a
two-year period over 2023/2024 financial year and 2024/2025 financial year,” noted
Ms. Mengich.
“This
review came after a two-year freeze on pay structures for the period 2021/2022
and 2022/2023 on account of the impact of COVID-19 on the economy. The
remaining two years would be implemented in two phases.”
She
expressed the commission’s commitment to managing the public wage bill, saying
that SRC was working to ensure the country lived by its means by decreasing the
current wage bill which stands at 46.64 per cent to 35 per cent by 2028.
“SRC
has been conscious of the need to ensure prudent fiscal sustainability of the
public wage bill and has consistently taken measures towards ensuring the
public service operates within the prescribed affordability,” she noted.
“Consequently,
the wage bill has come down from 54.77% of revenue in 2020/2021 to 46.64% in
2022/2023 and is expected to further decline to 35 % of revenue by 2028. SRC
welcomes the support from all quarters to join efforts towards the goal of
achieving the 35% wage bill to revenue ratio.”
The
remarks by SRC follow public uproar after reports that the commission was
seeking to increase State officers' salaries amidst countrywide protests and
economic hardships.
A
section of MPs and Senators came
out to condemn the commission with some pushing for the disbandment of SRC,
over its insensitivity to issues affecting the country.
President William Ruto also came out to call
for the immediate halting of the salary increment proposals citing the need for
austerity measures.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/wikileaks-assange-set-to-be-freed-after-us-espionage-charge-plea-deal-n344677,"WikiLeaks' Assange set to be freed after US espionage charge plea deal
Assange, 52, has agreed to plead guilty to a single criminal count of conspiring to obtain and disclose classified U.S. national defence documents, according to filings in the U.S. District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands.
The deal marks the end of a legal saga that has seen Assange spend more than five years in a British high-security jail and seven holed up in the Ecuadorean embassy in London as he fought accusations of sex crimes in Sweden and battled extradition to the U.S., where he faced 18 criminal charges.
The U.S. government viewed him as a reckless villain who had endangered the lives of agents throughWikiLeaks mass release of secret U.S. documents - the largest security breaches of their kind in U.S. military history.
But to free press advocates and his supporters, which includes world leaders, celebrities and some prominent journalists, he is a hero for exposing wrongdoing and alleged war crimes, and was persecuted for embarrassing U.S. authorities.
On Wednesday, Assange is due to be sentenced to 62 months of time already served at a hearing in Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands, at 9 a.m. local time (2300 GMT Tuesday).
The U.S. territory in the Pacific was chosen due to Assange's opposition to travelling to the mainland U.S. and for its proximity to Australia, prosecutors said.
Australian-born Assange left Belmarsh maximum security jail in the early hours of Monday, before being bailed by the London High Court and later boarding a flight, his wife, Stella Assange said. He was currently on a stopover in Bangkok, she said.
""I feel elated,"" Stella, who flew to Australia from London on Sunday with the couple's two children, told Reuters.
""I also feel worried ... Until it's fully signed off, I worry, but it looks like we've got there.""
A video posted on X by Wikileaks showed Assange dressed in a blue shirt and jeans signing a document before boarding a private jet. After the hearing in Saipan, Assange will fly to Canberra where he will arrive on Wednesday, his wife said.
He had recently won permission to appeal against the approval of his U.S. extradition and the case was due to be heard at London's High Court next month, a factor that Stella Assange said helped galvanise talks over a deal.
'TOO LONG'
The Australian government, led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, has been pressing U.S. President Joe Biden for Assange's release but declined to comment on the legal proceedings as they were ongoing.
""There is nothing to be gained by his continued incarceration and we want him brought home to Australia,"" Albanese said in the country's parliament.
WikiLeaks came to prominence in 2010 after it released hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. military documents on Washington's wars in Afghanistan and Iraq along with swaths of diplomatic cables.
The trove of more than 700,000 documents included battlefield accounts such as a 2007 video of a U.S. Apache helicopter firing at suspected insurgents in Iraq, killing a dozen people including two Reuters news staff. That video was released in 2010.
""Julian Assange endangered the lives of our troops in a time of war and should have been prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" said Mike Pence, who served as U.S. Vice President under Donald Trump when the charges were brought against Assange.
""The Biden administration’s plea deal with Assange is a miscarriage of justice and dishonors the service and sacrifice of the men and women of our Armed Forces and their families,"" he said on X.
The charges against Assange sparked outrage among his many global supporters who have long argued that as the publisher of Wikileaks he should not face charges typically used against federal government employees who steal or leak information.
Many press freedom advocates have argued that criminally charging Assange is a threat to free speech and journalism.
Alan Rusbridger, a former editor of Britain's Guardian newspaper, one of the global titles which worked with WikiLeaks to publish some of the leaked material, said it was ""pretty disturbing"" that espionage laws were being used to target those who revealed uncomfortable information for states.
Stella Assange said the U.S. government should have dropped the case against her husband altogether.
""We will be seeking a pardon, obviously, but the fact that there is a guilty plea, under the Espionage Act, in relation to obtaining and disclosing national defence information is obviously a very serious concern for journalists,"" she said.
SWEDISH ALLEGATIONS
Assange was first arrested in Britain in 2010 on a European arrest warrant after Swedish authorities said they wanted to question him over sex-crime allegations that were later dropped.
He fled to Ecuador's embassy, where he remained for seven years, to avoid extradition to Sweden.
He and Stella, a lawyer who worked on his case, had two children during his time there.
He was dragged out of the embassy in 2019 after Ecuador withdrew his asylum status.
He was jailed for skipping bail and has been in Belmarsh ever since, latterly fighting extradition to the United States.
""Millions of people who have been advocating for Julian, it is almost time for them to have a drink and a celebration,"" his brother Gabriel Shipton told Reuters from France.

Published on: June 28, 2024 09:30 (EAT)

Euro 2024 hosts Germany come into Saturday's last 16 clash with Denmark in Dortmund hoping to have learned from Sunday's 1-1 draw with Switzerland, their final group stage match.
After almost a decade of struggles at major tournaments, Germany were riding high after dominant wins over Scotland and Hungary to start the Euros.
Germany however came crashing back down to earth against Switzerland and were on course for defeat, before Niclas Fuellkrug's stoppage time header snatched a draw - and with it, first place in the group.
It was a wake-up call the hosts needed, particularly with fans already eyeing a fourth Euros crown, and a reminder that coach Julian Nagelsmann has plenty to work on.
Germany boast a shinier trophy cabinet than their northern neighbours but were famously beaten by the Danes in the Euro 1992 final.
Denmark's triumph after failing to qualify and then being admitted following the pre-tournament exclusion of Yugoslavia became a fairytale, but Germany still laments taking the Danes lightly.
A Euros and World Cup winner as a player, Berti Vogts coached Germany in that 1992 final and admitted in his column in the RP newspaper on Thursday that his team ""underestimated"" Denmark.
""In 1992 we lost the Euros final against a great Danish team even though we were the favourites -- like the German team is now,"" he wrote.
""Everyone thought we had the title in the bag - unfortunately some players did too.""
Well-drilled and with a smattering of excellent players at top clubs, 2020 semi-finalists Denmark resemble Switzerland in many ways.
Vogts said the current Danish incarnation may not boast the same level of quality as their 1992 counterparts, but that the pressure is well and truly on the Germans.
""The Danes were hungry for success and carefree, they just played football and took us by surprise -- also because we underestimated them.
""The German team should not make that mistake now. The Switzerland game was therefore an important warning shot.""
Germany won just three of 11 games in 2023 but are yet to lose in 2024, winning five times and drawing twice, thanks at least in part to Nagelsmann picking the same starting XI.
The coach only deviated from his starters when forced through injury or unavailability.
The policy may have given Germany stability, but it cost him centre-back Jonathan Tah for the Denmark clash, after the defender picked up a second yellow card against Switzerland.
In his place, Borussia Dortmund's talented yet unpredictable central defender Nico Schlotterbeck will line-up on Saturday.
Antonio Rudiger is also in doubt for the clash with a hamstring injury, although Schlotterbeck said Thursday: ""I hope it works out that he returns.""
""I had the same injury already and it's not easy to get out of your mind.""
Schlotterbeck said the Germans knew ""actually everything"" about the Danes.
""The whole match plan, defence, offence. We know about Denmark and how we will play them,"" he said.
The 24-year-old looked forward to the match in his home stadium on Saturday, saying Dortmund's usual yellow wall would become a ""wall of white.""
While Tah's absence will force Nagelsmann's hand, he may be tempted to replace Arsenal forward Kai Havertz with Niclas Fuellkrug, who has scored twice off the bench so far.
Since making his debut aged 29 in 2022, Fuellkrug has 13 goals to Havertz's seven - with the Dortmund striker normally coming off the bench.
Fuellkrug, who was playing second division football just two seasons ago, said he was not concerned about his role as supersub.
""The title is so much more important than the individual.""

As
Bunyore Starlets prepare to face FKF Women Premier League leaders Kenya Police
Bullets Wednesday, June 26, 2024, at the Jomo Kenyatta Mamboleo Stadium, Kisumu,
coach Timothy Ondeko observes that the season has been bumpy and unpredictable
to the Mumboha-based side.
Ondeko
says his wish was to finish among the top five teams in the league, since he
was leading a top-tier team for the first time.
However, the
former MMUST offensive midfielder observes that lapses at Bunyore Starlets camp
coupled with injuries derailed that dream, after his charges escaped relegation
by a whisker last season where they finished position nine.
Bunyore
Starlets are currently seventh on the log with 17 points, and a win will push
them one step closer to their sixth place target.
“This
being my first time in the FKF-WPL in a coaching capacity, I have learnt my
lessons. I now understand the strengths of our opponents. If I will still be at
Bunyore Starlets next season I know where to begin from, especially signing
quality players and enhancing the squad’s depth,” stated Ondeko.
“I
don’t know the outcome of the Kenya Police Bullets match but I hope we beat
them to finish in sixth position. That would give us a better starting point.
Anyway, Bunyore Starlets lapses this season were majorly as a result of
injuries and financial constraints, which if addressed we can redeem ourselves
next season,” he added.
The Bunyore Starlets tactician
admitted that he needs to beef up his squad, noting that he currently has only
15 players ready for the Police Bullets clash on Wednesday.

Security was on Thursday beefed up around key government
installations such as parliament buildings, the supreme court and the office of
the president and office of the deputy president in Nairobi.
All roads leading to critical infrastructure were cordoned
off, with staffers subjected to mandatory screening before being allowed
access.
Unlike Tuesday when protesters stormed Parliament buildings,
armoured personnel carriers patrolled the precincts of Parliament, with Police
Water Cannon Trucks on standby outside Parliament Buildings.
The leader of the Minority Party in the Senate Stewart Madzayo,
who was among the legislators who accessed the buildings complained about the heavy
security deployment.
“There is too much security installation, parliament should
not be a barracks; members cannot even access the premise,” said Madzayo.
The Supreme Court which also bore the brunt of violent
demonstrations on Tuesday was also heavily guarded.
Other than patrolling the Supreme Court vicinity using
horses, other officers used vehicles with some on foot.
Traffic towards the Supreme Court was also diverted with
regional police bosses intensifying patrols.
The office of the Governor and Kenyatta International Convention
Center (KICC) were also under heavy guard, with the multi-agency team cordoned
off City Hall Way to secure the premises.
The deployment was replicated along Harambee Avenue, which
has the office of the President, the Office of the Deputy President and a number of
Ministries adjacent to it.
Police mounted roadblocks along all State House Access
routes, almost 3 kilometres from State House Nairobi. Staffers and residents
around State House Nairobi were also subjected to mandatory screening by
authorities.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/us-health-agency-issues-dengue-virus-infection-advisory-n344813,"US health agency issues dengue virus infection advisory
The U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention has issued a health advisory warning the public and
healthcare officials about the increasing risk of dengue virus infections in
the United States.
The U.S. territory of Puerto Rico has declared a public
health emergency with almost 1,500 cases.
There has also been a record 745 cases among U.S. travelers
this year, the CDC said.
The CDC advisory issued on Tuesday said the 9.7 million
dengue cases reported in the Americas this year are more than twice the 4.6
million recorded last year.
The 2024 global incidence of dengue, a disease spread by bites of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, is the highest on record, according to the CDC.
That trend is being fueled by the
warmer temperatures brought about by climate change, officials say.
Dengue is usually more common in tropical and subtropical
climates.
The CDC urged healthcare providers to be increasingly
suspicious of people with fevers who have recently visited areas known to have
frequent or continuous dengue transmissions.
The CDC also called for healthcare providers to order the
appropriate detection tests and report the results promptly to public health
authorities.
In addition, the U.S. agency advised healthcare workers
""to promote mosquito bite prevention measures"" among people and also
travelers who live or visit areas where there is ""frequent or continuous
dengue transmission.""
Dengue infections are often asymptomatic or can sometimes
produce a mild illness. However, dengue can sometimes manifest as a severe
illness that can cause death.
The World Health Organization says that after a fever from
dengue has subsided, other symptoms can emerge, including severe abdominal
pain, persistent vomiting, rapid breathing, bleeding gums or nose, fatigue,
restlessness, blood in vomit or stool, severe thirst, pale and cold skin and
weakness.
While there is no specific treatment for dengue, WHO said
most cases are treated with pain medication, but recuperation can take several
weeks.
In 2000, WHO reported 505,430 global dengue cases. Nineteen
years later, that figure jumped to at least 5.2 million cases.
WHO cautioned that figure was likely an underestimation of the cases, as dengue is often underreported and misdiagnosed.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/new-pm-starmer-pledges-to-rebuild-britain-after-years-of-chaos-n345296,"New PM Starmer pledges to rebuild Britain after years of chaos
Standing outside his new office and residence at Number 10 Downing Street, Starmer acknowledged the scale of the challenge after his party's landslide victory in a parliamentary election ended 14 years of often tumultuous Conservative government.
He warned that any improvements would take time, and he would need to first rebuild faith in politics.
""This lack of trust can only be healed by actions, not words. I know that,"" he said.
""Whether you voted Labour or not, in fact, especially if you did not, I say to you directly - My government will serve you. Politics can be a force for good. We will show that.""
Starmer was greeted by huge cheers and took time before making his speech to shake hands with and hug aides and well-wishers who lined Downing Street - scenes that were reminiscent of Labour predecessor Tony Blair's arrival in government in 1997.
Standing behind a lectern, he said he understood that many Britons were disillusioned with politics after years of scandal and chaos under the Conservatives, who were roundly rejected in Thursday's election, suffering a historic loss.
Starmer said the rejection signalled that Britain was ready for a reset: ""Because no matter how fierce the storms of history, one of the great strengths of this nation has always been our ability to navigate away to calmer waters.""
MASSIVE MAJORITY
The centre-left Labour won a massive majority in the 650-seat parliament, prompting Rishi Sunak's resignation on Friday morning, before Starmer went to meet King Charles and be formally named prime minister.
He said he would fight every day to rebuild trust, saying Britain would have a ""government unburdened by doctrine"", underlining something he had repeated during the campaign - that he would put country first, party second.
""To defy, quietly, those who have written our country off. You have given us a clear mandate, and we will use it to deliver change.""
The election result has upended British politics. Labour won more than 410 seats, an increase of 211, while the Conservatives, the western world's most successful party, lost 250 lawmakers, including a record number of senior ministers and former Prime Minister Liz Truss.
Sunak's Conservatives suffered the worst performance in the party's long history as voters punished them for a cost of living crisis, failing public services and a series of scandals.
""To the country I would like to say first and foremost I am sorry,"" Sunak said outside Downing Street, adding he would stay as Conservative leader until the party was ready to appoint his replacement.
""I have given this job my all, but you have sent a clear signal that the government of the United Kingdom must change, and yours is the only judgment that matters. I have heard your anger, your disappointment and I take responsibility for this loss.""
TOUGH ROAD AHEAD
Despite Starmer's convincing victory, polls suggested there was little enthusiasm for Starmer or his party. Thanks to the quirk of Britain's first-past-the-post system and a low turnout, Labour's triumph was achieved with fewer votes than it secured in 2017 and 2019 - the latter its worst result in terms of seats won for 84 years.
The pound and British stocks and government bonds rose marginally on Friday, but Starmer comes to power at a time when the country is facing a series of daunting challenges.
Britain's tax burden is set to hit its highest since just after World War Two, net debt is almost equivalent to annual economic output, living standards have fallen, and public services are creaking, especially the much cherished National Health Service which has been dogged by strikes.
Some of Labour's more ambitious plans, such as its flagship green spending pledges, have already been scaled back, while Starmer has promised not to raise taxes for ""working people"".
Likewise, he has promised to scrap the Conservative's policy of sending asylum seekers to Rwanda, but with migration a key electoral issue, he will be under pressure himself to find a way to stop tens of thousands of people arriving across the Channel from France on small boats.
""I don't promise you it will be easy,"" Starmer said earlier at a victory rally. ""Changing a country is not like flicking a switch. It's hard work. Patient, determined, work, and we will have to get moving immediately.""
His first appointments to his top team of ministers contained no surprises.
Rachel Reeves was named as Britain's first female finance minister, Angela Rayner was made deputy prime minister and David Lammy was appointed foreign minister, all keeping the policy briefs they had held in opposition.
Britain's election result showed growth in support for the right-wing Reform party, led by Nigel Farage, echoing recent similar results in Europe where the far-right have been surging.
But, unlike France where Marine Le Pen's National Rally party made historic gains in an election last Sunday, overall the British public has plumped for a centre-left party to bring about change.
Starmer has promised to improve relations with the European Union after Brexit, but Labour has said rejoining the EU was not on the table.
He may also have to work with Trump if he wins November's presidential election. Trump has already sent congratulations to Farage, via his social media platform Truth Social.
While he has promised to bring change domestically, Starmer has vowed to continue London's unequivocal support for Ukraine in its war against Russia. On many foreign issues, his policies are similar to Sunak's.
The election victory represents an incredible turnaround for Starmer and Labour, which critics and supporters said was facing an existential crisis just three years ago when it appeared to have lost its way after its 2019 drubbing.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/auditor-general-raises-red-flag-over-hustler-fund-management-n345459,"Auditor General raises red flag over Hustler Fund management
Dr. Gathungu issued a disclaimer opinion, citing inconsistencies in the management of the fund.
She highlighted that the Hustler Fund Management failed to provide financial statements for audit review, which prevented verification of the source and authenticity of the balances.
This omission underscored significant shortcomings in the fund's transparency and accountability measures.
In her detailed report, the Auditor General pointed to doubts surrounding the recovery process from exchange transactions.
\Her analysis revealed that 17,855,858 beneficiaries applied for loans, amounting to a total disbursement of Ksh 32,015,962,276.
However, a substantial balance of Ksh 10,950,075,614 remained unpaid as of June 2023, including interest receivable and loans outstanding.
Dr. Gathungu also conducted a review of balances across multiple bank accounts and mobile network operators linked to the fund.
She found that Ksh 259,026,553 held by service providers could not be confirmed due to inadequate documentation provided by the fund's management.
Additionally, the Auditor General noted discrepancies in the disclosure of bank account signatories and their specimen signatures, which were essential for the audit review process.
These lapses further compounded the challenges in validating the financial activities of the Hustler Fund.
Further scrutiny revealed that the fund exceeded its set limits in loan disbursements. Dr. Gathungu identified 238,707 cases where loans totaling Ksh 420,312,323 were issued, surpassing the initial limit by Ksh 219,615,242.
Among these recipients were 5,070 individuals who were ineligible for loans under the fund's guidelines.
The report also detailed instances where 11,213 borrowers received additional loans totaling Ksh 161,931,703 before fully repaying their previous obligations.
Furthermore, Dr. Gathungu flagged 129,315 closed accounts holding Ksh 81,622,289, where loan repayments could not be traced, indicating inadequate tracking and accountability measures.
Additionally, the Auditor General identified 867 instances of duplicate loan identity numbers, which processed 1,978 loans amounting to Ksh 477,928.
This finding highlighted systemic deficiencies in the fund's loan management system configuration and oversight.
In response to these revelations, the Ministry of Cooperatives and MSMEs acknowledged several challenges during the fund's inception, including understaffing, errors in notes numbering, data extraction issues, missing data dumps, and overall extraction challenges.
These factors contributed to the operational hurdles faced by the Hustler Fund, as outlined in the Auditor General's report.
The findings by Dr. Gathungu have cast doubt on the integrity and effectiveness of one of President William Ruto's flagship projects.
What was initially heralded as a key initiative now stands under scrutiny, with implications that it may evolve into yet another scandal for the administration.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/i-have-had-to-sit-that-girl-down-president-ruto-speaks-on-karen-nyamus-public-conduct-n345290,"‘I have had to sit that girl down': President Ruto speaks on Karen Nyamu’s public conduct
Ruto who spoke during an X Space Engagement Forum on Friday was responding to a question by a user who called out nominated Senator Karen Nyamu for always hitting media headlines for the wrong reasons.
The user wondered why she was still holding a public office despite her lack of modesty and display of a lavish lifestyle.
In his response, the President acknowledged concerns about Nyamu, saying that in some instances, he has been forced to engage her personally, and even asked her to reform.
“I agree that some of our officials are arrogant, some of them speak out of fun, and some display obnoxious opulence if I may say which does not just anger the public, sometimes I call some of those people and give them a piece of my mind,” said Ruto.
“Even Nyamu, I have had an occasion to sit her down and tell her that she needs to change what she is doing.”
According to Ruto, he has engaged the outspoken Senator regarding her public image and even advised her to consider taking a different approach in the way she carries herself.
The president attributed Nyamu’s behaviour to 'excitement', which he said often results from young people assuming high positions of power.
Ruto added that as the head of state, he at times has to take up the position of parenthood to mentor young leaders and not necessarily kick them out of office.
“When you are in my position you are also a father figure and some of these young people get excited about many things and sometimes do the wrong things and I know someone mentioned Karen Nyamu,” Ruto noted.
“She is a girl I have had to sit down and tell her, look, you need to do things differently. I know what is going on and I have promised that I will be making changes.”
Since assuming office in 2022, Nyamu has hit several times hit headlines for the wrong reasons.
In 2022, the President Ruto-led UDA party was forced to summon Senator Karen Nyamu over a viral video which showed her in a public altercation at a party in Dubai.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/what-makes-hurricane-beryl-so-exceptional-n345113,"What makes Hurricane Beryl so exceptional?
Here's what to know about the hurricane, which -- powered by hotter than average ocean temperatures -- scientists are describing as unprecedented but perhaps not unexpected in the era of climate change.
- Unusual placement -
Beryl formed on Friday southeast of the Antilles, rapidly becoming a Category 1 storm by Saturday.
It's ""the furthest east a hurricane has ever formed this early in the year,"" Brian McNoldy, a hurricane researcher at the University of Miami, wrote in a blog post.
Waters in that part of the Atlantic are typically too cold to support hurricanes this time of year, Andra Garner, a climate scientist at Rowan University, told AFP.
- Rapid intensification -
Less than 24 hours later, by Sunday, Beryl became a major Category 4 storm.
""It's hard to communicate how unbelievable this is,"" McNoldy wrote.
""It's startling to see this happen before your eyes, but it's also kind of in line with what the science tells us we might expect in a warmer world,"" added Garner.
""While it is unprecedented, I can't say that it's unexpected.""
- Earlier than ever -
Beryl also broke a record when it became a Category 4 storm: A hurricane of that level had never been recorded in the Atlantic in June.
By the first day of July, a day later, it broke records again, as the earliest ever Category 5 hurricane.
The North Atlantic hurricane season runs from the beginning of June to the end of November.
According to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, major storms -- Category 3 and above -- usually form around the end of August or beginning of September.
- Unusually warm Atlantic waters -
The driving principle behind these factors is the temperature of the Atlantic Ocean, which has been at record levels for more than a year.
Warm waters ""can allow the storm to get going and to strengthen,"" said Garner.
""And when those waters are extra warm, warmer than we expect, it's kind of like having an extra shot of caffeine in your coffee.""
North Atlantic waters are currently between 2 and 5 degrees Fahrenheit (1 and 3 degrees Celsius) warmer than normal, according to NOAA.
Temperatures in May were close to those typically expected in August.
Beryl is ""almost exactly what we do expect, from a climate science perspective,"" said Garner.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/siombi-msamaha-mp-mutai-says-doesnt-regret-supporting-2024-finance-bill-n344979,"‘Siombi msamaha!’ MP Mutai says doesn’t regret supporting 2024 Finance Bill
Addressing his constituents in a roadside meet-up, Mutai said he does not regret voting 'Yes' to the Bill.
""Right now the Molo MP cannot hold a rally like this one. I voted Yes na siombi msamaha. Because I knew that Yes would bring this road, that Yes would bring development here,"" Mutai said.
He warned Molo constituency residents that they would regret attacking their MP and opposing the Finance Bill, claiming they would not benefit from development.
""If there is a constituency that has really benefited, then it is Molo constituency. There is no bad road in Molo, every part of Molo has power connectivity. But if destroying their MP's property is how they give back, ole wao!"" Mutai asserted.
He added that if the Molo constituents do not want their MP to hold the National Assembly Finance Committee chairmanship, then President Ruto can ""hand it to the Kuresoi constituency because they are ready for development.""
Mutai warned that the recent cleansing prayers conducted by the clergy at Kuria's home would have consequences for the attackers.
""We condemn the attack and pray that the cleansing will do something to those who destroyed Kuria's property. Why steal chicken and cattle, and burn cars?"" he quipped.
Kuria Kimani is among some of the MPs whose homes and property were attacked and destroyed by angry Kenyans over their support for the Finance Bill.
The Bill has since been dropped by President William Ruto, who nonetheless insists that it was good for the country.
Ruto changed his hard-line stance when protestors stormed parliament and destroyed property, setting some parts on fire on June 25.

A section of residents in Kangemi have raised concern over lack of proper sanitation in the area.
Speaking to Citizen Digital, locals called on the relevant authorities to address their concerns.
Residents said the chocking garbage from a neglected dumpsite is a danger to their health.
They added that heaps of garbage remain uncollected, as their pleas fall on deaf ears.
“We have for a long time asked the county government to intervene to no avail,” residents said.
Some said their visits to hospitals have been more frequent, amid a scare of contracting waterborne diseases.
Mothers and caregivers in the area said the sorry state is a concern to them given that their children play in the area.
School-going children have also been affected as the feeder roads have been rendered impassable.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/its-a-possibility-ruto-on-firing-members-of-his-advisory-board-n344991,"'It's a possibility': Ruto on firing members of his advisory board
During a round-table discussion with digital journalists at State House Nairobi on Sunday, President Ruto seemingly admitted to seeking the counsel of ill-informed advisors who have contributed to the governance decisions his government has adopted.
Responding to dropping a few advisors and help assuage Kenyans' dejections, Ruto noted that there is room to ponder on who will bid goodbye to the board.
""It is something to think about it is something that will exercise my mind. I have heard you and it is something I will think about going into the future. That's a possibility,"" he said.
Calls for Ruto's resignation have taken centre stage during the two-week-long demonstrations as youthful Kenyans lament poor governance and rampant wastage of public resources.
Some of the demands are cutting down on expenditure, scrapping off offices including that of the First and Second Lady, and reducing salaries for Kenyan legislators among others.
The protests started with the call for rejecting the Finance Bill 2024 which proposed unbearable taxes but escalated to going against the government after Ruto refused to append his signature on the Bill.
Ruto has emphasized that he is committed to effecting the recommended changes only in the presence of dialogue with dejected Kenyans.
The street protests are set to take stage again on Tuesday, July 2, and Thursday as Ruto has promised to urge officers to avoid using brutal force on peaceful protesters.

Negotiations to secure a ceasefire in the Gaza war will resume in Doha on Wednesday, with the intelligence chiefs of Egypt, the United States, and Israel in attendance, Egypt's state-affiliated Al-Qahera News TV and sources said on Tuesday.
The Egyptian security delegation in Doha, led by intelligence chief Abbas Kamel, will be ""on a mission to bring viewpoints closer between Hamas and Israel in order to reach a truce agreement as soon as possible"", Al-Qahera News quoted a senior source as saying.
""There is an agreement over many points,"" the source said, adding the negotiations will be back in Cairo on Thursday.
Israel's spy chief David Barnea will also attend the meeting, a source close to the talks who spoke on condition of anonymity told Reuters.
The Israeli Prime Minister's Office declined comment to a Reuters query.
U.S. Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns will also attend, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters, after he met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in Cairo on Tuesday.
Sisi affirmed in the meeting the Egyptian position ""rejecting the continuation of military operations in the Gaza Strip,"" the presidency said in a statement.
Egypt and Qatar have been spearheading mediation in the nine-month-old war between Israel and Hamas in hopes of ending the fighting and securing the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.
Senior U.S. officials were in the region to push for a ceasefire after Hamas made concessions last week, but the Palestinian militant group said a new Israeli assault on Gaza on Monday threatened truce talks at a crucial moment, and it urged mediators to rein in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Sisi stressed in his meeting with Burns the need to take ""serious and effective steps"" to prevent the expansion of the Gaza conflict in the wider region, the presidency added.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/sarah-gwan-video-vixens-mysterious-fall-from-balcony-4-day-battle-in-icu-n345043,"Sarah Gwan: Video vixen's mysterious fall from balcony, 4-day battle in ICU
Mary Wanjiru immediately got up from bed and realised that the door had been locked - and her daughter Sarah had gone with the padlock keys.
Quickly, and frantically, Wanjiru squeezed herself through a tight spare window overlooking her daughter's front balcony, screaming and shouting, waking up the entire apartment with her cries of terror.
Wanjiru managed to fit through the tight window, falling right across the corridor and dashing off to St. Francis Hospital where her daughter laid in a bad state.
Sarah Njogu, popularly known as Sarah Gwan, had fallen from the second floor balcony of an adjacent building in Seasons, Kasarani, after what appeared to have been indoors drama with her three friends - two women and one man.
Upon arrival at St. Francis, Wanjiru was met with a ghastly look of her daughter sprawled on the bed, with blood oozing from her ears. She had a cut on her head, too.
At that point, in the Emergency Room, Sarah was plugged into life-saving machines - but a decision was quickly made and Sarah had to be transferred to Kenyatta National Hospital.
Her father was preparing himself to leave for Nairobi from Karatina, after receiving a call at around 3am in the morning.
""I was asleep. I quickly got up and started preparing myself to go to Nairobi. I arrived at Nairobi at around 7am and went straight to Kasarani Police Station where I notified the police that my daughter had just fallen from a balcony and the family suspected that her friends were behind it all, "" Geoffrey Njogu says.
At Kasarani, the police advised Njogu to go to see his daughter, telling him that he could not record a statement before seeing his daughter's state first.
Upon arrival at St. Francis, Njogu says he dashed back to the Kasarani police station to report the matter, seeking to have Sarah's friends arrested immediately.
""At Kasarani, I was provided with two police officers who accompanied me to St. Francis Hospital where the three friends were arrested and booked at the station,"" he says.
At the same time, the family was running around desperately trying to transfer their daughter from St. Francis to Kenyatta National Hospital.
""We had to transfer her to Kenyatta because we had been asked for a Ksh.150,000 deposit at St. Francis and we did not have that money at that time,"" Njogu says.
Sarah's father went on to explain that, after her friends were initially arrested on Tuesday, they were released two days later on a Ksh. 60,000 cash bail each, with the police explaining that it was unreasonable to keep holding them beyond that point.
""Since they were released, they've not attempted to reach out to us, to condole with us, to visit the family or even call us. In fact, they had sent someone with suggestions that we needed to meet and settle the case out of court. A proposal we declined,"" Wanjiru says.
Four days after bravely fighting for her life, Sarah Gwan breathed her last at the Kenyatta Hospital, Saturday morning.
The family has flatly disputed the friends' report which appeared to indicate that the renowned video vixen intentionally threw herself to her death.
""I know my daughter. She was the strongest woman in my household. Sarah began her independence quite early in life, as a very young girl. She was very strong at heart and a go-getter. There is no way Sarah would kill herself. That's not the Sarah I knew,"" her mother said.
Backing up her mother was Purity Njogu, Sarah's sister, who also said that Sarah's mental state had always been upright and that her sister had never displayed any intentions to end her own life, despite any adversity.
""My sister was the strongest woman I knew. Sarah was not suicidal. She has been through hell and back and wasn't the type to end her own life and leave her daughter behind,"" she said.
""What concerns me most, actually, is that, we are told that one of Sarah's friends encouraged her to throw herself off the balcony. What kind of friend would encourage you to throw yourself off a balcony?""
Sarah Gwan, one of Kenya's most decorated video vixens, had appeared in multiple high-profile music videos. She had featured in songs by Redsan, Willy Paul, Bensoul, Ommy Dimpoz, Reckless and more.
Her female friends have only been identified with their first names, Angie and Vanessa. The third friend in the house by the time of Sarah's fall, a man, has not yet been identified.
The post-mortem is currently underway at the Kenyatta National Hospital. Officers from the homicide department are present.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/millions-of-funds-from-kenyans-sent-to-families-of-deceased-and-injured-protesters-n344860,"Millions of funds from Kenyans sent to families of deceased and injured protesters
The funds were channeled through an M-Changa account set up by social activist Hanifa Adan, who has since sent Ksh.2 million to go towards the funeral expenses of Rex and Evans, who were reportedly felled by police during the demonstrations.
Updating her followers and Kenyans in general on Friday morning, Hanifa took to her X account to share screenshots of the transactions - the families of both Rex Kanyike and Evans Kiratu both received Ksh.1 million each all meant for the two fallen protesters' funerals.
Earlier, Citizen Digital had reported that, in less than 8 hours, Kenyans managed to collectively fundraise over Ksh.2 million aimed at covering the two men's burial expenses.
The two young men succumbed to injuries sustained during the Thursday Occupy Parliament protests - Rex was shot and killed by police as the protests entered the night stretch while Evans was hit by a teargas canister, dying a few days later.
Led by X personality Kimuzi, and in collaboration with Osama Otero and Hanifa Adan, a team quickly came together to organise a fundraiser for both Rex and Evans, quickly setting up an M-CHANGA fundraiser early Sunday morning.
On X, Hanifa wrote: ""Hello guys. Remember Rex and Evan’s? The first victims of this cruel regime. We have sent one million each to their families that’s their mum. The remaining will be sent to the family of Ian, who was shot three times on the back and won’t be able to walk again. I feel so relieved that they got this. Thank you so much guys.""
And on Wednesday, Hanifa kicked off yet another fundraiser after the murderous events at the #TotalShutdown protests which went down on Tuesday and saw police indiscriminately fire live bullets into protesters who had breached parliament.
The fundraiser, dubbed 'Care For The Injured' quickly gained momentum, clocking over 20 million shillings in less than 20 hours. It has now collected a staggering Ksh. 24 million, less than two days later.
The activist has now revealed that the process to pay the hospital bills for all the affected parties had already kicked off, adding that she and her team were working directly with M-Changa to pay off huge bills for all injured protesters across the country.
She shared that the first payment from the 'Care for the Injured' kitty was made to Nairobi West Hospital - a bill totalling Ksh.629,000.
""The first payment was paid to Nairobi West Hospital. Mchanga isn’t charging for the bank-to-bank payments and Pauline had been extremely helpful I’m so relieved,"" she wrote.
She added, ""This is how it works with mchanga paying hospitals bills directly to the hospital. I upload the invoices and account details of the hospitals and they send to the hospitals. They will generate a PDF for all transactions.""
Media houses reported that at least five people were shot dead and around 31 were injured during Tuesday’s protests.
Of these, 13 were hit with live bullets, four with rubber bullets, and three with launcher canisters, according to a joint statement by Amnesty International Kenya, the Kenya Medical Association, the Law Society of Kenya, and Police Reforms Working Group Kenya.
Adding to the tally from Tuesday, eleven more people are nursing their wounds at the Homa Bay County Teaching and Referral Hospital after sustaining injuries during Thursday demonstrations.
The injured were nine people who sustained bullet wounds while two others were injured in a stampede.

https://www.citizen.digital/wananchi-reporting/wananchi-opinion-being-jobless-after-multiple-degrees-and-other-frustrations-that-lead-gen-z-to-boil-over-n344707,"WANANCHI OPINION: Being jobless 'after multiple degrees' and other frustrations that lead Gen Zs' anger to boil over
These economic pains just needed a little spark to lit fire and the Finance Bill 2024 just did that. The Generation Z has just vocalized and demonstrated the pains felt across generations. Today most families have someone or several looking for employment without success.
Many families have someone who has experienced one business failure or another as a result of market trends and economic conditions over time.
When I was growing up and in primary school in the 1980s, as pupils we used to admire secondary school students a lot as they looked informed, well dressed and their destiny looked to become great. Better still if they schooled in some of the top National and Provincial schools.
When those who got to A-levels were in the villages for holidays they looked to be people from another planet. We adored and almost looked with a mix of admiration, awe, fear and trepidation at those who got to the universities from the village. The whole world looked to be at their feet. Their future looked paved with platinum, diamond and gold.
It came for my time to get to secondary school and I ended in one of the best in the country then. It was a top provincial school that used to beat most national schools for a top ten position in the country on KCSE results. By the time I finished secondary school in the early 1990s we started hearing of challenges of getting jobs for some of the courses taken in universities. So fear started creeping in.
As I cleared KCSE there was a long period before getting admission to the public universities then usually around one and half years. My parents who were teachers and doing some farming and some businesses advised me that I should start off in college immediately. My father was informed and used to read newspapers a lot and he felt that the chances I had for success was to be over-educated and have top notch qualifications.
Therefore, I was enrolled in a top computer training college in Nairobi as I waited for admission to the University. By the time our year was admitted I already had a diploma in computer science and already enrolled for Accountancy onwards to qualifications as a CPA-K.
It also followed a series of university degrees and diploma courses and certificates just to insure against unemployment as I heeded my father’s advice. I ended up being a lifetime learner/scholar as a result that I often forget I do possess some of the qualifications. Some people including some relatives saw the folly in my father’s spending spree in my education and which he also extended to my siblings subsequently.
His actions were all meant to insulate against the unemployment crisis that was developing in Kenya. I followed the same habit of spending a lot to get more academic and professional qualifications that even now I’m still schooling.
With time I have seen the unemployment crisis getting worse and even at the time I finished university I had to ‘tarmac’ (look for jobs everywhere). To date a lot has happened and even the best of qualified university students in the country have been piling in the stock of unemployment.
Add this to all kinds of school leavers, some who have gone to college and others who have dropped out of the schooling system. The situation is worrying. Today if I check around former colleagues who I worked with in various companies, many of them have undergone one or more retrenchments. Other than probably in government sector or related organisations I probably know none who has not been retrenched.
I have seen many companies that were glittering downsize or close down. I have tried some businesses, even myself, some of which have closed down due to market and economic conditions. Among many of my friends and former colleagues they have bad stories to tell for having had to undergo business failures. There are many such and worse out there.
With an army of growing unemployment, times have been changing so dramatically that the youth and even not youthful people have been growing with anger. One time while I was still doing my undergraduate degree I felt so bad for a close relative to arrogantly tell me that we are schooling hard but we will not get jobs but may end up being conmen or thieves. It was so painful while this was clearly a warning shot but done in a condescending, hubris filled, demeaning and a bad language. I usually feel bad for people as I have also undergone retrenchments but survived back to work perhaps due to some luck, tenacity, persistence or the qualifications combined work experiences and skills have been paying off.
In a nutshell what I’m pointing out is there is no way to mollify the population in an era so many people are suffering economic pains. What we are witnessing is an explosion of economic pains driven anger. It can get worse. I think the government needs to be very intentional and work on economic matters many times better than it has been doing. Times have changed a lot and Gen Z anger is not going anywhere out. Instead it is likely to metamorphose into a major political force.
We saw Senegal producing the youngest African president in Bassirou Diomaye Faye this year. That political force by the youth cannot be ignored nor destroyed even in our usually tribal engineered politics. Taxation in an era of plenty of economic pains is an area to tread carefully. Moreover, cuts in areas like in education funding are ill informed irrespective of where such advice is coming from- the IMF and/World Bank notwithstanding.
The world has to realize that times keep changing. The way you dealt with people previously may not work currently or in future. Latent anger is also dangerous and in the fast changing world where Science and Technology is evolving very fast, you can’t afford to sit back and watch or ignore people’s concerns. You have to be in the forefront providing requisite solutions that are acceptable. For instance, Kenya has to deal with corruption and wastage of public resources as these two alone are some of the biggest undoing.

Published on: June 25, 2024 03:32 (EAT)
Multiple world rally champion Sebastien Ogier and his co-driver Vincent Landais have been taken to hospital following an accident during preparations for the Rally of Poland, their team announced Tuesday.
""Seb and Vincent have been involved in a road accident during reconnaissance for Rally Poland and have been taken for medical checks,"" Toyota Gazoo Racing WRT said on X.
Tomasz Markowski, spokesman for the local police, told AFP an investigation had been launched into the incident, which took place near Goldap in north-east Poland.
""Two cars were on a road which will be used for the rally,"" he said.
""The pilot and the co-pilot were in one of the cars. In the second car there were the 69-year-old driver and a 67-year-old female passenger.
""All of them were injured and said they were in pain.
""The drivers were both taken to hospital by helicopter and the passengers in an ambulance.""
Ogier, 40, and Landais, 32, had been cherry picking their events this season, though, the eight-time world champion sits fourth in the overall standings having won two successive rallies, Croatia, at the end of April, and Portugal in mid-May.
The Rally of Poland is scheduled for June 27-30.

Gilbert Selebwa, head coach of National Super League (NSL) side Luanda Villa says he has achieved his objective after a one month stint at the Mumboha based Club.
Luanda Villa ended their 2023/24 NSL campaign with a 2-1 home win against Dimba Patriots FC at Mumboha Sports and he took time to laud his players “for following instructions that enabled them meet the objective of finishing among the top 10 teams in the National Super League”
The final day win saw them finish at position eight with 52 points, one behind Dimba Patriots FC whom they beat on Sunday courtesy of goals from Moses Masinde and Gerishom Osumba.
“I would admit that I found the team in good condition a month ago when I took over from Tom Tera. That’s why I have not made changes in the squad but we managed our top target,” he said, explaining that, “The premier league became too ambitious for us this season.”
“This area has football talent. Next season we must get more experienced players to boost the club’s ambitions of qualifying to play in the premier league immediately after next season,” he added.
Mr Selebwa at the same time decried his charges inability to convert chances despite transitioning well from the previous play style to now building up their play from behind.
“The players have relaxed and can build the game from behind. We need a more clinical striking force to convert the chances we create,” he stated, adding that Luanda Villa's transition has been slow but steady over the years promising to ensure the team makes it into the premier league.
“Fans had high expectations in Luanda Villa only that they will have to be patient so that the technical bench by the help of the management can address the team’s weakness before we begin our KPL campaign next season. It goes without saying that we will need resources to sign more experienced players,” he added.

During parliamentary proceedings, Minority leader Opiyo Wandayi claimed receiving a call at 2:30 am from Oguda who said that police officers were breaking into his house.
Wandayi noted that his attempts to gather a battalion of lawyers proved futile as his phone calls were jammed.
He called on the Speaker to wield his power and ensure Oguda alongside other activists who were captured are released.
“I was unable to make or receive phone calls until 6:30 a.m. They broke into his compound, broke his house’s door and abducted him,” Wandayi divulged and noted that frantic efforts to search for him inside police stations in Nairobi were in vain.
“We do not know his whereabouts and don’t take it lightly.”
In a rejoinder, Majority leader Kimani Ichung’wah committed to follow up on the matter with Inspector General of Police Japhet Koome to determine whether Oguda is in police custody.
“Let us not create an impression that MPs are immune to the law, we must all be treated equally. Let me commit that as soon as we’re done, I will check with the police IG whether the said officer is in the hands of the police so that we avoid speculations,” Ichung’wah said.
Wandayi also listed seven other youth who were abducted in the past week including Osama Otero, Drey Mwangi, Temper CR7, Harriet, France, Shad Khalif and Wordsmith.
He called on IG Koome to reveal the whereabouts of the listed Kenyans.
The anti-Finance Bill protests continued in the second week as the youth took to the streets to demonstrate against the bill.
This has led to running battles between police officers and demonstrators throughout the CBD.

The decedents, reports say, were transporting Muguka, despite a ban imposed on the stimulant in the coastal region.
Witnesses report the vehicle was going beyond the speed limit heading to Ukunda and Diani where the driver reportedly lost control of the vehicle, rolling several times.
Kwale County security department confirmed the accident, stating that further investigations will be launched to ascertain the cause of the crash.
According to Kwale County's projects director and disaster coordinator, Chakaya Ronald, Kwale County has controlled the use of muguka by doubling the taxes.
The move has forced leading muguka traders to use alternative methods to conduct their business.

Published on: June 28, 2024 11:05 (EAT)
General Alain-Guillaume Bunyoni
Burundi's Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the life sentence handed down to the country's former prime minister, General Alain-Guillaume Bunyoni, a judicial source told AFP.
Once one of the most powerful regime figures, Bunyoni was prime minister from mid-2020 until September 2022, when he was fired, days after President Evariste Ndayishimiye had warned of an alleged coup plot against him.
He was sentenced in December to life in prison on a raft of charges including using witchcraft to threaten the president's life, destabilising the economy and illegal enrichment.
""Emmanuel Gateretse, the president of the Supreme Court... confirmed the ruling of the first judge for General Bunyoni and added a fine of 22.7 billion Burundi francs ($7.8 million) as well as the immediate confiscation of his undeclared assets,"" said a judicial source who requested anonymity.
The former prime minister may still appeal to the Supreme Court, said a legal expert, who also requested anonymity.
At his appeal trial at the end of May, General Bunyoni again pleaded not guilty to all charges and asked to be ""purely and simply acquitted"".
Since taking power in June 2020, Ndayishimiye has been lauded by the international community for gradually ending years of Burundi's isolation under Nkurunziza's chaotic and bloody rule.
But he has failed to improve Burundi's dire human rights record and the country remains one of the poorest on the planet.

Switzerland midfielder Michel Aebischer said Euro 2024 last 16 opponents Italy ""hate to lose"" and said his side would be the underdog in Berlin on Saturday.
Switzerland had been on track to top their group but qualified second in Group A behind Germany after conceding a Niclas Fuellkrug header in injury time on Sunday.
Aebischer moved to Bologna from Young Boys Bern in 2022 and said his time with the Serie A side had given him an insight into the Italian football mindset.
""The Italians hate to lose,"" he said.
""They are the reigning champions, they never give up... Italy are the favourite -- there's nothing more to say.""
After the group phase, several tournament favourites including Germany, Portugal, Spain and France are now on the other side of the draw to the Swiss.
The 27-year-old however dismissed suggestions Switzerland had an easy ride, with England potentially waiting for them in the quarter-finals.
""Of course, we saw that there are many big names in the other half of the table. But from the round of 16 onwards there are no easy opponents anyway.""
Aebischer said England ""fell short of expectations"" but added ""I think they will improve now.""

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/france-hoping-captain-kylian-can-deliver-against-spain-in-euro-2024-semi-n345433,"France hoping captain Kylian can deliver against Spain in Euro 2024 semi
France go into Tuesday's Euro 2024 semi-final showdown against
Spain hoping Kylian Mbappe can finally produce a performance worthy of his
superstar status at a tournament in which he has struggled to find form and
fitness.
The match in Munich is a mouthwatering prospect and a huge
occasion in particular for Mbappe, in his first major tournament captaining his
country and just before he starts a new chapter in his career at Real Madrid.
At 25, and having just completed his dream move to the Champions
League winners, Mbappe should be in the prime of his footballing life.
But the man who won the World Cup as a teenager and scored an
incredible hat-trick in the 2022 final in Qatar, has not been able to play
anywhere near his best at the European Championship.
Mbappe joined up with the France squad after a difficult final
campaign at Paris Saint-Germain which was marred by a slightly messy divorce
from the club as his playing time was reduced.
Already floundering to some extent physically, lacking his usual
explosive edge, a broken nose in Les Bleus' opening game at the tournament
against Austria has further diminished him.
He has scored just once, from a penalty, at the Euros and it may
be no exaggeration to say his performance in Friday's quarter-final against
Portugal in Hamburg was the worst of his career in such a big game.
Mbappe ended up being substituted halfway through extra time -- he
later admitted he was simply exhausted -- and so watched from the sidelines as
his teammates won on penalties.
""He might not have been here at all, so we need to look at it
in a positive light,"" coach Didier Deschamps told broadcaster TF1 on
Sunday.
""Kylian is here, even if he is not at 100 percent, and I know
that has an impact on the opposition who are forced to adapt to him.""
Whether Spain are too worried remains to be seen, with Mbappe
clearly inhibited by the protective mask he has to wear over his injured nose.
There is little prospect of him challenging for a header, and he
has indicated that his field of vision is reduced by the mask.
His poor form, along with that of vice-captain Antoine Griezmann,
helps explain why France have scored just three goals in five games on their
run to the semi-final -- one being Mbappe's penalty against Poland and the
other two coming via own goals.
- 'When he talks, we listen' -
However, Mbappe's teammates insist they are not worried about
their captain's performances.
""I don't think he is going through a bad period. He had a
great season. If he is not scoring goals we need to help him. The competition
is not over. Apart from his little nose, he is fine,"" said Randal Kolo
Muani, who played with Mbappe at PSG in the last campaign, on Sunday.
Mbappe is France's third-top scorer of all time with 48 goals in
83 appearances, but he has just two in his last nine caps.
In the meantime, he has settled into the role of captain which he
was given after Hugo Lloris retired in the wake of the 2022 World Cup.
On Friday, after being substituted, television cameras caught
Mbappe giving a rousing speech to his teammates just before the penalty
shoot-out against Portugal.
""Kylian is the player who went through one-on-one three times
in a World Cup final,"" said midfielder Youssouf Fofana in reference to his
hat-trick against Argentina in Doha.
""So when he talks about penalties before a shoot-out, we
listen to him.""
Mbappe is also very much at ease in front of the media, and has
notably used the platform given to him in pre-game press conferences to talk
politics, making clear his opposition to the far-right National Rally in relation
to the French parliamentary elections.
He is a natural leader, but it is goals that this shot-shy France
team want more than anything from him.
Mbappe will not come directly up against one of his future club
colleagues against Spain, with right-back Dani Carvajal suspended after his
sending-off against Germany in the quarter-finals.
Whoever
replaces Carvajal, Mbappe will hope to come out on top and lead France to a
third final in the last four major tournaments.

A section of opposition leaders now want
Inspector General of Police Japhet Koome to resign with immediate effect
following the killing of protesters in the country.
The
leaders drawn from the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya coalition accuse President
William Ruto's administration of using excessive force against protesters
leading to deaths.
They
were speaking at the funeral of Daniel Kakai, a student who was shot during the
anti-Finance Bill 2024 protests in Bungoma, demanding for action to be taken
against the security officers involved.
The
funeral of Kakai, a student of St Veronica Siritanyi High School was held at
his home in Masuno Village in Bumula Constituency.
“Ameanza
kuwaongelesha jana…kwanza tunataka IG Koome akome kuwa IG wa Kenya…polisi
washikwe waliouwa watoto wetu,” said DAP-K party leader Eugene Wamalwa.
“We
started by telling Ruto things are bad hasikii...World Bank told him things are
bad hasikii....sasa imebidi hawa watoto wadogo Gen Z wamuambie ukweli kwa
maandamano na tuko nyuma yenu,” added Bumula MP Jack Wamboka.
Kakai
is one of the youths who died following gunshot wounds during the protests to
pressure the government to drop the taxation proposals that were contained in
the expunged Finance Bill, 2024.
Gen-Zs
who attended to mourn their fellow youth vowed to soldier on to push the
government to address their pressing issues.
A
few kilometres away in Buko Village, Kimilili, Bungoma County, 21-year-old
Wilson Sitati, a young man who was shot at a protest in Nairobi, was also laid
to rest.
Here,
the police and their command again were on the receiving end.
“The
invasion of Parliament by our young generation is not something to condemn but
to draw lessons from,” said Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa.
Sirisia
MP John Waluke added, “Sisi kama viongozi wenu hatufurahii watu wetu

President
Ruto, while addressing the nation on Friday, said the government will
compensate families who have lost their loved ones in the anti-government

https://www.citizen.digital/tech/meta-says-it-may-block-news-from-facebook-in-australia-n344938,"Meta says it may block news from Facebook in Australia
Meta's regional policy director Mia Garlick told lawmakers ""all options are on the table"" when asked if the company would block Australians from sharing news content to avoid paying fees.
""There's a large number of channels that people can get news content from,"" Garlick told the inquiry.
She said Meta was waiting for Canberra to decide if it would apply an untested 2021 law which gives the government the right to set the fees U.S. tech giants pay media outlets for links.
The comments are the strongest indication so far that Meta would take the same hard-line approach in Australia it took in Canada in 2023 when that country introduced similar laws.
Meta struck deals with Australian media firms including News Corp and the Australian Broadcasting Corp when the law was brought in Australia, but has since said it will not renew those arrangements beyond 2024.
It now falls on Australia's assistant treasurer to decide whether to step in and force Facebook to pay for news content. The assistant treasurer has said he is still collecting advice but that Meta seems to respect the law only when it suits.
Australia's two largest free-to-air television broadcasters, Nine Entertainment and Seven West Media meanwhile said this week they were cutting jobs, citing loss of revenue once their deals with Meta expire.
Asked on Friday if blocking news from Facebook in Australia would amount to sidestepping the law, Meta's Garlick said taking that action would be complying with it.
""Every other law - tax laws, safety laws, privacy laws - we work to comply with,"" she said. ""It's just compliance would look slightly different in relation to this law if it's fully enacted.""
Garlick defended Meta's processes for Australians to complain if they believed the company was spreading harmful misinformation or scams, although she said its content moderation centres were all in other countries.
Asked about Australian mining billionaire Andrew Forrest, who is suing Meta for showing cryptocurrency scam advertisements featuring his face, Garlick said the company had processes in place to detect and stop scams, but ""there are a lot of challenges"".
How could Meta call itself an advertising business when ""some ads sell lies"", asked Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young.
""We have policies and systems and tools to do everything we can to prevent those ads,"" Garlick replied.

In the request for an advisory opinion, IEBC seeks the intervention of the Supreme Court on whether it can undertake the process of delimitation of electoral boundaries and other electoral processes in the absence of commissioners or requisite quorum of commissioners.
IEBC in the advisory seeks direction on whether it can review names and boundaries of constituencies and wards at intervals of 8 years and not more than 12 years which shall be completed at least 12 months before a general election of Members of the Parliament according to the Constitution.
A review of electoral boundaries ought to have finalized been on 6th March 2024, this falling on the 12th year since the last exercise on 6th March 2012.
The exercise has however been delayed for lack of commissioners, a situation which according to Attorney General Justin Muturi may lead to legal challenges and litigation
“Failure to undertake the delimitation may result in legal challenges and litigation and compromise constitutional rights to fair representation and participation in the electoral process,” Muturi noted.
Muturi further advised that the provisions of the Constitution should not be contravened under any circumstances and that compliance with the Constitution will help preserve integrity.
In appreciation of its current state, IEBC also seeks to understand whether the timelines that have already expired can be extended, and if so, by whom and under what circumstances.
Fallout at the commission during the 2022 Presidential results declaration saw the exit of three commissioners, Juliana Cherera, Francis Wanderi, and Justus Nyang’aya, while Irene Masit opted to face a tribunal which recommended her removal.
Wafula Chebukati, Abdi Guliye and Boya Molu’s non-renewable six-year term ended, leaving the commission without commissioners, rendering the poll body without any member of the commission.

At the 2024 Leadership Employability Advancement Possibility (LEAP) Summit on Friday, Danton Kipkirui (Moi University) and Sylvia Jebet were feted for their outstanding performance in Digital Content creation.
The talent programme, which admits students from various countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, equips them with digital skills to innovate and create technological solutions for their communities.
During the LEAP Summit, the technology company also feted Kenya’s Principal Secretary for Higher Education, Dr. Beatrice Muganda, for her work in the academic field.
Digital development plan
In 2022, Huawei unveiled the LEAP framework to guide digital talent development in Sub-Saharan Africa. As of June 2024, over 18,000 Africans have benefited from the programme which consists of skilling civil servants, ICT professionals, teachers, students and other practitioners in small and medium-sized enterprises.
Under the LEAP framework, Huawei trains its partners in digital power and cloud ecosystem, hosts training and incubations for teachers and also hosts job fairs.
Having trained over 18,000 people from Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Namibia, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, and other African countries, Huawei’s Sub-saharan Africa Executive Gao Xiang says the company now aims at skilling 150,000 people in the next three years.
In a panel discussion at the LEAP summit, PS Beatrice Muganda called for a holistic approach to digital upskilling, adding that technology companies need to pursue more partnerships with governments to encourage collaborative solutions.
“This will happen if you involve more of our experts, researchers, lecturers. Beyond focusing on students, lecturers also need to be engaged. If you can expand partnerships with other fields, we shall have everyone on board,” stated Muganda.
On her part, Dr.Amina Zawede, Uganda’s Chief Technology Officer called for supporting development of infrastructure to harness technological opportunities.
The DigiTruck initiative
Access to technological infrastructure and ICT skills has been a challenge for a number rural communities in Kenya, where key enablers such as power and network are scarce.
To counter this, Huawei launched the DigiTruck Initiative, where shipping containers are converted to mobile classrooms, where remote communities can obtain ICT skills.
The trucks have transversed remote communities in Kenya and Uganda, and are set for a similar tour in Tanzania and Nigeria.
This week, Foreign Affairs Principal Secretary Dr. Korir Singoei oversaw the graduation of more than 200 DigiTruck trainees in Trans Nzoia County.

https://www.citizen.digital/sports/murray-out-of-wimbledon-singles-but-set-to-play-doubles-n345051,"End of an era as Murray withdraws from Wimbledon singles
Two-time champion Andy Murray called time on his Wimbledon
singles career on Tuesday after the ""extremely disappointed"" former
world number one lost his battle to recover from back surgery.
However, the 37-year-old, who plans to retire after the
Paris Olympics, will still experience an emotional farewell to the All England
Club when he plays doubles with brother Jamie later in the tournament.
Murray underwent surgery to remove a cyst from his back last
month, a procedure he described as ""not insignificant"".
The operation left him without full feeling in his right leg
and placed in peril his final appearance at the tournament.
As a result Murray doubted if he would recover in time to
face Tomas Machac of the Czech Republic in his scheduled first-round clash on
Centre Court on Tuesday.
""Unfortunately, despite working incredibly hard on his
recovery since his operation just over a week ago, Andy has taken the very
difficult decision not to play the singles this year,"" said a statement
from Murray's representatives.
""As you can imagine, he is extremely disappointed but
has confirmed that he will be playing in the doubles with Jamie and looks
forward to competing at Wimbledon for the last time.""
Murray famously ended Britain's 77-year wait for a men's
champion at Wimbledon when he triumphed in 2013.
He added a second title in 2016, taking his career majors
total to three after breaking his duck at the 2012 US Open.
That win in New York came just weeks after he had lost his
first Wimbledon final to Roger Federer.
Murray, who has never been defeated in the first round at
Wimbledon, has not progressed past the quarter-finals since his 2016 triumph.
The physical stress of 20 years on the tour has taken its
toll.
He missed the 2018 tournament with injury and 12 months
later sat out the singles after undergoing hip surgery.
That year, he played men's doubles with Pierre-Hugues
Herbert and mixed doubles with Serena Williams.
Murray has competed with a metal hip since 2019 while this
season he damaged ankle ligaments in Miami when he went down to defeat to
Machac.
The Scot made his Wimbledon debut in 2005, reaching the
third round, where he took a two-set lead before losing in five to 2002
runner-up David Nalbandian.
Fellow three-time Grand Slam title winner Stan Wawrinka
hailed Murray as ""an amazing champion"".
""He pushed everybody. He won everything in the sport
that you can win. He's been No. 1. He's been an example for many players,""
said the 39-year-old Swiss, who has faced the Briton 23 times since their first
clash in 2005.
""He's a great guy. We're good friends. We spent so many
times together. On the court, in practice court, we practise tons of times
together. We always had a good relationship.""
Murray fans had been desperate to see their hero make his
Wimbledon farewell.
""He feels like one of our own,"" said 40-year-old
Lorna Kennedy, who had travelled down to London from Dundee in Scotland.
""He's done so well and he's just been so good for the
sport.""
Murray was replaced in the draw on Monday by Belgium's David
Goffin, a lucky loser from qualifying.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/biden-back-on-campaign-trail-as-pressure-mounts-n345398,"Biden back on campaign trail as pressure mounts
Published on: July 07, 2024 11:58 (EAT)

US President Joe Biden was back out on the campaign trail Sunday, desperate to salvage his re-election bid as senior Democrats meet to discuss growing calls that he quit the White House race.
The 81-year-old Democrat took the stage at a predominantly Black church in Philadelphia, part of a two-stop swing in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, before he hosts the NATO leaders' summit in Washington later this week.
He is campaigning under an increasingly unforgiving spotlight, as pressure mounts for him to drop out after his disastrous debate against Donald Trump last month ignited panic over his age and fitness to serve another four years.
Biden has remained defiant, unequivocally declaring he is fit to serve, the only one who can defeat Trump, and staying in the race.
So far, five Democratic lawmakers have called on Biden to drop out, with the drumbeat of dissent slowly rising.
On Sunday, two high-profile congressional Democrats stopped short of calling for Biden to step aside, but warned that he still needed to win over voters worried about his age.
""There's only one reason"" the race between Trump and Biden ""is close, and that's the president's age,"" Representative Adam Schiff told NBC's ""Meet the Press.""
As some speculate about Biden handing off the campaign to Vice President Kamala Harris, Schiff added: ""I think she very well could win overwhelmingly.""
Democratic Senator Chris Murphy meanwhile said ""the president needs to do more,"" including unscripted events like town hall gatherings, to reassure voters he has the mental acuity and physical fitness for a second term.
""This week is going to be absolutely critical,"" Murphy told CNN's Sunday talk show ""State of the Union.""
Those comments came as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has scheduled a virtual meeting of senior Democratic representatives for Sunday to discuss the best way forward, and Democratic Senator Mark Warner is reportedly working to convene a similar forum in the upper chamber.
First Lady Jill Biden, who -- according to some US media reports -- is urging her husband to stay in the race, is scheduled to campaign for him Monday in Georgia, Florida and North Carolina.
But after Sunday's stops in Philadelphia and Harrisburg, the president will have to step away from the trail for the NATO summit beginning Tuesday.
Here, too, he will find himself having to reassure allies at a time when many European countries fear a Trump victory in November.
The 78-year-old Republican has long criticized the transatlantic defense alliance as an unfair burden on the United States, voiced admiration for Russian strongman Vladimir Putin, and insisted he could bring about a quick end to the fighting in Ukraine, where Moscow's invasion is in its third year.
For now, Democratic heavyweights are largely keeping a lid on any simmering discontent with their leader -- at least in public.
But with election day just four months away, any move to replace Biden as the nominee would need to be made sooner rather than later, and the party will be scrutinized for any signs of more open rebellion.
Meanwhile, for Biden and his team, the strategy seems to be to ride it out.
The campaign has unveiled an intense battle plan for July, including an avalanche of TV spots and trips to all the key states.
That includes a visit to the US Southwest during the Republican convention July 15-18, at which Trump is set to be anointed the party's official presidential nominee.
In what had been billed as a make-or-break Friday interview with ABC News, Biden flatly dismissed his falling poll numbers and concerns over his fitness triggered by his dismal June 27 performance against Trump.
But some of his answers were tentative or meandering, even as he deflected questions about his mental acuity and dismissed the notion his party would consider replacing him.
""If the Lord Almighty came down and said, 'Joe, get out of the race,' I'd get out of the race,"" he said.
""But the Lord Almighty is not coming down.""

However, the court has certified the matter as urgent.
“The applicants are, nonetheless, at liberty to seek interim relief once the substantive motion has been filed and served,” reads the court order.
Three days ago, President William Ruto established a 20-member task force to audit resources in the health sector.
However, the petitioners in the matter argue that the taskforce duplicates and usurps the mandate of a statutory body, the Kenya Health Human Resource Advisory Council under section 30 of the Health Act, 2017.
Through lawyer Ochiel Dudley, the petitioners argue that if a cent of public money or a minute of public time is spent by or on the taskforce, their application will be nugatory.
They want the court to stop any payment to the members of the task force and also seek orders restraining any person from convening, aiding, attending, reporting to, receiving reports from, paying, or facilitating the payment of any public funds to the Presidential Taskforce on Addressing Human Resources for Health.
They also want the court to quash Gazette Notice 8437 of 2024 forming the Presidential Taskforce on Addressing Human Resources.

Jan Vertonghen's late own goal took France into the quarter-finals of Euro 2024 on Monday as they edged Belgium 1-0 in a tense tie in Duesseldorf.
France had dominated the last-16 clash but their profligate
finishing looked set to force extra time until they finally found a way through
with five minutes left.
Substitute Randal Kolo Muani collected the ball inside the
Belgian penalty area and hit a shot that was going wide until a deflection off
the unfortunate Vertonghen took it past goalkeeper Koen Casteels.
The lucky break sent the 2022 World Cup runners-up into a
last-eight tie in Hamburg on Friday as they remain on course to become European
champions for the third time.
France are yet to score from open play in four matches at
the tournament -- captain Kylian Mbappe netted once from a penalty against
Poland, while their other two goals came from opposition defenders.
Crucially, however, they are rock solid in defence, having
conceded only one goal, from a penalty, so far.
Their back line was outstanding against Romelu Lukaku and
his fellow attackers, and Belgium bow out after what will go down as a disappointing
tournament for them.
Both of these sides were looking for revenge, in Belgium's
case for their 1-0 defeat against France in the semi-finals of the 2018 World
Cup, a result that still hurts six years on.
France, meanwhile, had a point to prove at the Euros after
going out in the last 16 three years ago on penalties to Switzerland, a deeply
disappointing result in between runs to consecutive World Cup finals.
The French were widely seen as the favourites to win this
tournament before arriving in Germany, but they were below par during the group
phase.
The broken nose suffered by Mbappe in their opening game
against Austria did not help, and the uncertain form of Antoine Griezmann has
been a problem too.
Griezmann was dropped for the last group match against
Poland but returned here in one of two changes, with Marcus Thuram also coming
in as wingers Ousmane Dembele and Bradley Barcola made way.
Meanwhile Belgium coach Domenico Tedesco's reaction to his
own side's unconvincing displays in the group stage was striking.
Yannick Carrasco and Lois Openda were given starts to
provide as much attacking threat as possible in support of Lukaku, while
skipper Kevin De Bruyne played a more withdrawn role.
The hope, for the neutrals at least, was that so much
attacking talent would lead to an open game full of goals, but the reality was
rather different.
Belgium were happy to sit back and thwart France, and did
not test opposition goalkeeper Mike Maignan at all in the first half.
France had lots of the ball, yet often looked untidy,
imprecise and rather flat, with Griezmann appearing lost on the right wing.
But they had chances in the first half, with Thuram heading
just wide from Jules Kounde's inviting cross just after the half-hour mark and
Aurelien Tchouameni twice firing off-target.
Real Madrid midfielder Tchouameni then tested Casteels with
a deflected long-range strike as France upped their game at the beginning of
the second half.
Mbappe accelerated inside and smashed a shot just over, and
there was a sense a goal might be coming.
The breakthrough almost came for Belgium an hour in as
William Saliba lost possession on halfway and De Bruyne released Carrasco, who
was about to pull the trigger when Theo Hernandez arrived to make a brilliant
saving block.
Maignan finally had to make a save 20 minutes from the end
of normal time, to keep out a drive from Lukaku, and was called into action
again to deny De Bruyne.
It was becoming clear that one goal would decide the
contest, and France got it in the 85th minute as N'Golo Kante fed Kolo Muani,
and his shot went in off Vertonghen to take Les Bleus through.

Protestors who survived shooting by the police on Tuesday last week have narrated their ordeals to Citizen TV.
In Nakuru, 25-year-old Ricky Munjaru is among 22 protesters who were shot and injured by police. His life has taken a drastic turn living him with permanent scars.
Munjaru is lucky to be alive after being discharged from the Nakuru referral hospital where he was receiving treatment for gunshot wounds he sustained during the anti-finance bill demonstrations on June 25, 2024.
Speaking to Citizen TV, Munjaru narrated how the peaceful demos turned chaotic and the near death experience that followed.
""I was shot on my back and left leg; the police were shooting indiscriminately,"" he said.
Munjaru participated in the anti-finance bill demonstrations with the intention of urging the government to reduce over-taxation. The experience has however permanently transformed his life.
Ricky, who was shot twice, will now rely on crutches until he fully recovers and can return to his job repairing phones. He believes the scars he carries were incurred for a noble cause.
""I think our President is still not listening to us. He is still making empty promises. Many people have died and have been injured because of the protests. We are not just protesting because we can; we want our country to be perfect,"" said Munjaru.
""We fully support our kids who have taken to the streets. They are fighting for everyone, even the police officers shooting indiscriminately in the streets,"" Julia Busieka, Munjaru's mother, added.
For the families that lost their loved ones in the Anti Finance bill demos in Nakuru, the permanent scars left after their loved ones' passing are painful to bear.
An autopsy conducted on the bodies of 17 year old Austin Onyisa, 24 year old Kevin Madanga and 28 year old Michael Kihuga, three victims who were killed in Nakuru last week has revealed the cause of their deaths as excessive bleeding.
""The cause of death is due to the bullet, what caused excessive bleeding and shock,"" said Dr. Magare Gikenyi, a surgeon in Nakuru.
All eyes are on the government to see whether it will take action on police officers who use excessive force on demonstrators.

The National Police Service (NPS) has
dismissed reports that some of its officers deployed to Haiti on a U.N.-backed peacekeeping mission
have been killed.
This was after claims surfaced online that
seven officers had been killed in the war-torn Caribbean nation as armed gangs mounted
more pressure against the deployed troops.
An image circulated widely over the weekend
showed a recent shot of the Kenyan police patrolling a street in the Haitian
capital Port-au-Prince, with text on it claiming that the Kenyan officers had
been reported dead.
“7 Kenya police reported dead in Haiti aki [President
William Ruto] God will never forgive you,"" read the text.
On Monday morning, NPS however termed the
image as fake.
The police service did not provide further information
about the mission or the state of the Kenyan troops.
The first batch of about 400 Kenyan police officers
arrived in Haiti on June 25.
Kenyan President William Ruto had
ceremonially seen the police off a day earlier in Nairobi, in what he described
as a ""historic"" mission of solidarity.
Hundreds more police are expected from
Kenya and other nations.

According to reports, the two minors, aged two and four, were in their home when their mother, Ms. Susan Muthoni, was preparing lunch for her family when a fire broke out.
Though the cause of the fire was not immediately determined, neighbours reported that it began in one of the houses where the two children were and spread quickly to the other houses.
Roobert Maina and other residents noted that efforts to extinguish the fire in an attempt to save the deceased were futile, and they complained that Nyahururu firefighters took too long to respond to their distress calls.
Angry residents have accused the county firefighter of taking too long to respond, arriving hours after the fire had been extinguished.
They are now requesting that the County government install fire engines within the estate within seven days, citing the fact that fires have been common in the area and that one fire engine is desperately needed.

National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetangula has referred President William Ruto's Memorandum of Referral, in regards to the withdrawal of the controversial Finance Bill 2024/25, to Parliament's Departmental Committee on Finance and Planning for appropriate action.
This comes a day after Ruto submitted the memorandum to Wetangula, officially initiating the process to have the bill withdrawn in its entirety.
""In accordance with Article 115(1)(b) of the Constitution, H.E. the President, vide a Memorandum dated June 26, 2024, referred the Finance Bill 2024 back to the National Assembly for reconsideration with reservations recommending deletion of all clauses of the bill,"" said Wetangula in a statement Thursday.
""The President's Memorandum constitutes a rejection of the bill in its entirety; and that the decision is informed by the need to reflect the voice of the people of Kenya who have rejected the Bill;
Subsequently, Wetangula directed the aforesaid Parliamentary Committee to promptly begin reviewing the President's Memorandum, along with its concerns and recommendations, and submit a report to the House at its next regular session upon reconvening.
""The Committee is required to expeditiously commence consideration of the President's Memorandum, its reservations and recommendation, and report to the House at the next regular sitting upon its resumption.""
""In accordance with Article I I5(4)(a) of the Constitution, any Member desirous of negating the President's reservations or reviving any of the 69 Causes of the Bill is required to marshal the votes of at least two-thirds of the Members of the National Assembly, being 233 Members.""
Wetangula likewise directed the National Assembly's clerk to circulate his message to all MPs and prepare necessary messages for formal conveyance to the House upon Its resumption.
""Standing Order 92(3) provides that a Message received from the President at a time when the House is not in session is to be transmitted to every Member and reported to the House on the day the House next sits,"" said Wetangula.
""The clerk is directed to circulate this notification to all Members of the National Assembly, and accordingly facilitate the Committee to undertake the exercise.""
Ruto verbally withdrew the contentious bill on Wednesday, sparking debates on whether he had the constitutional powers to do so, given that Parliament went on recess earlier in the day and would resume regular sittings on Tuesday, July 23.
According to clause 6 of the Constitution, if the president refuses to sign a bill and fails to return it to Parliament within 14 days, the bill will be considered law, and as such, Ruto had to officially initiate the process by writing to Speaker Wetangula.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/aviation-firm-seeks-compensation-from-bank-after-ksh-92b-reversal-n343750,"Aviation firm seeks compensation from bank after Ksh. 9.2B reversal
Eric Lugalia, Air Afrik Aviation Managing Director told Justice Nixon Sifuna that the bank froze and later reversed the funds, a move that led to the termination of a plane leasing agreement with the government of South Sudan, worth millions of shillings.
In a statement adopted by the court, Lugalia said following the reversal, Air Afrik was unable to execute its obligations under the leasing agreement dated September 4, 2014. The contract was eventually terminated
“I am further aware that the Plaintiff (Air Afrik) spent substantial time, resources and also incurred substantial loss and damages in pursuit of the illegal freezing of its account but the 1st Defendant (Stanbic) adamantly refused to unfreeze or allow the Plaintiff to access the said credit balance,” Lugalia said in the sworn statement.
Air Afrik sued Stanbic in 2018 over alleged breach of banking regulations after crediting $7.2 million into its accounts before the funds were frozen and later reversed, without a valid court order or a directive from the Central Bank of Kenya.
The airline is seeking to be paid damages for losses suffered after a plane leasing contract of $20 million with South Sudan government was terminated after the funds were withheld.
According to the airline, the money had been deposited for a plane-leasing contract it signed with the Ministry of Defence and Veteran Affairs of South Sudan in September 2014.
Under the agreement, Juba was required to pay Air Afrik a deposit of 35 per cent ($7.2 million) of the value of total contract sum estimated at $20.64 million.
“I believe that since the Payment Order pursuant to which the 1st Defendant paid to the Plaintiff the sum of USD.7,224,000.00 was in the form of a Credit Advice, the same connoted an electronic transfer from one of the 1st Defendant’s customers (1 st Defendant and/or GOSS) to another one of the 1st Defendant’s customers (the Plaintiff),” Lugalia said.
He added that there was therefore no requirement of actual funds changing hands as the bank claims.
In its defence, Stanbic has stated that the transaction was reversed after realising that the credit note from South Sudan government did not have funds and the lender could not use its own money.
The bank maintained it was forced to reverse the entry that it had made to the customer’s account since it was made in error and not backed by the actual transfer of funds.
Stanbic said there was no obligation, contractual or otherwise, requiring it to pay its own funds to settle a debt owed to the airline by a third party.
The lender says that on February 5, 2016, it received a Credit Advice Note from the Bank of South Sudan advising that its account at BSS had been credited on account of Air Afrik for payment from the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning, for the contract.
On February 8, 2016 the bank says it credited the airline’s account with the same amount and debited it with the applicable commissions. It froze the money and reversed it a few days later.
Air Afrik is seeking for Sh80million compensation as damages.
The hearing continues.

Sofapaka head coach Ezekiel Akwana is confident his team will get the better of Naivas FC and retain their Kenyan Premier League status.
The Batoto Ba Mungu had
a horrible run in the ended 2023/24 Kenyan Premier League campaign finishing at
position 16 to head to the playoffs against Naivas.
And having secured a first leg advantage, a 1-0 win over
Naivas at the weekend, Akwana is bullish of fending off the challenge to retain
a core-status in the top division
Jacob Onyango was the hero for Akwana’s men scoring the lone
goal at the Police Sacco Stadium to secure the first-leg advantage.
“I can say we are
already in the KPL, because I had planned to get a draw in the first leg but I won,
so I am planning for a draw in the second match to finish the job,” said
Akwana.
Jacob Onyango came on in the second half for the injured
Darius Msagha and made a difference in a game that was seemingly headed for a
draw.
He stepped up in the 89th minute to strike the ball into the
back of the net to give his side a first leg advantage, and his coach, though
satisfied with the score, is still conscious heading to the return match.
“We cannot say that it’s done and dusted 100% because we
still have another 90 minutes to play. Concerning Jacob, he did not play fully
well though he scored. There are things I expected of him that he did not do.
However we played well in the first half without him and in the second he came
in, got his moment and he utilized it.”

England escaped an embarrassing last-16 exit at Euro 2024 thanks to Jude Bellingham's overhead kick before Harry Kane struck in extra-time to grab a 2-1 win over Slovakia on Sunday.
The Three Lions have been hyped as one of the favourites as they bid to end a 58-year wait for major tournament glory but looked set to go out with a whimper to Ivan Schranz's 25th minute goal.
However, Bellingham's moment of inspiration five minutes into six added on in stoppage time breathed new life into Gareth Southgate's reign as England boss.
Kane then headed in just a minute into extra-time to set up a quarter-final meeting with Switzerland on Saturday.
""That's the desire and the attitude from the boys. It looked tough for a second there but you keep going,"" said Kane. ""Jude does what Jude does and what an unbelievable goal.""
Southgate looked set to fall on his sword after steadfastly refusing to make changes to a side that stumbled through as winners of Group C despite scoring just two goals in three games.
Kobbie Mainoo was introduced for his first competitive start in Southgate's only change and he paid the price with another lacklustre display lacking in any speed or invention for long spells.
""We want to be better,"" said Southgate. ""I'm not going to hide from that but the spirit and character was there for everybody to see and we're still in there fighting.""
The one saving grace of England's performances in the group stage was that a makeshift defence had held up well, conceding just once in three games.
However, they were torn to pieces early on by a Slovakia side ranked 45th in the world.
England did not heed a couple of warnings as David Hancko and Lukas Haraslin were wasteful with big chances.
Slovakia finally punished their more illustrious opponents when David Strelec was given acres of room to turn and play in Schranz, who confidently stroked past Jordan Pickford for his third goal of the tournament.
The half-time whistle was met with a chorus of boos but Southgate still stuck to his guns and did not make a change until 25 minutes to go.
England did at least improve on a dismal first half and had the ball in the net within five minutes of the restart.
Phil Foden turned in Kieran Trippier's cross but was caught offside after a VAR review.
Slovakia should have doubled their lead shortly afterwards when England gave away possession and Strelec saw Pickford well off his line but failed to hit the target from the halfway line.
Southgate's hand was finally forced on 66 minutes by an injury to Trippier.
But England still struggled to create and looked down and out when Kane headed wide a golden opportunity and Declan Rice smashed the post with a long-range pot shot.
Southgate was even derided by the England support for bringing on Ivan Toney deep into stoppage time with chants of ""you don't know what you're doing.""
However, there was an incredible twist as Bellingham acrobatically turned home Guehi's flick-on from a throw-in the final moments of added-on time.
""It's a feeling that is like no other,"" said Bellingham.
""You're 30 seconds from going home and having to listen to all the rubbish and feeling like you've let a nation of people down. In 30 seconds or one kick of the ball everything can change.""
Slovakia were suddenly rattled and Toney was to have a telling contribution.
The Brentford striker headed Eberechi Eze's mishit shot back across goal for Kane to power home his second goal of the tournament.
Slovakia should still have taken the game to penalties when full-back Peter Pekarik failed to turn in a dangerous driven cross from point-blank range.
But England live to fight another day come the quarter-final against an impressive Switzerland, who comfortably knocked out holders Italy 2-0 on Saturday.

https://www.citizen.digital/tech/the-intelligence-era-experts-explain-the-impact-of-cloud-connectivity-in-ai-revolution-n345056,"The Intelligence Era: Experts explain the impact of Cloud, Connectivity in AI revolution
The growth witnessed in generative AI has caused major disruptions in various industries, prompting more efforts to harness the power of the technology, while mitigating risks involved.
Shaun Collins, the Chairman of CCS Insight, and Brian Chamberlain, the Executive Advisor with Carrier Marketing, Huawei, explain that AI is now playing an enormous part in the thinking and planning of what’s coming next.
“I think it is fair to say when we asked the enterprises and employees and consumers what they think are going to make the biggest impacts difference in their businesses and individual lives, almost everybody said it is AI. But as to the why and how, it is much more difficult to say,” Shaun said during the Mobile World Congress (MWC) held in Shanghai, China.
Brian notes that AI is being used in a way much broader than expected, and it is now important to think about where it is going and who has access to it.
According to Shaun, AI is a complimentary technology, which will make other operations and workflows better.
He adds that AI also has the capability to enhance 5G Network, to see its adoption as a standalone technology.
On his part, Brian describes AI as an equaliser to both developed and developing nations, as it presents equal opportunities.
“AI is levelling out the playing field in the developing world. One of the surprising experience is that we heard some amazing applications from Algeria, from Zimbabwe … coming from the emerging world, because they were looking at the problems from a very different angle from people in the advanced countries. That has helped me realise that AI, Cloud and connectivity will level out the world in a way we’ve never seen before and that you don’t have to be living in the most advanced economy to be able to have the most advanced and exciting jobs,” notes Brian.
The technology expert adds that connectivity will enable people to reach a global market and take advantage of the most advanced technology.
The Infrastructure puzzle
In developing countries, lack of infrastructure is termed as a major barrier to connectivity and adoption of digital technologies.
The fast-paced development in AI raises concerns about whether the underprivileged markets will miss out on the full benefits of technology due to a lack of infrastructure to access digital services.
Today, a number of African countries lack advanced digital infrastructure and enablers such as power and connectivity. This poses as a threat to AI adoption in such areas.
According to Shaun and Brian, the infrastructure barriers in underdeveloped nations will not fully block them from the AI experience.
They say that even though deploying 5G-A network is a challenge for now, AI will work on 4G as it is already being deployed in mid-tier devices.
“The unified standard is only here with 4G. The benefits of it is extraordinary. We are going to lose it if we don’t protect it,” says Brian.
The experts also present cloud technology as a key enabler of AI.
“It is not just 5G. It is connectivity. It is essential to be connected all the time. It is the combination of these technologies, not just the connection, but the connection plus those services, delivered by the Cloud, and powered by AI, that is going to create incredible things going forward.”
The user matrix in Mobile AI era
In the Intelligence Era, users are now at the centre of major developments. Most users interact with digital technologies using mobile phones.
This has led the industry to develop more AI features in mobile devices.
Shaun and Brian also note that users are already changing the matrix of search, where they are parting with search engines and opting for AI assistants.
The advancements in search therefore present a change in prompting for AI assistants.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/irans-presidential-election-hardliner-jalili-and-moderate-pezeshkian-face-voter-apathy-n345075,"Iran's presidential election: Hardliner Jalili and moderate Pezeshkian face voter apathy
The zealous anti-Westerner and the low-key moderate hoping to become Iran's next president could struggle to mobilise millions of supporters in Friday's run-off election amid voter apathy about a tightly-controlled contest.
Over 60% of voters abstained from the June 28 ballot for a successor to Ebrahim Raisi following his death in a helicopter crash, a historic low turnout which critics of the government see as a vote of no confidence in the Islamic Republic.
Friday's vote will be a tight race between lawmaker Massoud Pezeshkian, the sole moderate in the original field of four candidates, and former Revolutionary Guards member Saeed Jalili.
Both candidates have sought to engage voters by offering competing visions, with Jalili offering hawkish foreign and domestic policies and Pezeshkian advocating more social and political freedoms. Both pledge to revive the economy, plagued by mismanagement, state corruption, and sanctions reimposed since 2018 over Iran's nuclear programme.
The clerical establishment needs a high turnout for its own credibility, particularly as it faces regional tension over the war between Israel and Iranian ally Hamas in Gaza, and increased Western pressure over its fast-advancing nuclear programme.
But growing numbers of Iranians have abstained at elections in recent years. The previous record low turnout was 41% in a parliamentary election in March, while Raisi won in 2021 on a turnout of about 49%, in which authorities disqualified heavy-weight conservative and moderate rivals.
""The run-off is a clash of visions: Jalili's hardline ideology versus Pezeshkian's call for essential moderation and change,"" said Ali Vaez of International Crisis Group.
""Beyond opposing Jalili, Pezeshkian must compete with voter apathy and secure at least some votes from this critical silent majority to win the election.""
The next president is not expected to usher in any major policy shift on Iran's nuclear programme or support for militia groups across the Middle East, since Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei calls all the shots on top state matters.
However, the president can influence the tone of Iran's domestic and foreign policy.
With Khamenei aged 85, the next president will be closely involved in selecting the next supreme leader. Insiders say Khamenei is keen on a loyal and compliant president who can ensure a smooth eventual succession to his successor.
The rivals are establishment men loyal to Iran's theocratic rule, but analysts said Jalili's win would signal a potentially even more antagonistic domestic and foreign policy.
Pezeshkian's triumph at the polls might promote a pragmatic foreign policy, ease tensions over now-stalled negotiations with major powers to revive the nuclear pact, and improve the prospects for social liberalisation and political pluralism.
To take victory from his hardline rival, Pezeshkian also needs to attract votes from supporters of hardline parliament speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, who finished third in the first round, while mobilising a mostly young population chafing at political and social restrictions to vote for him again.
""Given Jalili's extremism, I think it's entirely possible more moderate conservative voters who cast their vote for Qalibaf will either vote for Pezeshkian or stay home next Friday,"" said Eurasia group analyst Gregory Brew.
Backed by the reformist faction that has largely been sidelined in Iran in recent years, Pezeshkian's campaign has been largely focused on ""fear of the worse"".
""I will vote this time ... because Jalili's presidency means more restrictions ... This is choosing between bad and worse,"" said Mehrshad, 34, a teacher in Tehran.
With no intention of confronting the powerful security hawks and clerical rulers, analysts said, Pezeshkian is not expected to gain support from many reform-minded Iranians, who have largely stayed away from the polls for the last four years.
""Pezeshkian is part of the establishment. He will follow Khamenei's orders ... Let the world know that Iranians do not want the Islamic Republic, I will not vote,"" said university student Farzaneh in the central city of Yazd.
Activists and opposition groups have called for a boycott distributing the hashtag #ElectionCircus on social media platform X.

Colombia coach Nestor Lorenzo said his team had been rewarded for their bravery in their 1-0 win over Uruguay in Wednesday's incident-packed Copa America semi-final.
Down to 10 men for the entire second half, after Daniel Munoz was sent off just before the interval, Colombia held on for victory without the need for ultra-defensive tactics.
""The truth is that it was a very tough match. Uruguay is an excellent team, with excellent players and a coach I admire a lot"" Lorenzo said of his fellow Argentine, counterpart Marcelo Bielsa.
""But we took the lead, the risk, and we were even brave. When we were down one we kept two strikers and that is an act of courage that was rewarded,"" said Lorenzo.
Munoz was dismissed after a wild elbow on Manuel Ugarte earned him a second yellow but Lorenzo had no harsh words for his player.
""Dani is a little more down because he is a lion and he was betrayed by emotion. I gave him a hug and told him: without you we wouldn't be here,"" he said.
""(But) one of the issues we always talk about is not to be left with one less man,"" added Lorenzo.
The win means Colombia will face Argentina in Sunday's final in Miami and Lorenzo said he was relishing the match-up with his homeland team.
""This is going to be very nice, I am going to be (competing) with players I met during my career and who I admire a lot,"" said the former Argentina assistant coach.
""We have to recover and arrive in the best way. We hope we don't have any news from the medical team, because there are always blows, pain that has to be treated, but I think we are going to arrive in good shape,"" he said.
The win also extends Colombia's unbeaten run to 28 games, 25 of them under Lorenzo's guidance, and it breaks the previous record of 27 matches set between 1992 and 1994 when the likes of Carlos Valderrama and Freddy Rincon graced the side.
""As we said we would, we went game by game. We did not surpass (the 90's team) They left a base. So it is not leaving that behind, it is adding to it, so that Colombian football grows"".
""But this is a group that wants to be a protagonist, that wants to win something, that is hungry and that is in growing. We are moving forward,"" he added.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/nato-picks-netherlands-mark-rutte-as-next-boss-n344750,"NATO picks Netherlands' Mark Rutte as next boss
Rutte's appointment became a formality after his only rival for the post, Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, announced last week that he had quit the race, having failed to gain traction.
""The North Atlantic Council decided to appoint Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte as the next Secretary General of NATO, succeeding Jens Stoltenberg,"" NATO said in a statement.
""Mr Rutte will assume his functions as Secretary General from 1 October 2024, when Mr Stoltenberg’s term expires after ten years at the helm of the Alliance,"" it added.
After declaring his interest in the post last year, Rutte gained early support from key members of the alliance including the United States, Britain, France and Germany.
Others were more reticent, particularly Eastern European countries which argued the post should go to someone from their region for the first time.
But they ultimately rowed in behind Rutte, a fierce critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin and a staunch ally of Ukraine.
Stoltenberg said he warmly welcomed the selection of Rutte as his successor.
""Mark is a true transatlanticist, a strong leader, and a consensus-builder,"" he said. ""I know I am leaving NATO in good hands.""
NATO takes decisions by consensus so Rutte, who is bowing out of Dutch politics after nearly 14 years as prime minister, could only be confirmed once all 32 alliance members gave him their backing.
Rutte will face the challenge of sustaining allies' support for Ukraine's fight against Russia's invasion while guarding against NATO's being drawn directly into a war with Moscow.
He will also have to contend with the possibility that NATO-skeptic Donald Trump may return to the White House after November's U.S. presidential election.
Trump's possible return has unnerved NATO leaders as the Republican former president called into question U.S. willingness to support other members of the alliance if they were attacked.

Extreme Sports Chief Executive Officer, Hussein Mohamed has
blamed lack of vision, plan and poor marketing strategy by the Kenya's football governing body FKF for the country’s perennial underperformance.
Mohamed says this problem has
led to Kenya`s top tier league not attracting investors whose involvement is
critical to their sustainability.
He says for Kenya to
successfully develop football as a business sector the federation needs to win
the confidence of the development partners, corporates, national and county
governments adding that their involvement would help in growing football in the
country.
Speaking to Citizen Digital in
Murang'a County after the conclusion of 2023/24 FKF-Premier season, Mohammed opined
that football can be source of employment for the younger generation if it can
be commercialized and handled professionally.
""World over, football is a
multi-billion-dollar industry that has created employment for the talented but
in Kenya teams are struggling due to lack of vision and plan by the federation,""
he said.
Hussein wondered why local
league winners are still not getting prize money from the federation, his
sentiments coming barely a day after Gor Mahia were crowned FKF-PL champions
but only received a trophy on Sunday by FKF President Nick Mwendwa.
""I don’t understand how the
League champions in Kenya don’t attract even Ksh. 50million as prize money.
“It’s very shameful that in our
league teams run a whole season with nothing to show for it."" Hussein
wondered.
He posits that proper management
structures will attract sponsors from both public and private sectors, making
the league formidable.
""We can pull so much
resources, if we put our house in order, a big number of team in the FKF-Premier
League can’t sustain themselves because they are playing a League that has
nothing to offer to them in terms of money,"" he stated.
He added, ""Its eight years
since Nick Mwendwa took office and teams are struggling starting from the top
tier league down to NSL, Division One and Division Two.""
""I have interacted with majority
of the teams in lower leagues and they don’t want to be promoted to higher
leagues because they can't afford to participate in it, because they are using
much to honor matches but they get nothing in return,"" he revealed.
Regarding the upcoming football
national elections, the Extreme Sports Chief Executive Officer has called on
the stakeholders to make a right decision that will define the future and
growth of football in the country.
""We have had enough over the time, this is the time to reflect on how important it is to have the right people in right places who can take us to the next level and grow this (football) industry,"" he stated.
""Poor leadership has made
people who love the sport turn into beggars and this must change by having the
right people taking over the administration of this sport (football),"" he
underscored.

“Six young people yesterday lost their lives, which is very unfortunate; they shouldn’t have lost their lives. I wish that would not have happened,” he said.
Human rights organizations and other International bodies had however released conflicting figures with the Kenya Human Rights Commission (KHRC) disclosing that 23 people were fatally shot during the protests and more than 300 people were injured.
KHRC also noted that most of the killings occurred on Tuesday night, pointing out that officers opened fire at protesters in Githurai.
“As of yesterday evening, the Police Reforms Working Group (PRWG) recorded 23 deaths caused by police shootings nationwide. There were over 50 arrests, 22 abductions and over 300 injuries. Reports reaching us also indicate that police opened fire and killed several people in Githurai, Nairobi, last night,” KHRC stated on Wednesday.
According to a report by Amnesty International on Tuesday, 13 people were shot with live bullets, four with rubber bullets and 3 sustained injuries after being hit with teargas canisters.
As a result, over 31 people were injured and five people were shot dead on Tuesday.
In his speech, the president also denied recently reported cases of abductions, reiterating that his administration was still committed to ensuring that there were no extra-judicial killings in the country.
He allayed concerns of incommunicado arrests saying that anyone arrested during protests was detained at police stations, adding that those who died would be accounted for.
“There is a framework to make sure those people who died yesterday there will be accounted for,” he said.
“I did promise the country that there will be no extra-judicial killing going forward; and ever since I came into office, there is not one incident of extra-judicial killing…What you said about abductions are statements attributed to our civil society groups. But all the people they mentioned have since been found in police custody and those that were already processed were already released.”

Published on: June 30, 2024 02:14 (EAT)

Belgium have a chance for revenge on Monday when they face neighbours France in the last 16 of Euro 2024, a showdown between two big-hitters who have played well below expectations so far.
Defeat to France in the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup was extremely bitter for Belgium, as a so-called ""golden generation"" of players was sucker-punched by Les Bleus after a stunning last-eight victory over Brazil.
That loss became even more painful over time as Belgium's performances at major tournaments got progressively worse despite being able to call upon an unprecedented pool of talent.
And frustration boiled over in the stands in Stuttgart on Wednesday even though their goalless draw with Ukraine pushed Belgium into the knockout stage.
Belgium would have avoided France and in fact been on the other, ostensibly easier, side of the draw had they beaten Ukraine and finished top of Group E.
Instead the Red Devils had to settle for a point which infuriated their supporters, who unleashed a volley of boos and whistles at their underwhelming team.
Fans were particularly angered by the safety-first approach adopted by Domenico Tedesco's team in the final minutes of the game, sitting back while wary of a late Ukraine goal which would have knocked them out.
The fury was such that star midfielder Kevin De Bruyne appeared to instruct his team-mates not to head over to applaud supporters after the game, later saying little more than ""we need them against France"".
Tedesco said that he was ""a little bit surprised"" by the level of fan anger as his team had qualified from the tournament's tightest group, improving on their dismal, and at times comical, showing at the last World Cup in Qatar.
And Belgium would likely have topped the group but for Romelu Lukaku's horrendous luck, with the striker looking sharp but having three goals chalked off by VAR decisions.
Two came in their opening 1-0 defeat to Slovakia and the last, in Belgium's 2-0 victory over group winners Romania, caused fans to loudly curse their poor fortune when Lukaku's big toe was shown to be offside.
Lukaku might not have got off the mark but he did set up Youri Tielemans for one of Belgium's two goals and is in far better form than when he flopped at the last World Cup in Qatar after rushing back from injury.
""I think we had a lot of chances. For me we don't really need to change anything, just be more sharp,"" Johan Bakayoko told reporters on Saturday.
""And yeah, we need to have a bit more luck which is also a part of football. Sometimes we score four or five times and sometimes we don't.""
PSV Eindhoven winger Bakayoko, 21, was still playing youth football for Mechelen when France beat Belgium at the World Cup six years ago and says the current team aren't thinking about that elimination ahead of Monday's match in Duesseldorf.
""Everything is different, so the game can be different and I don't think it's the same case as the past because we have different players, different styles. The way we see football is different, so yeah, it will be a different game,"" he added.
""In general they're very good in every position, they have class players in every position and we do also.""
Belgium will play one of Portugal or Slovenia in the quarter-finals should they get past France.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/knut-urges-government-to-address-gen-z-protests-amidst-academic-disruptions-n345041,"KNUT urges government to address Gen Z protests amidst academic disruptions
The Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT), Kisumu branch, has petitioned the government to expedite addressing the demands of Generation Z to end the protests and restore normalcy as schools have resumed amidst heavy demonstrations led by youthful Kenyans, the Gen Zs.
Addressing the press, David Obuon, the Executive Secretary of the KNUT Kisumu branch, stated that most schools in urban areas rely on public transport, and with the ongoing protests, learners were stranded.
""With the disruption in public transport, accessing schools will be a challenge for learners,"" said Obuon.
""Last week, a school in Kisumu was tear-gassed, causing learners and teachers to flee for safety. Many learners suffered, and we are uncertain about their security,"" he reiterated.
The Union also urged the government to release capitation funds to schools on time to facilitate smooth operations.
""Sports activities and music festivals are ongoing, and without funding, it becomes a challenge,"" Obuon added.
""The government promised to build classrooms and facilities for grade 9, due in a few months. However, as of now, we are unsure which schools have received the funds,"" he reiterated.
Regarding Junior Secondary School (JSS) teachers, Mr Obuon called on the government to uphold its initial stance and the court’s decision to confirm intern teaching staff on permanent and pensionable terms.
The Union asked the government not to treat teachers as casualties of the suspended Controversial Finance Bill 2024, which President Ruto said would affect the employment of JSS teachers. Obuon emphasized that teachers are the nation's hope and should be motivated to inspire learners.
""If teachers are paid well, they will be motivated to deliver and impart knowledge to learners,"" he said.
""Furthermore, those due for promotion should be promoted, and delayed salaries should be paid,"" he reiterated.
The Union expressed displeasure with the current government's handling of the Ministry of Education through the Cabinet Secretary and Members of Parliament.
""We have seen members of parliament from certain regions distributing employment letters at funerals, and teachers kneeling to receive them. This shows that something is wrong with the leadership,"" Obuon revealed.
He urged the Cabinet Secretary for Education, Ezekiel Machogu, to improve his ministry management.

Retiring Germany veteran Toni Kroos said he was confident Friday's
blockbuster Euro 2024 quarter-final against Spain would not be the last game of
his career.
Kroos announced in May he would hang up his boots after the Euros
on home soil, meaning this week's match in Stuttgart could be his final game.
Real Madrid teammate Joselu said this week he wanted to ""send
Kroos into retirement"" but the 34-year-old midfielder had his sights set
on the July 14 Euros final in Berlin.
""We will still be in the tournament for a while,"" Kroos
told reporters on Wednesday at Germany's base camp in the Bavarian village of
Herzogenaurach.
""I don't think tomorrow will be my last game. I think we'll
see each other again -- and I look forward to it,"" he added.
The 2014 World Cup winner stepped down from the national team in
2021 but agreed to return in March.
""The idea of returning was tied to the goal of winning the
Euros,"" Kroos said.
""If I didn't see the chance of achieving it with the team, I
wouldn't have done it.""
Kroos said he ""did not fear"" life after football,
saying ""this day will come for every player.""
""Thank god I could make the decision myself, rather than
anyone pushing me or making me feel that it might be better to do it earlier.
""I am aware that whatever comes along, or what hobbies I
might try and take up, there will never be anything I am as good at as playing
football.""
The six-time Champions League winner made his debut for Bayern
Munich in 2007, the same year 16-year-old Spain winger Lamine Yamal was born.
""That
doesn't make me feel much younger,"" Kroos said, calling Yamal ""the
best or at least the most dangerous player"" for club side Barcelona this
season.

Kenya’s U23 national football team, Emerging
Stars’ journey at the 2024 COSAFA Cup came to an end, despite finishing second in Group B.
Kenya finished with six
points, same as leaders Comoros who had a superior goal difference, and were
banking on Angola and Namibia drawing or losing their respective last Group C matches
to sneak to the semis.
Namibia advanced to the semi-finals slated for Friday, July 5, 2024, as the best runner-up across all the three groups, dislodging Kenya (six points, Group B) and South Africa (five points, Group A).
But a consolation goal three minutes from the end by Seychelles’ Brandon Labrosse changed the complexion of the pool and dropped Namibia from first place on goal-difference to second on goals scored.
Lehlohonolo Fothoane gave Lesotho the lead on 26 minutes, but when Depu slotted a penalty just before halftime, he levelled the game and moved to the top of the 2024 COSAFA Cup scorers charts alongside Namibia’s Bethuel Muzeu with a third goal in the competition.
Vidinho then netted a second for the Angolans on 63 minutes to ensure they would advance to the knockout rounds, before Miro added a second penalty late on to net his side’s third goal.
In the semis, Comoros will take on Angola in the first game at 15h00 CAT, before Mozambique do battle with Namibia in the second game at 18h00 CAT. Both matches will be played at the iconic Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium.
Entrance will be FREE with tickets for available at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium ticket office on a first come, first served basis.

https://www.citizen.digital/news/kenyans-unleash-their-anger-on-popular-x-personality-osama-otero-for-hosting-president-ruto-on-space-n345288,"Kenyans unleash their anger on popular X personality Osama Otero for hosting President Ruto on Space
Otero, who has been one of the most diehard anti-Ruto voices on X, and who also was abducted and later released at the height of the Finance Bill demonstrations, on Friday, July 5 hosted a Space intended to parallel the President's own Space, even after promising his followers and Kenyans in general that he would sabotage the Head of State's X convention.
However, things took a rather drastic turn soon after Ruto's Space had kicked off, with Otero quickly admitting the President - and State House spokesperson Hussein Mohammed - into his own Space and even allowing them to address members.
This move, coming from someone who had recently sustained almost unparalleled opposition against the Kenyan government, caught many unawares, with thousands of his followers shocked at his sudden about-turn especially after he had promised to counter Ruto's own Space alongside his colleagues.
On the same day President Ruto would be hosting his Space, Otero was to also host a parallel Space alongside fellow X personality Kimuzi. The move had been welcomed by thousands of Kenyans, with many looking forward to the showdown ahead.
Otero himself had cautioned people against joining the President's Space, offering an alternative and repeatedly inviting everyone to the President's big humiliation.
""Believe me not that President Ruto space plus his cabinet will cost not less than 50 million. Kila CS atasema alispend 1million on a good laptop microphone and data..."" Otero tweeted.
And to further demonstrate his opposition to the Ruto Space, Otero asked, ""Jamaa anatuletea goons offline then anataka kutuletea goons online?""
On the material day, however, tweeps were caught flat-footed with Otero appearing to be co-hosting the same space with individuals he had spent the better part of last month tirelessly fighting - even getting abducted and tortured.
Otero's planned co-hosting Kimuzi was one of the most disappointed Kenyans, tweeting, ""Otero alikua anajua Beasely Kamau on a personal level. Leo Beasely Kamau is being buried. Otero alipost akishow wasee they attend his burial today kirende. Alafu anahost William Ruto. The guy who ended Beasely Kamau's life through police. Hamjajam enough? Right?""
Hanifa Adan, too, did not hide her anger at Otero. Tweeting out a fireball of expletives aimed at him, she finished off,"" Shameless bastard! ""
T. R Okuna, yet another X personality also expressed his dismay, saying, ""I am not as disappointed with the sellouts. They are weak: it's the scoundrel's constitution. What I am disappointed about is that they will come back, after dancing on your graves & you will still give them an ear. And laugh with them, & they know it, & they are counting on it.""
Things got even spicier after it appeared that even Jamia Mosque was sending subliminal attacks.
They simply tweeted: “…and that Allāh does not guide the plan of betrayers.” (Quran 12:52).""
On Otero's Space, the President got to say a few words before technical issues threw things off balance, again.
“I want to apologise for the last hour we have not had a proper connection due to technology. I apologise,” he said.
While addressing an issue that he was out of touch with reality, Ruto defended himself that he only acts on information that is credible from the relevant authorities.
“I have the benefit of more information in my hands. What I cannot do is operate on numbers that have no basis. I said 25 Kenyans died out of protests. Some reckless people have put the numbers all the way to 100. Others said there was a massacre in Githurai, that was not true,” Ruto said.

https://nation.africa/kenya/news/president-ruto-sacks-entire-cabinet-4687068,"President William Ruto has sacked all cabinet secretaries and Attorney General Justin Muturi in response to youth-led anti-government protests.
Only Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi, who is also Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary, was spared.
""Upon reflection, listening keenly to what the people of Kenya have said and after a holistic appraisal of the performance of my Cabinet and its achievements and challenges, I have, in line with the powers given to me by Article 152(1) and 152(5)(b) of the Constitution and Section 12 of the Office of the Attorney-General Act, decided to dismiss with immediate effect all the Cabinet Secretaries and the Attorney-General from the Cabinet of the Republic of Kenya except the Prime Cabinet Secretary and Cabinet Secretary for Foreign and Diaspora Affairs,"" said President Ruto in televised announced.
Dr Ruto said he would involve other political stakeholders in the process of reconstituting his Cabinet.
In the meantime, the President said, government operations will continue under the leadership of Principal Secretaries and other relevant officials.
""I will immediately engage in extensive consultations across different sectors and political formations, with the aim of setting up a broad-based government that will assist me in accelerating and expediting the necessary, urgent and irreversible, implementation of radical programmes to deal with the burden of debt, raising domestic resources, expanding job opportunities, eliminate wastage and unnecessary duplication of a multiplicity of government agencies and slay the dragon of corruption consequently making the government lean, inexpensive, effective and efficient,"" he added.
Dr Ruto on Tuesday announced plans for a ""broad-based political arrangement"", giving credence to the notion that he may be considering co-opting Raila Odinga's Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) into his beleaguered Kenya Kwanza administration.
The Nation has learnt that the president is toying with the possibility of a ""government of national unity"" with opposition figures in his administration as part of his way out of the current political crisis triggered by protesting youths who have cornered him and demanded a major shake-up of his government.
It would not be the first time that Kenya has had a government of national unity.
When the late President Mwai Kibaki lost the 2005 referendum to the No camp led by his then Roads minister Raila Odinga, he responded by sacking his entire cabinet.
When he reconstituted it two weeks later, Mr Odinga and his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) members were left out.
""Following the results of the referendum, it has become necessary for me, as President of the Republic, to reorganise my government to make it more cohesive and better able to serve the people of Kenya,"" Mr Kibaki said.
“I have directed that the Offices of all Ministers and all Assistant Ministers become vacant. Consequently, the occupants of the said offices cease to hold their respective offices with immediate effect,” he said.",2024-07-11
https://nation.africa/kenya/counties/muranga/five-killed-in-thursday-murang-a-accident-4687000,"Five people died in Murang'a County on Thursday lunchtime after a private car collided with a trailer on the Kenol-Murang'a road.
Two others - a man and a woman - were rushed to hospital with serious injuries, said Murang'a South Deputy County Commissioner Gitonga Murungi.
""At about noon, we were unfortunately struck by a serious tragedy that left five men dead on the spot and two others seriously injured,"" he said.
The deaths brought the total number of people killed in accidents on the same route to 14 in less than a week.
Mr Murungi said the private car had seven passengers and was travelling from Murang'a towards Kenol.
""At a place called Kagurumo stage, the car hit a trailer that was heading towards Murang'a and was involved in a head-on collision that left this devastation,"" he said.
Mr Murungi said the dead were taken to Murang'a County mortuary while the vehicles involved in the accident were towed to Maragua police station.
""We have now started a situation analysis to understand exactly what went wrong. We are also in the process of identifying the victims,"" he said.
The accident comes barely a week after nine others died on the same route in 12 hours.
Four youths died instantly
The first accident occurred on Sunday morning in Kabati Township, where four youths died instantly after their car was hit from behind.
Murang'a County Police Commander Mathiu Kainga told the Nation that the accident involved three vehicles travelling from Kenol town to Nairobi.
""The youths were travelling in a small car and we have established that they were members of the African Independent Pentecostal Churches of Africa (AIPCA) returning from a mission in Meru County,"" he said.
The AIPCA's presiding archbishop in Kenya, Samson Muthuri, said in a statement that the dead were members of Makongeni church in Thika West sub-county.
Less than 12 hours later, four more people died in another four-vehicle accident a few kilometres from the scene.
Kiambu County police commander Michael Muchiri said the four died in Ndarugo area in Juja sub-county.
""Two cars were first hit by a trailer and as rescue efforts were in full swing, a school van sped into the scene and rammed into them, killing three people on the spot,"" he said.
Mr Muchiri said the driver of the van was also killed.
Mr Muchiri said the motorcyclist from the nearby Del Monte pineapple processor, who was on normal patrol against a gang stealing produce from the company, was crushed to death by a trailer.
""We have since identified the man as Gideon Maluki, who was killed in the line of duty on Monday morning. The accident occurred at the British American Tobacco stage near Makongeni,"" he said.",2024-07-11
https://nation.africa/kenya/counties/siaya/change-how-you-deal-with-gen-z-or-perish-orengo-warns-politicians-4687042,"Siaya Governor James Orengo has fired a warning shot at the political class, insisting that they must change their tact in dealing with the current youth impasse in the country.
Describing the recent protests by youths as a call for good governance, he said it was a wake-up call to the political class.
Orengo warned that failure by politicians or political parties to heed the youth's demands could lead to an uncontrolled situation.
He told President William Ruto that the Gen Zs were not the ""ordinary politicians"".
Quoting former Tanzanian President Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, Orengo, who has been at the forefront of constitutional reforms for most of his political life, said all the youth wanted was change and they were ready to have it with or without the support of the political class.
""Nyerere once advised the CCM party, and I'm paraphrasing, '(Kenyans) are looking for change and if they don't get change through the political parties, they will look for it without and outside the political parties and push their agenda outside the normal structures',"" Governor Orengo said.
His sentiments came at a time when the political class, led by President Ruto and Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party leader Raila Odinga is facing a backlash over the proposed multi-sectoral national dialogue aimed at addressing issues raised by the youths.
Governor Orengo believes that the current Kenya Kwanza government is dysfunctional and should not remain in power.
“What the demonstrations by the youth showed was that in full consciousness, it is difficult to do business with a government that is not serving your interest. The Kenya Kwanza government constitutes an existential threat to the well-being of Kenyans and that is what has cost it its legitimacy,” said Governor Orengo.
He told Nation.Africa that there was no way in the history of Kenya, even during the colonial era, that protesters would have managed to break into Parliament and other key government buildings as happened a few weeks ago.
The Siaya County boss, and a close ally of Odinga, said the current call by the youth and Kenyans in general is not for reform but for revolution because they feel they are not being listened to.
“The language Kenyans are now talking about is a revolution because they feel what this Kenya Kwanza government is implementing is half the measures they ought to, yet still spend lavishly and boast about it. This is why Kenyans have a complete lack of confidence in President Ruto’s government,” said Orengo.
He also took a swipe at the head of state for accusing foreign nations of interfering and sponsoring the protests.
President Ruto had warned unnamed foreign powers against sponsoring chaos in Kenya.
“Ruto saying foreign powers are behind the chaos is a tactic that has been used by the previous regimes and did not work. These youths are not asking for a state with a different image but one that respects the constitution and the rule of law,” said Orengo.
The Siaya County boss has also offered to represent two youths from Rongai – Joseph Ndung'u and Dennis Munini – who were arrested during the anti-government protests and are accused of robbery.
“The police want to file trumped-up charges against these defenceless young Kenyan patriots for taking part in lawful demonstrations. Being a governor does not stop me from chewing gum and climbing the stairs at the same time. I am taking up the cases,” said Orengo.
He added that abductions, enforced disappearances, arbitrary arrests and prosecutions, and extrajudicial killings are characteristic of a repressive state.",2024-07-11
https://nation.africa/kenya/counties/nakuru/christmas-tragedy-sex-worker-pleads-guilty-to-killing-colleague-in-bar-brawl-4687028,"Three days before Christmas at Club 42 Bar in Salgaa Trading Centre in Rongai, Nakuru County, a night of drinking turned deadly for two commercial sex workers.
Mercy Chepkurui Koskey and Mary Nduta Wanyoro were enjoying their evening when a confrontation ensued at around 3am.
Ms Chepkurui accidentally stepped on Nduta at the entrance of the club and although she immediately apologised, Nduta did not accept the apology and responded by slapping her friend.
A fight broke out between them and customers in the bar quickly intervened to stop it. They also advised Ms Chepkurui to go home, which she initially did.
However, the night took a tragic turn when Ms Chepkurui returned with a kitchen knife hidden in her underpants and approached Nduta who was conversing with another woman whom she gave Sh200 to go to the counter to order a drink.
But once the woman left, Ms Chepkurui, a mother of two, removed the kitchen knife and stabbed Nduta in the neck before fleeing the scene.
Some customers ran from the pub while others attempted to assist Nduta rushing her to a clinic where she was confirmed dead on arrival.
The incident was reported to Salgaa Police Station where detectives launched an investigation and traced the accused to the house of a Nyumba Kumi elder where she was arrested.
The mother of two was charged with murder which she initially denied but later changed her plea to guilty.
Admitted to killing her colleague
The Directorate of Public Prosecutions has now recommended a 20-year jail sentence for the commercial sex worker who admitted killing her colleague following a brawl.
The DPP, in a plea bargain agreement with Ms Chepkurui, proposed the sentence as a substitute for a death sentence after she agreed to plead guilty to the murder charge.
“The republic agrees to recommend a lesser sentence of 20 years imprisonment other than the penalty of death for the charge of murder as provided for under section 204 of the penal code,” read part of the plea bargain agreement dated June 12 and presented before the court on Wednesday.
Ms Chepkurui admitted to having been in the commercial sex work for six years after separating from her husband.
Nduta on the other hand has three children born of different fathers.
Justice Samuel Muhochi directed that the case be mentioned on July 29.",2024-07-11

https://www.citizen.digital/citizen-originals/period-poverty-ngo-uses-atm-to-dispense-sanitary-pads-to-students-n345673,"Period Poverty- NGO uses ATM to dispense sanitary pads to students.
“This affects my performance in class. I was forced not to come to school, and I could not focus on my studies. I missed school on so many occasions,” she says.
According to her, parents were forced to choose between feeding their family and buying essential products.
“Because of these supplies, I can change my pads when I need to instead of leaving them on for longer due to a lack of supply,” she explained.
With an estimated population of over 25 million Kenyans living in poverty, period poverty is an everyday occurrence as many households prioritize food for their families and their daily survival needs.
Initially, she was ashamed to share her ordeal with anyone. Wanjiru notes that the Ari ATM pad dispenser has magically helped her life, adding that they thought of the girls in the community because it has not been easy.
“Ever since it came, I can get my pads on time freely and with dignity. I get eight pieces every month,” she says.
Rachel Wangari, a teacher at Dandora Secondary School, notes that in severe situations, the girls would miss school, while some dropped out because of frustrations.
According to her, the high cost of living has exacerbated period poverty. Since the ATM was installed in their school, gradually, the school’s library transformed into a period hub filled with stacks of supplies.
The teacher adds that she was initially appalled when a young girl confided in her about the extreme lengths they had to go to afford sanitary pads. “We have also had to deal with girls who get into illicit relationships with men who give them money to buy pads but end up getting into more trouble, like pregnancy, abortions, and infections. This ATM is a game changer,” she said.
Alpheen Juma of Slum Sanaa says the problem is solvable but must be tackled in a variety of ways. Through her organization, they turned their library into a period product hub. Besides the supplies, she offers discussions on menstrual periods and life skills.
“I have learned that poverty is shrouded in silence, stigma, and shame. Sanitary pads are not something that any girl is supposed to struggle with; they should be provided by the government. These girls go through so much pain just to access pads,” she said.
Girls who can’t afford pads or tampons often stay home when they get their periods rather than risk being seen with stains on their clothing. They skip school and then fall behind or drop out.
“We need to have honest conversations; the government should make sure they provide pads consistently because it's an essential need. Female leaders should ensure that girls are empowered; they should champion for this,” she said.

The Head of State on Thursday dissolved his Cabinet and without providing any timelines, noted that he would engage in consultative discussions before reconstituting his new team.
The 22-member Cabinet consisted of three former elected Members of Parliament who gave up their posts for the pivotal role. They include; Former CSs Aden Duale (Defence), Kipchumba Murkomen (Transport) and Alice Wahome (Lands).
Duale gave up his Garissa Township seat which he had won for the third time after he garnered 9,905 votes against his closest competitor Abdulahi Mohamoud who had 5,509.
Murkomen successfully defended his Elgeyo Marakwet seat against former governor Alex Tolgos, garnering 141,091 votes against the latter's 20,648.
At the time, he hailed his victory as one of his best performances ever in an election.
“In the many elections I have gone through, both at nomination and election levels, this is my best performance ever,"" he said.
Wahome, who also doubles up as a lawyer, triumphed over ten contestants to retain her Kandara parliamentary seat in the 2022 elections.
Prior to the 2022 elections, the trio ditched the Jubilee administration and aligned themselves with President Ruto's United Democratic Alliance (UDA) party.
They campaigned against the ruling administration, anchoring their manifesto on uplifting hustlers on a bottom-up movement.
At the time, Duale had been ejected as National Assembly Majority Leader while Murkomen lost his position as Senate Majority Leader in radical changes instituted by former President Uhuru Kenyatta's regime.
